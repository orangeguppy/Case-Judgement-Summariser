the 1960 act makes provision for imposition of ceiling on land holdings and for determination of surplus land.
it was amended by u.p. act 18 of 1973 to lower the ceiling limit and to make provisions with regard to transfers of land in anticipation of the imposition of ceiling.
this act came into force on june 8, 1973.
further amendments were made in the act by u.p. act 2 of 1975 inserting explanation i & explanation ii after sub section (1) of section 5 as substituted by 1973 act and given effect retrospectively i.e. from june 8, 1973.
a notice under section10(2) of act was issued to the appellant and he filed objections submitting that chhiddu singh, his father, had executed a registered gift deed dated october 13, 1971 in respect of plot no. 111 measuring 63 bighas, 12 biswas and 17 dhur in favour of appellant 's mother.
appellant 's wife and two sons of the appellant.
chhiddu singh died on april 28, 1973.
accordingly the said gifted land was not inherited by the appellant and it could not be treated as part of his holding for the purpose of imposition of ceiling.
the prescribed authority overruled the objections, included the said land as part of the hold ing of the appellant and declared the surplus land of the appellant to the extent of 49 bighas and 17 biswas.
the appellant filed an appeal to the first additional civil judge.
it was allowed partly and the surplus land was reduced to 42 bighas 13 biswas and 6 dhur.
the appellant thereafter filed a writ petition in the high court which was dismissed.
feeling aggrieved the appellant filed this appeal after obtaining special leave to appeal.
the appellant urged before this court that amendments introduced by the 1973 act are not retrospective in nature and are operative only from june 8, 1973, that the surplus land has to be determined as on june 8, 1973, the date of coming into force of 1973 act, and that the 119 land gifted by the appellant 's father on october 13, 1971 could not be included in the holding of the appellant as he was not the tenure holder of the said land on the death of his father on april 28, 1973.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: the 1973 act postulates that ceiling area of a tenure holder has to be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in sec.
5 of the act.
while determining the ceiling area, the surplus land held in excess of ceiling area, which is to be acquired by the state, has also to be determined.
[123h; 124a] for determining ceiling area sub section (6) of section 5 provides that any transfer of land, which but for the transfer would have been declared surplus land under the act if made after january 24, 1971 shall be ignored and not taken into account but transfers falling within the ambit of clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to sub sec.
(6) are, excluded, and such transfers even though made after january 24, 1971, have to be taken into account.
[124b] in the instant case, the gift was made and executed on october 13, 1971 and it was a transfer of land and as it was made after january 24, 1971 the transfer of land was in respect of land which would have been declared surplus land under the act.
this transfer did not fall within the ambit of clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to sub section (6) of section 5.
thus such gift was liable to be ignored for the purpose of determining the ceiling area applicable to the appellant.
sub section (6) of section 5 does not speak of a transfer by the tenure holder but it speaks of any transfer of land made after january 24, 1971.
so the contention of the appellant that gift was made by his father and not by him as tenure holder and he did not inherit the same on the death of his father is untenable, since sub section (6) of section 5 is applicable to a transfer even made by the predecessors in interest of the tenure holder whose ceiling area is to be determined and who inherited the land prior to june 8, 1973.
the land which was transferred vide gift deed dated october 13, 1971 was land which but for the said transfer would have been declared surplus land under the act.
[124c h; 125a] thus, once the gift is ignored it is to be treated to have continued to vest in the appellant 's father and after his death the appellant inherited the same and as such was part of the holdings of the appellant on june 8, 1973 and has to be taken into consideration for determining the surplus land held by the appellant.
