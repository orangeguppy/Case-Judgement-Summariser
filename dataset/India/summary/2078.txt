the respondent was charged under sections 4 and 5 of the bombay prevention of gambling act, on the allegation that be was found accepting bets on american futures, and on being searched currency notes and two slips, on which american futures wore recorded, were found.
the trial, magistrate acquitted the respondent, which was confirmed, on appeal, by the high court.
in appeal to this court the appellant state contended that it was not necessary to examine an expert to corroborate the evidence of the prosecuting sub inspector that the articles seized were "instruments of gaming" and that the evidence of the police inspector to whom the warrant was issued under section 6 of the act did not require corroboration, in each and .very case.
held : the contentions are well founded and must be accepted as correct.
there is nothing in the act to suggest that in order to prove that the articles seized are "instruments of gamine ' it is the duty of the prosecution to examine an expert in every case.
it is open to the prosecution to prove that the articles seized are instruments of gamiag by proper evidence and it is not necessary to examine an expert for the purpose in each and every case.
it is also not proper to make a distinction between the evidence of an officer who makes a complaint under the proviso to section 6 of the act and to whom a warrant issued for search and the evidence of a person to whom a warrant is issued but who makes no such complaint under the proviso.
the question as to whether the evidence of the person who executes the warrant requires corroboration depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and no legal distinction, can be made merely because the person who executes the warrant happens to be the person who makes the complaint under the proviso to section 6 of the act to the com missioner of police or to the magistrate.
