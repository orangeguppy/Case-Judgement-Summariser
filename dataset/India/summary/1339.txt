the respondents carried on business of extraction of oil from oil seeds.
the appellant municipality charged octroi duty at rs. 4 11 0 percent ad valorem under item 44 of the schedule of goods attached to the rules framed by the municipality.
the respondent 's case was that they were liable to pay octroi under item 4 of the said rules at the rate of 2 as.
per maund.
the schedule consisted of eight classes with 67 items of goods, the serial number running consecutively.
class i was headed "articles of food or drink or use for men or animals".
item 4, which was in that class, read "oil seeds every description not specifically mentioned else where".
class v was headed "drugs, spices and gums, toilet requisites and perfumes" and item 44 which was in that class read "betel nuts, gums, spices, sarso etc.
and known as kirana" (groceries). 'i`he single judge who heard the matter in the first instance held in favour of the appellant but the court of appeal held in favour of the respondent.

the words not specifically mentioned elsewhere" in item 4 of the schedule must mean mention as an oil seed.
the words "known as kirana" in item 44 clearly indicated that sarso fell within its ambit only as a spice or as kirana and not as an oil seed.
