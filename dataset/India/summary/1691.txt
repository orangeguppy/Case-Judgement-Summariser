the minor respondent no. i brought a suit for partition on a claim that on his birth he became a member of the joint hindu family which his father sadagopa naidu, the first defendant, in the suit, formed with the other nine persons impleaded as defendants 2 to 10.
his case was that padmavathi and sada gopa were validly married on june 24, 1948 and of that marriage he was born.
the case of the defendant was that the impugned marriage was not a valid marriage as padmavathi was a brahmin girl and sada gopa a shudra.
on these facts the trial court passed a preliminary decree for partition in favour of the respondent no. 1.
the trial court was of opinion that the marriage would be invalid according to the hindu law as it stood before the hindu marriages validity act, 1949.
it held however that the position had been entirely changed by section 3 of the hindu marriages validity act, 1949 and that the marriage was validated by the act of 1949.
on appeal by the defendants, the high court affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court.
hence this appeal.
held: (i) the hindu marriages validity act, 1949 was however in terms retrospective and validated marriages that had taken place before the act between parties belonging to different 912 castes, sub castes and sects.
it is idle to say that the object of the legislature was only to regularise the status of the husband and the wife.
that certainly was part of the object.
but equally important, or perhaps more important object was that the children of the marriages would become legitimate.
on the facts of this case it was held that the impugned marriage was a valid hindu marriage and the respondent no. 1 a legitimate son of sadagopa with all the rights of a coparcener in regard to the joint family properties and other matters.
