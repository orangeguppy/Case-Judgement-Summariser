the question for determination in these appeals was whether and to what extent the municipal activities of the corporation of 943 nagpur city fell within the term 'industry ' as defined by section 2 (14.) of the c.p. and berar industrial disputes settlement act, 1947.
disputes having arisen between the said corporation and its employees in its various departments, the state government referred them for adjudication to the state industrial court under section 39 of the act and that court by its award held that the corporation and all its departments were covered by the said definition.
against that award the corporation made an application to the high court under article 26 of the constitution.
the high court rejected its contention that the corporation was not an industry within the meaning of the said section and remanded the case to the industrial court for determination as to which of its departments fell within the definition and making an award accordingly.
thereafter the industrial court found all the departments of the corporation except those dealing with (1) assessment and levy of house tax (2) assessment and levy of octroi, (3) removal of encroachment and removal and pulling down of dilapidated houses, (4) prevention and control of food adulteration, and (5) maintenance of cattle pounds, to be industries within the meaning of the definition and passed its award accordingly.
the corporation appealed to this court by special leave but there was no appeal on behalf of the employees of the five departments excluded from the definition.
held, that the decision of the industrial court except so far as it related to the five departments in respect of which the re was no appeal, must be affirmed.

it is not necessary that an activity of the corporation must share the common characteristics of an industry before it can come within the section.
the words of section 2 (14) of the act are clear and unambiguous and the maxim noscitur a socii can have no application.
the history of industrial disputes and the legislation, however, recognises the basic concept that the activity must be an organised one and not one that pertains to private or personal employment.

but the definition, however wide, cannot include the regal, primary and inalienable, functions of the state though statutorily delegated to a corporation and the ambit of such functions cannot be extended so as to include the welfare activities of a modern state and must be confined to legislative power, administration of law and judicial power.
