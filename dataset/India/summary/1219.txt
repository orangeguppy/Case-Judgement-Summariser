these persons did not appear and contest the proceedings.
the petitioners claimed to be entitled to certain shares in the houses.
no notice under section 7 of the act had at any time been served on them and they had never been declared evacuees.
one of the petitioners filed an appeal under the act to the custodian general which was dismissed as time barred.
the petitioners then filed a petition under article 32 of the constitution of india on the ground that they were being wrongfully deprived of their shares in the houses.

the petitioner who had filed the appeal did not thereby lose his rights in the houses either as the appeal did not decide any question as to such rights but was dismissed on the sole ground that it was filed beyond the time prescribed for it.

section 12 of the , only affects the rights of an evacuee in his property.
