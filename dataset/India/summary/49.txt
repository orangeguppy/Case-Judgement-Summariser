the respondents agreed to deliver 61 bales of cloth to the appellant by the 17th november, 1941.

" in a suit for damages for non deliv ery of the goods the respondents pleaded that as they had not received the goods from the victoria mills before the 17th of november, 1941, performance of the contract had become impossible by reason of an event which they could not prevent and the contract had therefore become void under sec.
