a family dispute between the parties pertaining to movable and immovable property left intestate by their father was referred by them to arbitration.
the award made on february 12, 1977 stated: (i) that the appellant should pay to the 1st respondent a specified sum, on payment of which she will have no right to live in the house and also have no other interests in the said property as a legal heir; (ii) that till the full amount was paid she would be entitled to live in the portion of the house in her occupa tion and not be liable to pay any rent; (iii) that the 2nd respondent shall have right of residence in the said house.
plus right to receive from the appellant a specified sum per month as maintenance for life or till she is married; and (iv) that in case of her marriage the appellant should pay her the specified sum upon which she will have no right to live in the house or get any maintenance.
the aforesaid award was filed in court on march 10, 1977 and accepted by the appellant and the 2nd respondent on may 11, 1977.
the first respondent filed her objection to the award on october 1977 on two grounds: (i) that being unregistered it was incapable of being made the rule of the court in terms of section 17 of the , and (ii) that the second respondent being mentally retarded could not be a party to the arbitration proceedings.
the high court upheld the first objection but not the second.
152 in this appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellant that even if the award was not properly registered as required under section 17 of the , in view of the fact that it was filed within a period of one month of its making and since four months time was there to have the award registered by the arbitrator the court should have exercised its powers under section 15(b) and section 16(1)(c) of the .
for the first respondent it was contended that the award effected partition of immovable property and having not been registered it could not be made a rule of the court.
allowing the appeal, held: 1.1 the award did not create any right in any immovable property,.
nor did it effect partition in any immovable property.
it was, therefore, not compulsory to register the award.
[162g] 1.2 the award merely indicated the entitlement of the respondent in the property and the cessor of their interest in the property on receipt of money.
their right and inter est was to cease only on the payment of the amount and not otherwise, not even by the operation of the document itself.
[161b c] 1.3 the award only declared that the right of the appel lant to get the immovable property was dependent upon the payment of the amount by him.
a right to the property was not created by the award itself, a right to certain property was declared.
a right to get the property was declared on the payment of the money.
the award did not create any right to the property, extinguish any right to the property, which was not there.
it quantified in terms of money the value of that right and declared the method of working out those rights.

the purpose of remitting the award under section 16(d(c) of the is to enable the arbitrator to recon sider his decision where legality was connected with the decision as contained in the award.
it must not relate to a matter which has no connection with the decision or decree.
[159h; 160a] 153 in the instant case, there was no objection to the legality of the award.
the factum of registration of the award did not pertain to the decision of the arbitration on its merits and was de hors the award and for this purpose the award could not be remitted to the arbitrator under section 16 of the act.
