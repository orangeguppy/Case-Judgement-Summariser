the respondent society formed a housing colony, laid out public roads and set apart public common places for parks.
play grounds, schools, library, hospital and club for the benefit of the members of the colony.
the respondent passed a resolution for handing over the roads and the other common places to the appellant panchayat, but later, passed another resolution cancelling it.
the appellant, thereupon, filed a suit for an injunction restraining the respondent from obstructing the appellant in the exercise of its statutory duties in relation to the roads and other common places.
the high court, on appeal, held that the streets and the roads in the colony alone would vest in the appellant under the madras village panchayats act, 1950 and that, an injunction could be granted only with respect to them, but not, with respect to the other amenities which the respondent had provided for the residents of the colony.
in appeal to this court, it was contended that the amenities excluded would also vest in the appellant under section 58 of the act, especially because they had been dedicated to the public.
held:the scope of the section must be confined to communal property and income of the panchayat which, by custom, belong to the villagers in common, or, has been administered for their benefit as a matter of custom.
therefore, the section cannot be extended to amenities such as parks, play grounds etc.
provided by the respondent for the benefit of the members of the colony; and dedication is not a relevant circumstance in considering its scope and meaning.
