the management by a notice terminated the services of 39 workmen as a measure of retrenchment.
the workmen went on strike which led to an industrial dispute.
the industrial tribunal interalia held that the strike was not justified and that the management had made out of a case of necessity for retrenchment and no malafides had been established; but the principle of last come first go had not been observed in selecting the personnel for retrenchment and ordered the reinstatement of 15 out of the 39 workmen retrenched.
the appellate tribunal confirmed the findings of the industrial tribunal with certain modifications by way of compensation.
the management came up in appeal by special leave.
held, that where a case of retrenchment is made out the employer has normally to follow the industrial rule of retrenchment last come and first go; for valid reasons he may however depart from the said rule; in that case he has to show by reliable evidence, preferably from the recorded history of the workmen concerned showing their inefficiency, unreliability or habitual irregularity and can satisfy the tribunal that the departure from the rule was justified by sound and valid reasons; otherwise the departure from the rule could be treated as being malafidc or amounting to unfair labour practice.
held, further that once it was found that retrenchment was unjustified and improper it is for the tribunal to consider to what relief the retrenched workmen will be entitled; ordinarily retrenched workmen would be entitled to claim reinstatement, and the fact that in the meantime the employer has engaged other workmen would not necessarily defeat the claim for reinstatement, nor would the fact that protracted litigation in regard to the dispute has inevitably meant delay defeat such a claim for reinstatement.
therefore the conclusion that 15 workmen were improperly retrenched cannot be sucessfully challenged.
