by para 4 of a notification issued under section 15 of the police act the rajasthan government exempted the harijan and muslim inhabitants of certain villages from payment of the cost of additional police force stationed therein.
the notification was challenged as being violative of the guarantee contained in article 15(i) of the constitution of india.
held, that since para 4 of the notification had discriminated against the law abiding members of other communities and in favour of the muslims and harijans on the grounds of caste and religion, it was directly hit by the provision of article 15(i) of the constitution and as such must be declared to be invalid.
