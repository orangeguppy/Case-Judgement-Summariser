(3)there is nothing in section 5(1) of the act even after the amendment in 1960 to compel the special judge to comply with the provisions of section 200 cr.
the words "in the manner laid down in clauses (a) and (b) of sub section
(1) of section 190 of the criminal procedure code 1898" do not automatically introduce the provisions of section 200 cr. p. c. of chapter xvi, nor do the above words in section 5(2) of the act, mandatorily compel the special judge to resort to the provisions of chapter xvi.
the legislature in the above amendment has advisedly omitted to include section 200 cr. p. c. and the other provisions in chapter xvi of the criminal procedure code.
[385 h, 386 a, e, f] (4)because of the amendment of section 5(2) in 1960, it may now be open to the special judge to apply his judicial mind to the complaint apart from 383 allotment of the case in order to come to a decision as to whether he is satisfied on the materials laid before him at that stage to take cognizance of the offence and proceed to trial.
if he chooses to examine the complainant or any witness before issuing process against any accused, there is nothing in law to prevent him from doing so.
if he does not do so and is satisfied on perusal of the complaint after allotment of the case by the government that an offence has been disclosed against definite persons, no valid objection could be taken against his taking cognizance on the written complaint without complying with the provisions of section 200 criminal procedure code.
no grievance can be made then that the special judge has not examined the complainant under section 200, cr. p. c. period to issuing of process.
