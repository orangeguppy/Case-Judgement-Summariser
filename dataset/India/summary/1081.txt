the respondents were assessed to sales tax under the travancore cochin general sales tax act and proceedings were started against them under section 13 of the act for the recovery of the arrears of sales tax as if they were arrears of land revenue.
the proceedings were not fruitful.
thereafter a prosecution under section 19 of the act was instituted against the partners who pleaded guilty and the magistrate issued warrants under section 386(1)(b) of the code of criminal procedure to the collector of the district for the recovery of the arrears of sales tax as if they were a fine imposed by that court.
the authorities again started proceedings under section 13 of the act read with travancore cochin revenue recovery act, 1951, and certain properties were attached.
the respondents urged that in as much as they were prosecuted under section 19 of the act and the magistrate had issued warrants, the procedure for recovery under section 13 of the act was not available.
the question was whether section 19 was to be taken to prevail over section 13 of the act.
held, that neither of the remedies for recovery of arrears of tax as laid down by sections 13 and 19 of the travancore cochin general sales tax act was destructive of each other and unless the statute laid down in express words or by necessary implication that one remedy was to the exclusion of the other, both the remedies were open to the authorities and they could resort to any one of them at their option.
