a writ petition was filed in the high court challenging the communication of respondent no. 2 corporation, directing that no development be made in the disputed land, and no building construction permitted within a certain distance from the chemical factories in view of the representations of the owners of the factories.
the high court allowed the writ petition and struck down the aforesaid communication.
being aggrieved and adversely affected by the judgment, some of the owners of the chemical factories, even though they were not parties in the writ petition, filed a special leave petition.
disposing of the appeal, this court, held: (1) appellants can be said to be parties aggrieved by the judgment, even if they are not regarded as necessary parties in the writ petition.
[251g 252a] (2) in the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no need to set aside the judgment of the high court at the instance of the appellants.
they are, given liberty to file a review petition before the high court.
the review petition, if filed, shall be entertained by the high court and the appellants given a hearing as if the matters were heard afresh as far as they are concerned.
it is clarified that the review application will not be confined to the normal grounds on which a review can be sought but 251 the entire controversy will be regarded as open as between the appellants and the respondents.
