the respondent filed an election petition in the high court alleging that the returned candidate (petitioner herein) had committed corrupt practices which rendered his election void.
the returned candidate made an application stating that the respondent had committed breach of the mandatory provisions of section 81 (3) in that with the copy of the election petition served on him, copies of documents and schedules which formed an integral part of the election petition, had not been enclosed and that for this reason the election petition was liable to be dismissed in limine under section 86.
the high court dismissed his application.
in the special leave petition the returned candidate has urged the same argument advanced by him before the high court.
dismissing the petition, ^ held: there is no requirement of law that the documents or schedules to the election petition should also be served on the candidate because if they were filed in court it is always open to the returned candidate to inspect them and find out the allegations made in the petition.
documents or schedules do not form an integral part of the election petition.
[897e f] in the instant case all that was necessary to be done by the election petitioner had been done.
the election petition was accompanied by as many copies as there were respondents.
it was duly verified and copies thereof were accompanied by necessary schedules containing the details of corrupt practices and the schedules were also signed by the petitioner.
[897e f] 895 sahodrabai rai vs ram singh aharwar, [1968 3 scr and m. v. hande, , held inapplicable.
