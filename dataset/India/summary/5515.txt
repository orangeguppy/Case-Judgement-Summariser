% the appellants were contractors for the supply of ballast to pwd.
they were detained under section 3(2) of the .
it was stated in the grounds of detention that on account of business rivalry, appellants and their companions attacked the complainant with fire arms and hand grenades with intent to kill him, fir was lodged by the complainant, a case was registered against them under section 147, 149, 307 i.p.c. and section 6 of the explosives act, and a chargesheet put up against the appellants, and since they had applied for bail, and if released there was a possibility that they will again start activities causing breach of public order, it was necessary to detain them in order to prevent them from so acting.
the detention orders were approved by the state government under section 3(4) of the act, and the representations made by the appellants having been rejected they were directed to be detained for a period of 12 months.
challenging their detention, the appellants filed writ petitions before the high court contending that the alleged assault on the complainant affected only an individual and such a solitary act could not be considered to be an act prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
the high court, dismissing the writ petitions, held that the assault was to teach a lesson to the complainant and serve as warning to prospective tenderers who may not dare to submit their tenders and that the impact and reach of the act went beyond the individual and affected the community of contractors who take contracts for executing the public works.
allowing the appeals to this court, 774 ^ held: disturbance of public order is to be distinguished from acts directed against individuals which do not disturb the society to the extent of causing a general disturbance of public tranquility.
an act by itself is not determinant of its own gravity in its quality it may not differ from another but in its potentiality it may be different.
[778c d] a solitary act of omission or commission can be taken into consideration for being subjectively satisfied, by the detaining authority to pass an order of detention if the reach, effect and potentiality of the act is such that it disturbs public tranquility by creating terror and panic in the society or a considerable number of the people in a specified locality where the act is alleged to have been committed.
it is the degree and extent of the reach of the act upon the society which is vital for considering the question whether a man has committed only a breach of law and order or has acted in a manner likely to cause disturbance to public order.
[779a c] in the instant case, the alleged act of assault by fire arms is confined to the complainant and not to others.
it is an act infringing law and order and the reach and effect of the act is not so extensive as to affect considerable members of the society.
in other words, this act does not disturb public tranquility, nor does it create any terror or panic in the minds of the people of the locality nor does it affect in any manner the even tempo of the life of the community.
this criminal act emanates from business rivalry between the detenus and the complainant.
therefore, such an act cannot be the basis for subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority to pass an order of detention on the ground that the impugned act purports to affect public order i.e. the even tempo of the life of the community, which is the sole basis for clamping the order of detention.
moreover, no injury was caused to the person of the complainant, by the appellants nor any damage was caused to the car though hand grenade was alleged to have been thrown on the car.
no mark has been caused to the car also.
