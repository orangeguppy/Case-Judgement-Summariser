in the reference to the industrial tribunal, the tribunal held that as the employer dispensed with the disciplinary enquiry in exercise of the power conferred by standing order 32, it could not be said that the dismissal from service was not justified, and that if there were allegations of misconduct, the employer was quite competent to pass an order of removal from service without holding any enquiry any in view of the provisions contained in standing order 32, and rejected the reference.

the reasons for dispensing with the enquiry do not spell out what was the nature of the misconduct alleged to have been committed by the appellant and what prompted the general manager to dispense with the enquiry.

(i) standing order 32, nowhere obligates the general manager to record reasons for dispensing with the inquiry as prescribed by standing order 31.
on the contrary, the language of standing order 32 enjoins a duty upon the general manager to record reasons for his satisfaction why it was inexpedient ar against the interest of the security of the state to continue to employ the workman.
ressons for dispensing with the enquiry an reasons for not continuing to employ the workman stand, wholly apart from each other.
[435c d] 430 (ii) a standing order which confers such arbitrary.
uncanalised and drastic power to dismiss an employee by merely stating that it is inexpedient or against the interest of security to continue to employ the workman is violative of the basis c requirement of natural justice, as tho general manger can impose penalty of such a drastic nature as to affect the livelihood and put a stigma on the character of the workman without recording reasons why disciplinary enquiry is dispensed with and, what was the misconduct 13 alleged against the employee.
