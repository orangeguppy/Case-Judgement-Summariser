under section 4(1)(c) of the district municipalities act, 1920, the state government declared its intention to include within the limits of the appellant municipality the local areas comprised in two villages. 'the 1920 act was repealed by the andhra pradesh municipalities act, 1965 which came into force on april 2, 1965.
section 3(1)(b) of the 1965 act corresponds to section 4(1)(c) of the repealed act.
under s.3(3), the government may include within a municipality a local area after considering any objections submitted by the residents of the local are: under section 3(4) the provisions of the 1965 act come into force in that area on the first april, if that is the date of the notification under sub section
(3) and in any other cases the first day of april immediately succeeding.
the state government, in exercise of its power under section 3(3) of the 1965 act, issued the notification in march 1966 including within the limits of the appellant municipality the areas comprised in the two villages with effect from april 1, 1966.
in 1971, the municipal council after considering objections, passed a resolution for levying property tax on land and buildings in the two villages with effect from october 1, 1970, but, the municipality issued notices to the respondents, who were residents of those two villages, demanding the property tax from them from april 1, 1966 the date of inclusion of the villages.
the respondents thereupon challenged the levy and the high court upheld the challenge.
in appeal to this court, it was contended that the appellant municipality was entitled to demand the tax even from april 1, 1966, under cl. 12 of schedule 9 of the 1965 act.
this clause provided that any tax which was being lawfully levied by the municipal council at the commencement of the 1965 act and which may be lawfully levied under that act shall continue to be levied by the council unless the government by general or special order directs otherwise.
dismissing the appeal to this court, ^ held :(1) the inclusion of the two villages within the limits of the appellant municipality is in order, because, under cl. 13 of schedule 9 of the 1965 act the notification issued under section 4(1) of the 1920 act must be deemed to have been issued under section 3 (1) of the 1965 act.
[547 d f] (2) however, clause 12 of schedule 9 cannot justify the imposition of the tax under the repealed act of 1920, from april 1, 1966, on property situate in the newly included areas.
[548 b c] (a) the clause is of a transitional nature and its object is to authorise the levy of taxes which, at the commencement of the 1965 act were levied under the repealed law.
that is, in the present case, if any tax etc. was being lawfully levied by the appellant on april 1, 1966, (which was the date of commencement of the act in the two villages) and if it can be lawfully levied under the 1965 act, it can continue to be levied.
but on april 1, 1966, no tax at all.
was being levied by or on behalf of the appellant on the property situate in the two villages included within the municipality on that date.
therefore, the appellant had no occasion or power to direct that a property tax may continue to be levied on those properties, and hence cl.
12 has no application.
[548 c e] (b) it cannot be urged that because the appellant was levying property tax on property situate within its limits (other than the 2 villages) the property tax was not being levied for the first time.
qua the two villages newly 545 included in the municipal limits, the tax was being imposed for the first time, and therefore, it was incumbent upon the municipality to follow the procedure prescribed by the first proviso to section 81(2), because, the residents of these areas had no opportunity to object lo the imposition of tax or for the municipality to invite objections and consider them.
[549 c e] (3) the first proviso to section 81 requires that before passing a resolution imposing a tax for the first time the council shall publish a notice, invite objections and consider the objections received within the stipulated time.
since the procedure was not followed in regard to the period prior to october 1, 1970 the levy of property tax on the properties of the respondents for that period is without authority of law and consequently illegal.
by section 83 when a council determines to levy any tax for the first time or at a new rate the secretary shall forthwith publish a notification in the prescribed manner specifying the rate and the date from which the tax shall be levied.
section 83 is expressly subject to section 81 and under the latter provision no tax can be imposed for the first time unless the procedure prescribed therein is followed [548g 549 b] (4) when the state government issued the notification declaring its intention to include the two villages within the limits of the municipality the residents had an opportunity to object, not to the imposition of the tax but only to "any thing contained therein", meaning anything contained in the notification, that is to the inclusion within the municipality.
the question of imposition of a tax within the included areas, arises only after the final notification under section 3(3) followed by a resolution under section 81 (1) .
[547f 550 b] (5) it could not also be contended that mere inclusion of two villages with in the municipal area automatically attracts the tax.
on the contrary, what section . (4) provides is that once a notification including any area within a municipality is published under section 3(3), the provisions of the act, that is, sections 81 and 83, shall come into force in that area from the first day of april, and hence, the procedure prescribed therein will have to be followed.[550 f h] atlas cycle industries ltd. vs state of haryana & anr. ; , explained.
