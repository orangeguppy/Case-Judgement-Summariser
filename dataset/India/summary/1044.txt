in 1945 the appellant who was a zamindar granted licences to different parties to prospect bauxite.
under the licence the licensee had the right to enter upon the land to prospect, dig and prove all bauxite lying in or within the land and to take away and appropriate samples of bauxite in reasonable quantities not exceeding 100 tons in the aggregate.
in consideration of the premium paid, the licensees could, at their option, after giving necessary notice and on payment of a further sum, get a mining lease for a term of thirty years.
the income tax authorities were of the view that the licensees were not granted any interest in land and that the amounts received by the appellant from the licensees were revenue receipts and, therefore, assess able to income tax.
held, that on its true construction the transaction of 1945 did not amount merely to a grant of the use of the capital of the licensor but was really a grant of a right to a portion of the capital.
accordingly, the amounts received by the appellant were capital receipts and, therefore, not liable to income tax.
