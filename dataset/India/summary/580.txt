the time limit of six months provided by section 5 of the bengal tenancy act within which a tenure holder has to give notice of his succession to the landlord or have his name mutated in his rent roll is not mandatory but directory in character and the only effect which non observance of that time limit can have under section 16 of the act, is to postpone his remedy to recover arrears of rent by way of suit till such time when he performs the duty cast upon him by section 5 of the act, but it cannot, by itself, bar the remedy for all time to come.
section 16 is a penal provision and must be subjected to its statutory limitation and the penalty it imposes cannot be extended by implication.
consequently, in a case where the sepatnidar resisted the durpatnidars ' suit for recovery of arrears of rent on the ground, inter alia, that they had not got themselves mutated in the landlord 's records under section 15 of the bengal tenancy act and as such 227 the suit was barred under section 16 of the act and the courts below found on the evidence adduced by the durpatnidars that the landlord had accepted rents from them and granted receipts after ordering mutation of their names in the rent roll: held, that the courts below were right in holding in favour of the durpatnidars that there was the necessary mutation in the landlord 's rent roll.
the factum of mutation in the landlord 's rent roll can be proved not only by the production of original rent roll or its certified copy but,failing these, also by other secondary proof of mutation.
