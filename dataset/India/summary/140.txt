the court of wards granted to the appellants a large area of land belonging to the bettiah raj which was then under the management of the court of wards, on the recommendation of the board of revenue, at half the usual rates.
a few years later, the working committee of the indian national congress expressed the opinion that the settlement of the lands was against public interest, and in 1950, the bihar legislature passed an act called the sathi lands (restoration) act, 1950, which declared that, notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force the settlement granted to the appellants shall be null and void and that no party to the settlement or his successors in interest shall be deemed to have acquired any right or incurred any liability thereunder, and empowered the collector to eject the appellants if they refused to restore the lands.
the appellants, alleging that the act was unconstitutional, applied under article 226 of the constitution for a writ of mandamus against the state of bihar restraining it from taking any action under the act.
it was found that there were several other settlements of lands belonging to the bettiah raj on similar terms against which the government had taken no action: held, that the dispute between the appellants and the state was really a private dispute and a matter to be determined by a judicial tribunal in accordance with the law applicable to the case, and, as the legislature had, in passing the impugned enactment singled out the appellants and deprived them of their right to 1130 have this dispute adjudicated upon by a duly constituted court, the enactment contravened the provisions of article 14 of the constitution which guarantees to every citizen the equal protection of the laws, and was void.
legislation which singles out a particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposed upon the others and against which even the right of complaint is taken away is highly discriminatory.
though the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it has to be presumed that a legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, yet when on the face of a statute there is no classification at all, and no attempt has been made to select any individual or group with reference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to that individual or group and not possessed by others, this presumption is of little or no assistance to the state.
