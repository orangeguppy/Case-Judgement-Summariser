by a sale deed executed on november 24, 1944 the appellant company purchased certain land located in an area now part of west pakistan.
after the partition of india, the company, on the basis of a registered sale deed, was allotted certain land in kapurthala in 1950 in lieu of the land abandoned in pakistan.
on a report made by the managing officer, respondeat no. 3 on august 30, 1960 recommending cancellation of the allotment of land to the company and after hearing the company, the chief settlement commissioner rejected the registered sale deed and came to the conclusion that at the time of partition the company did not own any land in pakistan nor was it in occupation of any such land.
therefore by his order dated february 27, 1961, he set aside the permanent rights acquired by the company.
held: the order of the chief settlement commissioner must be quashed on the ground that there is no finding of the chief settlement commissioner that the company had obtained allotment of the land "by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of any material fact" within the meaning of section 24(2) of the act.
it is true that the chief settlement commissioner had recorded a finding that the company had not proved its title to any land in the area now part of pakistan and the allotment was "undeserved".
but this is not tantamount to a finding that the allotment had been obtained by a false representation or fraud or concealment of material facts.
such a finding is a condition precedent for faking action under section 24(2) of the act.
the condition imposed by the section is mandatory and in the absence of any such finding the chief settlement commissioner had no jurisdiction to cancel the allotment made to the company under section 24(2) of the act.
