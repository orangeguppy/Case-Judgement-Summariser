in these five appeals by certificate of fitness, question arose as to whether the answers of the high court of patna given in the tax references on the question of correctness of valuation of the "net wealth" under section 7 of the wealth tax act, 1957 are correct.
the revenue urged the following five propositions: (l) for the purposes of computation of net wealth of an assessee each asset belonging to him and each debt owed by him has to be valued separately.
(2) the difference between the aggregate value of the assets and the aggregate value of the debts represents his net wealth.
626 (3) in determining the market value of an asset (or the residue of the asset diminished by an over riding title on the asset itself), any liability or debt incurred in relation to it has to be ignored as the debt or liability has to he separately evaluated.
(4) what is the market value of a certain asset or the residue asset as referred to above, is a question of fact, to be determined finally by the income tax appellate tribunal taking into account the relevant evidence and considerations put forward by both the sides and the high court cannot interfere with such a fielding of fact unless it is found to be based on irrelevant consideration or is arrived at by ignoring , relevant evidence (5) when the debt is represented as an asset, its market value has to be determined in the same manner as the market value of any other asset irrespective of the fact whether such an asset debt is encumbered by another debt owed from the assessee, because the later mentioned debt can qualify for deduction at its market value independently.
