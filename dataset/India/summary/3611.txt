the respondent, an assistant teacher in the basic sec tion of the colvin taluqdar 's college, lucknow, was suspend ed and then removed from service, by the managing committee of the college.
she flied a writ petition in the high court challenging her dismissal order, contending that it violated the regulations framed under the (u.p.) intermediate educa tion act, 1921.
the appellants contended that the col lege was running the basic section independently and without any affiliation or grants from the government or any local body, and that the said act did not apply.
the single judge of the high court dismissed the writ petition as none of the opposite parties was a public au thority.
an appeal was allowed by a division bench of the high court on the ground that the basic section was an integral part of the college and was run by a managing committee constituted under the intermediate education act.
allowing the appeal the court, held: the provisions of the act relate to recognized institutions; recognition is by the board for the purpose of preparing candidates for admission to the board 's examina tion; board means the board of high school and lntermedi ate education.
the basic section of a college cannot there fore be part of a recognised institution.
it is not correct to think that since section 16a of the act requires a college to have a committee of management, a managing committee that looks after the affairs of the basic section of the college must also be functioning as a statutory body discharging duties under the act and governed by the regula tions framed thereunder.
an institution by extending its operation to fields beyond that covered by the act cannot extend the ambit of the act to include in its sweep, these new fields of education which are.
outside its scope.
