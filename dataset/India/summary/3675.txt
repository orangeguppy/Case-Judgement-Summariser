the respondent carries on business, inter alia, of supplying photo prints to those who get themselves photo graphed at his studios.
sales tax authorities assessed him and levied sales tax on his supply of photo prints.
the respondent filed a writ petition in the high court contend ing that in supplying photo prints, he did not enter into sale transactions but only undertook contracts of work and labour.
he also refuted the appellant 's contention that a finished photograph was a marketable commodity.
the high court allowed the writ petition holding the respondent not liable to pay sales tax on the supply of photo prints.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: (1) when a photographer undertakes to take photo graph, develop the negative, or do other photographic work and thereafter supply the prints to his client, he cannot be said to enter into a contract for sale of goods.
the con tract on the contrary is for use of skill and labour by the photographer to bring about desired result.

(2) a contract of sale is one whose main object is the transfer of property in, and the delivery of the possession of, a chattel as a chattel to the buyer.
where the principal object of work undertaken by the payee of the price is not the transfer of a chattel qua chattel, the contract is one of work and labour.
the test is whether or not the work and labour bestowed end in anything that can properly become the subject of sale.
