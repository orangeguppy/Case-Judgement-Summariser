section 73(i)(iv) of the bombay municipal boroughs act 1925 empowers a municipal borough to impose octroi on animals or goods or both brought within the octroi limits for consumption, use of sale therein.
the appellant imported certain consignments of goods within the octroi limits of the municipality and exported them, the consignments being termed as "through consignments" or "goods in transit" or "goods for export".
octroi duty was imposed on the goods and the appellant filed a petition before the high court challenging the levy.
the high court held that the expression 'sale ' used in the definition of "through consignments" in the rules had the same connotation as in the sale of goods act and, therefore, if a consignment was brought within the octroi limits and if the municipal authorities were satisfied that the consignment had been brought in for the purpose of sale, then the consignment did not become a through consignment.
allowing the appeal to this court, ^ held: the law on the subject has been clearly laid down in burmah shell oil storage and distributing company (india) ltd. vs the belgaum borough municipality and the present case is governed by that decision.
it was held in that case that the company was liable to pay octroi on goods brought into the local area, if the goods are: (a) to be consumed by the company itself or sold by it to consumers direct and (b) for sale to dealers who in their turn sold the goods to consumers within the municipal area and irrespective of whether such consumer bought them for use in the area or outside it; but it was not liable to octroi in respect of goods which were brought into the local area and were re exported.
