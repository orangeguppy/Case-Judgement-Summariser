the two appellants and one other person were accused of committing a murder.
the second appellant made a confession before a magistrate.
the police submitted a charge sheet against the three accused.
thereafter the prosecution made a prayer to the sub divisional magistrate that the second appellant may be tendered a pardon under section 337, code of criminal procedure and the magistrate recorded an order to the effect that he was tendered a pardon under section 337 on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge.
before the committing magistrate the second appellant stated that the confession made by him was not voluntary and that he did not wish to become an approver.
the appellants were committed to the court of sessions and were convicted of the murder and were sentenced to death.
on appeal the high court confirmed the conviction and sentence.
it was contended by the appellants that the second appellant having been tendered a pardon the joint trial of the appellants was vitiated as it was barred by the proviso to section 339(i) of the code.
held, that there was no effective pardon under section 337 of the code and consequently the provisions of section 339 did not come into operation in this case.
a mere tender of pardon does not attract the provisions of section 339 ; there must be an acceptance of the pardon by the accomplice and he must be examined as a witness.
it is only after this that section 339 comes into play if the accomplice who has accepted the pardon fails to comply with the conditions on which the pardon was tendered.
in the present case though a tender of pardon was made to the second appellant there was no proof that it was accepted by him and as such it could not be said that there was in existence an effective pardon under section 337.
