held: in the face of the appellant 's promotion a few months before his compulsory retirement under f. r. 56 (d) and nothing even mildly suggestive of ineptitude or inefficiency after his promotion, it is impossible to sustain the order of the government retiring him from service.
[79 g] when the government exonerated him of the charges levelled against him, the basis of the adverse entry in his confidential file was knocked out.
by reason of the promotion of the selection post of deputy commissioner and posting as a member of the sales tax appellate tribunal, the effect of the entry was further blotted out.
since then, there was no adverse entry in his service record to discredit him or hinting even remotely that he had outlived his utility as a government servant.
had there been another adverse entry after his promotion it would have been possible to read them all in conjunction and say that it was time for him to quit government service.
but that was not so.
it was therefore odd that he was retired a few months after his promotion.
[79 a c] 76 all this is not to say that previous history of a government servant should be completely ignored once he is promoted.
sometimes past events might help to assess the present conduct, but when there was nothing in the present conduct casting any doubt on the wisdom of the promotion there was no justification for needless digging into the past.
