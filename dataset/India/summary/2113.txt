orders of reassessment under section 16(3) read with section 17(b) of the wealth tax act were, passed by the wealth tax officer in respect of two assessment years, and by those orders, amounts which had been formerly allowed as deduction were included in the total wealth of the respondent.
the orders were set aside by the tribunal on the ground that the reassessment was based on a mere change or opinion on the part of the officer, because, there was no "information" in his possession, as required by section 17(b), which could lead him to believe that chargeable wealth of the respondent had escaped assessment.
the appellant 's applications to the tribunal and the high court, for a reference to the high court, were dismissed.
in appeal to this court, held: the tribunal should be directed to make a reference either to the high court under section 27(1) or to this court under section 27 (3a) of the wealth tax act.
[179 g].
there is a divergence of opinion among the high courts as to the meaning of the word "information" in.
section 34(1) (b) of the income tax act, and some high courts have taken the view that a change of opinion by the income tax officer, in certain circumstances, will justify the issue of notice under section 34 (1)(b) of the income tax act.
since that section is in pari materia with section 17(b) of the wealth tax act, a question of law did irises a,; to the interpretation of the word "information" in section 17(b) of the wealth tax act and it should have been referred by the tribunal to the high court.
