the government of andhra pradesh issued an order dated 18.11.81 which provided that in respect of appointments to nongazetted posts of all services, candidates who have obtained their basic educational qualification through the medium of telugu shall be given weightage of 5% marks.
but the benefit of the order was confined to selection made through the state public service commission.
the state administrative tribunal held that the order applies to ' all selections irrespective of the body that makes selection in the state and extended the benefit of the order to the selection of the sub inspectors of police made through the state level recruitment board.
against the order of the tribunal, the state of andhra pradesh filed an appeal to this court.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in lifting the restriction imposed by the government in the matter of benefit of 5% marks.
the order of the tribunal is vacated.
[567d e] 2.
the state government is the authority to take a policy decision.
whether the decision is tenable or not in law, is not to be decided by the court.
since government in their wisdom have specifically confined the application of the notification to recruitment through the state public service commission, the decision of the tribunal that it was also available to be extended to selection through bodies other than the state public service commission, cannot be appreciated.
[566h, 567a] 565 3.
when the notification is specific and is intended to apply to a specified group of cases for selection, it would not be open to the tribunal to extend its application beyond what has been clearly specified.
it is one matter to say that the notification applied in a limited way may he hit by law; it is another to say that contrary to the restriction imposed, the tribunal would allow the notification to have general application.
