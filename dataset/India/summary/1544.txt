in order to create evidence in his favour c got a false report entered by the appellant, a head constable, in the general diary purporting to have been made on the previous day to the effect that 0 had deposited his gun.
c and the appellant and the others were tried for various offences including offences under sections 304 a and 218/109 indian penal code.
all the accussed were acquitted but the appellant was convicted under section 218.
the appellant contended that after the acquittal of c, his conviction under section 218 couple not be sustained and (ii) that the prosecution having been launched more than three ' months after the entry was made was barred by limitation under section 42 police act.
39 held, that the appellant was rightly convicted.
whether c was guilty or not, at the time the entry was made there was every likelihood of c being prosecuted, for causing the death of two persons.
the acquittal of c did not affect the finding that the false entry was made with the intention to save or knowing it to be likely to save c from legal punishment.
the acquittal of c under section 218/109 did not exonerate the appellant as it had been found that he had made the false entry with a view to save c. held, further, that the prosecution was not barred by section 42 of the police act.
sections 36 and 42 read together showed that section 42 was applicable only to prosecutions for offences under the police act and not to prosecutions under the penal code or other acts.
