' the industrial court to which the matter was referred for arbitration under section 73 of the bombay industrial relations act, 1946, made an award directing all the respondent mills to pay compensation to the employees.
the mills pleaded that no compensation was payable because (1) the closure of the mills was in pursuance of the directions made by the government under the bombay electricity (special powers) act, 1946, and, therefore, section 11(1) of that act barred the reference, (2) the industrial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim for compensation as the matter was covered by standing orders 16 and 17 which were determinative of the relations between the workmen and their employers under section 40(1) of the bombay industrial relations act, 1946, and (3) in any case, no compensation was payable in view of the decision in muir mills co. ltd. vs suti mills mazdoor union, kanpur, ; held, (1) that section 11 (1) of the bombay electricity (special powers) act, 1946, barred only proceedings arising from the interference with the supply of electric energy and protected those who acted in pursuance of orders passed under that act; the section did not prevent the raising of an industrial dispute.
