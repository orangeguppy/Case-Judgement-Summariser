the appellant was a tenant occupying two rooms in the residential house of respondent no. 2.
he used one room for living purposes and the other as a tailoring shop.
the landlady brought a suit for his eviction on the ground of personal requirement.
but the same was dismissed by the district magistrate.
an appeal to the district judge dehra dun was allowed, and explanation (iv) to section 21(1) of the u.p. urban buildings (regulation of letting, rent and evic tion) act, 1972 was held applicable.
the view was upheld by the high court in petition filed by the appellant who con tended that due to his shop the house under tenancy had ceased to be a residential building and that explanation (iv) was not applicable.
the high court rejected the peti tion.
dismissing the appeal, the court held: explanation (iv) provides a conclusive and irre buttable presumption of bona fide requirement once the conditions mentioned therein are established.
the tests for application of explanation (iv) are as follows: (1) the building should be a residential building; and (2) the landlord must be in occupation of a part of the building for residential purposes, the other part being in the occupation of the tenant.
if the above two tests are fulfilled in a case, there is no need for the landlord to establish any other requirement.
[172f h] (2) the fact that a tailoring shop is run in one of the rooms is not sufficient to convert what otherwise to all intents and purposes is a residential building, into a non residential building.
