in tamil nadu the levy of the sales tax is regulated by the tamil nadu general sales tax act, 1959.
in the year 1970 the state legislature enacted the tamil nadu additional sales tax act, (act xiv of 1970) with effect from may 28, 1970.
the scheme of section 2 of the act was to levy the additional tax by the process of increasing the tax payable under the act of 1959 by 10 percent the said increase representing the quantum of the additional tax.
the proviso to section stipulates for a concessional treatment in respect of the declared goods.
in september, 1971 the state legislature enacted the tamil nadu sales tax (surcharge) act, 1971.
with retrospective effect from june, 1971.
under section 3 of that act every dealer liable to pay tax under the act of 1959 was subjected to a further liability to pay surcharge at the rate of 5 per cent of such tax.
in 1976 the tamil nadu additional sales tax (act ii) of 1976 was passed amending and substituting section 2 of the earlier act providing for graded rates with a super added condition that the additional tax payable cannot be collected from the consumers, a contravention of which would attract penal action.
on receipt of notices of demand issued consequent upon the assessment to additional sales tax under the provisions of the section as amended by the 1976 act the petitioners have come up to the court challenging the constitutional validity of the act, 1976 and seeking to quash the assessment orders and the notices of demand issued to them.
dismissing the writ petitions, the court ^ held: 1 the contentions that the amended section 2 of the tamil nadu additional sales tax act 2 of 1976 is devoid of legislative competence in as much as it imposes not a tax on sales but a tax on income, that the adoption 981 of slab system for determining tax liability is alien to the concept of sales tax that the levy of additional tax under the impugned enactment violates articles 14 and 19 of the constitution and that the provisions of the act are violative of article 301 of the constitution are all totally devoid of merit.

the constitutional validity of the levy of additional tax is not in any manner affected by the change brought about in the mode of levy and as a result of the amendments effected by the impugned act.
the impugned enactment has merely amended the 1970 act.
it has not introduced a new tax; what it has done is only to amend the 1970 act by providing for different method of computation of the additional tax leviable under that act by linking the rate of levy to the taxable turnover instead or to the amount of tax assessed under the act of 1959.
the nature and identity of the additional sales tax imposed by the 1970 act have not been in any way altered by the impugned act.
