the profits of the business were distributed amongst the members of the group in proportion of the capital contributed by them.
the income tax officer issued notice under section 22(4) of the indian income tax act, and on production of books of account assessed the respondent as an "association of persons".

member of the group, the group is an "association of persons" and it makes no difference that the scheme which produced profits was at the instance of or under the control of the deputy commissioner or that he had appointed the members constituting the group.
