the two appellants, who were the managing director and the production manager of a public limited company, were prosecuted by the respondent for alleged violations by their company of clauses 2 (c) (i) and 3 of the madhya pradesh pulses, edible oil seeds and edible oil dealers licensing order, 1977 and clause 3 of the madhya pradesh essential commodities (price exhibition and price control) order, 1977 read with sections 3 and 7 of the essential commodities act (the act, for short).
the appellants moved the high court under sections 397 and 482 of the code of criminal procedure to quash the proceedings against them on the ground that they could not, in law, be prosecuted unless the company itself was prosecuted.
the high court over ruled this contention and hence these appeals by special leave.

section 10 of the act lists the persons who may be held guilty and punished when it is a company that contravenes an order made under section 3 of the act.

[722c f] 2.
it is clear from the language of section 10 that there is no statutory compulsion that the person in charge or an officer of the company may not be prosecuted unless he be ranged alongside the company itself.
each or any of them may be separately prosecuted or along with the company if there is a contravention of an order made under section 3 of the act by the company.
