the 39 petitioners in the writ petition were promotees to the post of assistant in the indian council of agricultural research first respondent.
the nos. 3 second respondent was the union of india and respondent nos. 3 to 31 were direct recruits to the same post.
respondent nos. 32 to 88 were also promotees and impleaded as proforma respondents.
the petitioners contended that they belonged to the service of the central secretariat, (department of agriculture) and the society was a part of that department till 1.4.1965 on which date the government of india decided to re organise the society into a fully autonomous organisation with its own secretariat.
the petitioners opted to join the service in the society on such re organisation.
respondent nos. 3 to 31 were directly recruited after an open competitive test.
the seniority list was prepared by the society in 1976 showing the relative positions of the promotees and the direct recruits.
a second seniority list was published by the society on 7.4.1981 and this list brought changes in the earlier list and pushed down the promotees from the positions they occupied in that list.
the petitioners contended that this seniority list should be quashed on the ground that it violated article 14 and 16 of the constitution, as recruitment rules laying down the terms of services in the society were not available seniority had to be fixed on length of service.
they were also entitled to seniority on the basis of the length of their service from the date of they came into the society by virtue of the option.
the case of the contesting respondents was that seniority has to be fixed not with reference to tho reorganisation of the society but on the date of their appointment on a regular basis, and that the petitioners had to establish that they were duly appointed in the service on a regular basis when they exercised their option.
dismissing the writ petition.
1065 ^ held: 1.
in the absence of satisfactory proof of the date of appointment of the petitioners in the grade as assistants in the society the petitioners cannot successfully urge violation of article 14 and 16 of the constitution.
no great injustice was done to the promotees in the preparation of the list.
goeing through the list, one finds that the gap between the promotees and the direct recruits is of a very short duration and not wide as in other cases.
direct recruitment was made first only 1967.
however, to work out the quota system an earlier date of appointment had to be given to the direct recruits.
this could not be avoided.
this has not done great injustice to the petitioners.
this dislocation was limited only to a period between 1965 to 1967 and 1967 to 1971 and not a fairly long period of time.
[1073 c e] 2.
the memorandum annexure 4 dated 20th april, 1970 clearly states that the principles to determine the inter sc seniority of the ministerial staff in the reorganised council was considered by the society and that it was decided that the seniority of the ministerial staff would be fixed on the basis of "date of appointment made on a regular basis.
" the contention of the petitioners that seniority has to be filed with reference to the date on which option was exercised by them, has no basis.
[1069d.e] 3.
direct recruitment to the post of assistants in the society was made holding competitive examination in 1967 and 1971.
upper division clerks, like the petitioners who were working with the agricultural department, could very well have appeared for this competitive examination and got themselves directly recruited as assistants on successfully passing the competitive examination.
some of the petitioners in fact appeared for the competitive test without success.
those who were successful at the competitive examination and the interview were offered the post of assistant by regular appointment.

relying on annexure 4 memorandum dated 24.4.70 the petitioners ' attempt to contend that their seniority should start from the date they exercised option and that this is correctly reflected in 1976 list.
this submission overlooks the fact that even at that time, there were rules in existence prescribing a ratio of 1: i between promotees and direct recruits.
in addition to this, it has to be noted that here also, filling up of vacancies on a regular basis is emphasised, [1071 g h] 5.
the union government and the society were originally in error in their assumption that no rules existed for regulating the service conditions in the society annexure 6, are rules relating to the indian council of agricultural research before its reorganisation.
the said rules show, that the posts of assistants can be filled up 50% by direct recruit also.
the handbook for personnel officer shows that the relative seniority of direct recruits and promotees shall be determined according to the rotation of vacancies between direct recruits and promotees which shall based on the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct recruitment and promotion respectively in the recruitment rules.
new recruitment rules came into effect from 1.91974.
this method of recruitment was to be with effect from 1.1.1976.
it further provided that vacancies arising between 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975 were to be filled wholly (100%) by promotion this 1066 means that vacancies prior to 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975 will be filled up in accordance with the 1964 rules and vacancies between 29.8.1973 and 31.12 1975 will be filled by the promotees along and thereafter in the ratio 1: 1.
from these rules it is evident that the society was conscious of the claims of the promotees and hence safeguards their interests by providing 100% posts for them between 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975.
by doing so, justice was done to them in a great measure.
