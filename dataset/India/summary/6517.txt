the no objection certificate granted to respondent no. 1 corporation under rule 144 of the petroleum rules 1976 for running a petrol pump set up by it on a lease hold site was cancelled by respondent no. 5, the district magistrate under rule 151 of the rules.
this order was upheld by the commis sioner, but was set aside by the high court, on appeal.
hence the special leave petition against the high court 's order.
dismissing the special leave petition, this court, held: the high court was right in holding that the district authority under rule 151 of the petroleum rules, 1976 can cancel the no objection certificate only when the licensee ceases to have any right to use the site for stor ing petrol.
however, certain subsequent observations made by the high court in the judgment might lead to an inference that so long as the licensee continues to have leasehold rights on the site, the 'no objection certificate ' cannot be cancelled at all.
that is not the correct position in law.
[738b c] on a reading of sub rule (1) of the rule 151 it is clear that a 'no objection certificate ' granted under rule 144 can be cancelled wherever the licensee ceases to have any right to use the site for storing petrol and that right could be lost by a licensee either by his tenancy or right to the use of the site coming to an end or for any other reason where by, in law, the right to use the site for storing petrol ceases.
