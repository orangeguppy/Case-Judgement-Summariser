the respondents were inducted as sub lessees in contravention of 'section 73 of the revenue administration and ryotwari land revenue and tenancy act, 1950.
on the question whether they acquired rights as occupancy tenants under section 185 (1) (ii) (b) of the madhya pradesh land revenue code.
held : a person inducted as a sub lessee, but who by express provision contained in section 73 read with section 78 of act 66 of 1950 is declared a trespasser, does not acquire the states of an occupancy tenant under section 185(1)(ii)(b) of the madhya pradesh land revenue code.
act 29 of 1955 conferred protection only upon a ryatwari sub lessee, and a ryotwari sub lessee was defined in that act as meaning a person in whose favour the land was settled.
a person, the lease in whose favour was declared void by virtue of act 66 of 1950, could not claim the status of a. sub lessee.
that is so enacted in section 3 which excludes from the protection granted by act 29 of 1955, amongst others, a sub lessee deemed to be a trespasser under section 78 of act 66 of 1950.
a person inducted as a sub lessee contrary to the provisions of section 73 of act 66 of 1950 did not, therefore, acquire any right under a contract of sub letting, and his possession was not protected under act 29 of 1955.
such a person is not a ryotwari sub lessee defined in the madhya bharat ryotwari sub lesse protection act 29 of 1955, and it is only on 'ryotwari sub lessee ' as defined in that act that the right of occupancy tenants conferred by section 185(1)(ii)(b) of the madhya pradesh land revenue code.
