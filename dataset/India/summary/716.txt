sanction was given under section 6 of the prevention of corruption act, 1947, for the prosecution of the appellant for having received illegal gratification from one pal singh.
he was charged with and tried for two offences under section 5(1)(a) of the act for habitually accepting or obtaining illegal gratification and under section 5(1)(d) for receiving illegal gratification from pal singh.
the special judge found both charges proved and convicted the appellant.
on appeal, the high court held that the appellant could neither be tried nor convicted of the offence under section 5(1)(a) as no sanction had been given in respect of it but upheld the conviction for the offence under section 5(1)(d) for which sanction had been given.
it was argued that the conviction even for the offence under section 5(1)(d) was illegal as the trial was wholly void and without jurisdiction : held, that the contention that the trial for two offences requiring sanction is wholly void, where the sanction is granted for only one offence and not for the other, is unsustainable.
the want of sanction for the offence of habitually accepting bribes does not make the taking of cognizance of the offence of taking a bribe from pal singh void nor the trial for that offence illegal and the court a court without jurisdiction.
