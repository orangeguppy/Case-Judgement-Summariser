the respondent challenged the notice for reasessment issued under section 147(b) of the income tax act, 1961 for the assessment year 1965 66.
the high court quashed the notice holding that the action of the income tax officer was barred by limitation prescribed by the act.
allowing the appeal of the revenue, held: 1.
the scheme of the 1961 act so tar as notice for reassessment is concerned is quite different.
what used to be contained in section 34 of the 1922 act has been spread out into three sections, being sections 147.
148 and 149 of the 1961 act.
a clear distinction has been made out between "issue of notice" and "service of notice" under the 1961 act.
section 149 prescribes the period of limitation.
it categor ically prescribes that no notice under section 148 shall be issued after the prescribed limitation has lapsed.
section 148(1) provides for service of notice as a condition prece dent to making the order of assessment.
once a notice is issued within the period of limitations, jurisdiction be comes vested in the income tax officer to proceed to reas sess.
the mandate of section 148(1) is that reassessment shall not be made until there has been service.
the requirement of issue of notice is satisfied when a notice is actually issued.

in the instant case, notice was issued within the prescribed period 43 of limitation as march 31, 1970 was the last day of that period.
service under the new act is not a condition prece dent to conferment of jurisdiction in the income tax officer to deal with the matter but it is a condition precedent to making of the order of assessment.
the high court lost sight of the distinction and under a wrong basis felt bound by the judgment in banarsi debi & anr.
t. 0., district iv, calcutta & ors., ( as the income tax officer had issued notice within limitation the order of the high court is vacated.
