the only question that a civil court is precluded from determining under section 9(2) of the , read with r. 30 of the rules framed under the act is the question as to whether, when or how any person has acquired the citizenship of another country.
they are not prevented from determining other questions concerning the nationality of a person.
where, therefore, a suit brought for a declaration that the appellants were indian citizens, where they themselves had raised the question of acquisition of foreign citizenship, was resisted on the ground that they had never been indian citizens, and the courts below dismissed the suit in its entirety, held, that the courts below were in error in holding that the suit was barred in its entirety by section 9(2) of the act.
they should have decided the question as to whether the appellants had ever been citizens of india and, if the finding was in their favour, should have stayed the suit till the central government had decided whether such citizenship was renounced and if the finding was against the appellants dismissed the suit.
