the respondent company was incorporated in the former state of travancore.
the dispute was about the right of the respondent assessee company to carry forward the loss of the years 1946 under the provisions of the travancore act read with section 24 (2) of the indian income tax act and the taxation laws (part b states)(removal of difficulties) order, 1950, to the assessment year 1951 52 in the assessment of the company for its year of account.
the income tax officer held that the loss of the year 1946 could not be carried forward to that year, since it had lapsed after two years under section 32 of the travancore act and section 24 (2) was not applicable, in view of para 3 of the order. ^ held, that the taxation laws (part b state) (removal of difficulties) order, 1950, passed under section 12 of the indian 606 finance act, 1950, was not intended to make a dividing line between those previous years to which the provisions of the earlier law would apply, and those previous years to which the provisions of the income tax act would apply.
the rights were neither enlarged or curtailed by para 3 of the order.
that paragraph said that the right was available in the same manner, to the same extent and upto the same year of assessment as laid down in the state law.
the law to apply was thus the state law and the carry forward could only be for two years.
