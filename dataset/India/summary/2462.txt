under section 297(2)(d)(ii) of the income tax act, 1961.
dealing with repeals and savings, notwithstanding the repeal of the 1922 act, where in respect of any assessment year after the year ending on 31st day of march, 1940, any income had escaped assessment and no proceedings under section 34 of the repealed act are pending at the commencement of the 1961 act, a notice under section 148 of the 1961 act may be issued for reopening the assessment.
the respondent was assessed to income tax for the assessment year 1947 48.
thereafter the income tax officer issued a notice under section 34(1)(a) of the income tax act, 1922, for reassessment.
there was no proper service of the notice, and despite the respondent 's objection, the income tax officer determined the total income of the respondent at rs. 89,000.
the appellate assistant commissioner allowed the respondent 's appeal by order dated 5th january, 1963 on the ground that there is no valid service of the notice.
on 1st april, 1962 the1922 act was repealed and the income tax act.
1961 came into force, and the time for taking action for reassessment was enlarged.
from 8 years to 16 years.
by that date, the right of the income tax officer to reopen the assessment under section 34(1)(a) of the 1922 act became barred.
the income tax officer however, issued a notice under section 148 of the 1961 act for reopening the assessment.
the respondent, thereupon filed a writ petitioning the high court for quashing the notice and the petition was allowed.
in appeal to this court.
held: on a proper construction of section 297(2)(d)(ii) the income tax officer cannot issue a notice under section 148 in order to reopen the assessment of an assessee in a case where the right to reopen the assessment under the 1922 act was barred at the date when the 1961 act came into force.
the reason is that unless the statute expressly so provides or there is a necessary implication, retrospective operation should not be given to it so as to affect, alter or destroy any right already acquired or to revive any remedy ' already lost by effluviums of time.
the 1961 act does not disclose in express terms or by necessary implication that there was a revival of the right of the income tax officer to reopen an assessment which was already barred under the 1922 act and if the section is construed as reviving such a right it would be tantamount to giving it retrospective operation which is not warranted by its language.
the words 'where in respect of any assessment year after the year ending on 31st day of march, 1940, ' in the section, cannot take in their sweep all assessment years subsequent to the year ending on 31st march, 1940 without regard 715 to the question whether the fight to reopen the assessment in respect of any assessment year was or was not barred under the repealed act.
the section must he read as applicable only to those cases where the right of the income tax officer to reopen the assessment was not barred under the repealed section.
