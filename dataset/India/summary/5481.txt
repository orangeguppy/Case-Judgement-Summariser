indore, ; and krishnadas bhatija vs a.s. venkatachala shetty, (slp no. 913 of 1978 decided on 13th feb., 1978) held that the fact that the order of the district judge under section so(2) of the karnataka rent control act, 1961 is made final, does not affect the jurisdiction of the high court under section 115 of the code of civil procedure to revise such orders of the district judge, in the absence of any express words in the statute taking away such jurisdiction.
later this court, in vishesh kumar vs shanti prasad, ; while interpreting section 25 of the provincial small causes courts act, as amended by the u.p. amendment act, 1978, under which the revisional jurisdiction was shared between the district court and the high court, took the view that the high court was not vested with revisional jurisdiction under section 115 cpc in respect of a revisional order made by the district court under that section.
a similar view was also 341 taken in aundal ammal vs sadasivan pillai, ; while construing section 20 of the kerala buildings (lease and rent control) act, 1965 .

ilr approved.
m.m. yaragatti vs vasant, ilr overruled.
the decision of a full bench of the high court consisting of three judges rendered in krishnaji 's case was binding on a bench of equal strength unless that decision had directly been overruled by this court or by necessary implication became unsustainable.
there is no such overruling of krishnaji 's decision by this court.
it cannot also be said that by necessary implication the ratio therein supported by the direct authority of this court stood superseded.

judicial propriety warrants that decisions of the supreme 342 court must be taken wholly binding on the high courts.
that is the necessary outcome of the tier system.
article 141 of the costitution unequivocally states that the law declared by this court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of india.
