in 1946, the bombay tenancy act, 1939 was applied to the respondent muncipality.
section 3a of the act provided that every tenant shall, on the expiry of one year from the date of the coming into force of the amendment act of 1946, be deemed to be a protected tenant, unless the landlord had within that period, applied to the mamlatdar for a declaration that the tenant was not protected.
the appellant had taken on lease lands from the respondent, and since the respondents had not applied lo the mamltdar, the appellant became a protected tenant. 'me 1939 act was repealed by the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act, 1948, section 31 of the 1948 act provided that a person shall be recognised to be a protected tenant, if such person had been deemed to be a protected tenant under section 3, 3a or 4 of the 1939 act.
but section 88 of the same act provided that nothing in the foregoing provisions of the 1948 act shall apply to lands held on lease from a local authority, while section 89(2) provided for the repeal of the 1939 act except for sections 3, 3a and 4 which continued, is modified in schedule 1 of the 1948 act, and also provided.
that nothing in the 1948 act, or any repeal effected thereby shall save as expressly provided in the 1948 act, affect or be deemed to affect any right, title, interest, obligation or liability, acquired, accrued or incurred before the commencement of the 1948 act.
in 1955 the respondent gave notice to the appellant terminating his tenancy and subsequently filed a suit for possession.
pending proceedings arising from the suit, the appellant applied to the mamlatdar for a declaration that he was a protected tenant of the lads, and the mamlatdar gave the declaration.
on appeal, the collector held that the mamlatdar had no jurisdiction to decide the question.
the bombay revenue tribunal, in revision, set aside the collector 's order, and the high court, in application under article 227, restored collector 's order.
in his appeal to this court , the appellant contended that (i) the interest acquired by him as a protected tenant under the 1939 act would not be affected in view of the provisions of section 89(2) in the 1948 act; and (ii) the mamlatdar had jurisdiction to decide the question under section 88b.
held : (i) the plain effect of the provisions contained in sections 31, 88 and 89(2) (b), is that, in view of the express provision contained in section 88 (1) (a).
the appellant could not claim the benefit of section 31, nor could it be said that his interest as protected tenant was saved by section 89(2) (b), [625 g] sections 3, 3a and 4 of the 1939 act were continued in a modified form in schedule 1 of the 1949 act only for the purpose of a. 11 of the 1948 act and a perusal of those shows that protected tenants were only those tenants who satisfied these three sections and that no 619 new protected tenants could come into existence under the 1948 act as & 31 is one of the foregoing provisions referred to in section 88, it win not apply to lands held on lease from a local authority.
in effect, therfore, legislature, which had conferred by the 1939 act, the status of a protected tenant on certain persons, took away that status by enacting section 88 in the 1948 act so far as lessees from a local authority were concerned.
as far as section 89(2)(b) is concerned, that part of it which says that any repeal effected thereby shall not affect or be deemed to affect any right etc., will not help the appellant because sections 3, 3a and 4 of the 1939 act were not repealed by the 1948 act.
nor will the clause "nothing in this act, shall affect or be deemed to affect" apply, if there is an express provision in the 1948 act which takes away the interest of a protected tenant acquired before its commencement, because of the qualifying words, "save as expressly provided in this act", in the section.
section 88, of the 1948 act is such an express provision which takes out leases from a local authority from the purview of sections 1 of 87 of the 1948 act, including section 31 which is the only provision in the 1948 act which recognised protected tenants.
it follows that there can be no protected tenants of lands held on lease from a local authority under the 1948 act.
it is true that section 88 does not in so many words say that the interest of a protected tenant acquired under the 1939 act is being taken away so far as lands held on lease from a local authority are concerned; but in effect, section 88(1)(a) must be held to say that there will be no protection under the 1948 act for protected tenants under the 1939 act, so far as lands held on lease from a local authority are concerned.
the intention from the express words of section 88(1) (a) is also the same.
it may very well be that the legislature thought that the status of a protected tenant should not be given to lessees of lands from a local authority, in the interest of the general public, and therefore, took away that status which was conferred by the 1939 act.
by the express enactment of section 88(1)(a).
[622 f g; 623 e g; 624 f g; 625 b f; 616 c] further the appellant could not claim the benefit of section 4a, which takes the place of section 31 after the amendment of 1956, and claim that he is a protected tenant, because, section 4a also does not apply to a case of lands held on lease from a local authority.

(ii) section 88b will not protect the appellant, for his lease had already been determined before the section came into force on 1st april 1956 [627 c d]
