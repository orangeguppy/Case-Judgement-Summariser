after taking cognizance of an offence against the respondent the magistrate enquired into it and submitted a report to the sub divisional magistrate that a prima facie case was made out against the respondents.
the sub divisional magistrate directed the issue of process.
the high court in a petition to quash the issue of process hold that under section 204, the sub divisional magistrate had no right to issue process since he was not the magistrate who had taken cognizance of the offence, and also observed that the evidence in the case came from tainted sources.
dismissing the appeal to this court, held: (1) under section 204, cr.
p.c. the magistrate who takes cognizance could issue process and under section 202, cr. p.c., a magistrate to whom a case had been transferred could issue process.
since, in the present case, the magistrate who issued process had not taken cognizance of the offence and there was no order transferring the case to him, the high court was right in quashing the issue of process.
[673 c f] (2) under section 561a, cr.
p.c., the high court could go into the question as to whether there was any legal evidence.
