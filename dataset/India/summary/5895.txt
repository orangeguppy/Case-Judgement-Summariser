(2) the expression `food products ' is not defined in the act.
the exemption includes food products and food preparations ' and provides an inclusive definition of `food products ' and food preparations '.
[946e] (3) the words used in the provision, imposing taxes or granting exemptions, should be understood in the same way in which these are understood in ordinary parlance in the area in which the law is in force or by the people who ordinarily deal with them.
[947f] (4) it is a well settled principle of interpretation that courts in construing a statute or notification will give much weight to the interpretation put upon it at the time of enactment or issue, and since by those who have to construe, execute and apply the said enactments.

after all, the purpose of exemption is to help production of food and food preparations at cheaper price and also help production of items which are in common use and need, like electric light and power.
[949a b] pg no 936 (11) having regard to the language used it would not be in consonance with the spirit and the reason of law to give exemption for non alcoholic beverage bases under the notification.
bearing the aforesaid purpose, it cannot be contended that expensive items like gold spot base, limca base or thumps up base were intended to be given exemption at the cost of the public exchequer.[949e f] (12) non alcoholic beverage bases in india cannot be treated or understood as new 'nutritive material absorbed or taken into the body of an organism which serves for the purpose of growth, work or repair and for the maintenance of the vital process ' and an average indian will not treat non alcoholic beverage bases as food products or food preparations in that light.[948g h]
