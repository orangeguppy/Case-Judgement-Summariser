the appellant assessee is a firm carrying on business of manufacturing ice and preservation of potatoes in its cold storage.
by an assessment order dated july 5, 1961 it was assessed to income tax for the assessment year 1961 62 on a total income of rs. 53,548/ .
the income tax officer, in his proceedings started on december 21, 1961 under section 34(1) of the 1922 act, found certain property income and income to the extent of one lakh from potato transaction put through in the name of benami persons by the assessee had escaped assessment and therefore, by his order dated december 22, 1965 he brought them to tax.
the said order of the income tax officer was annulled in appeal, on may 10, 1967 on the ground that the initiation of reassessment was not justified.
this order became final as the department did not take further steps.
on july 14, 1967 the income tax officer issued a notice under section 148 of the income tax act, 1961 in respect of the self same assessment year after obtaining the sanction of the commissioner of income tax.
pursuant to the notice the appellant filed a return under protest on august 14, 1967.
the appellant challenged the said notice by filing a writ petition in the allahabad high court, inter alia on the ground that under section 297(2)(d)(ii) of the 1961 act no reassessment proceedings could be undertaken under section 147 of the 1961 act inasmuch as in respect of the self same escaped income, proceed ings under section 34(1) of the 1922 act had been undertaken and were pending on april 1, 1962 when the 1961 act came into force.
the high court rejected the contention on the ground that in order that section 297(2)(d)(ii) should apply, proceedings under section 34 of the 1922 act must be legal proceedings with jurisdiction.
allowing the appeal by certificate, the court ^ held : the factual pendency of the proceedings under section 34 of the 1922 act on the relevant date, and not their legality is material for purposes of section 297(2)(d)(ii) of the 1961 act.
[238 d e] in the instant case: (a) admittedly proceedings under section 34(1) of the 1922 act in respect of the item of rupees one lakh (which was said to have escaped assessment) were factually pending on april 1, 1962 and therefore, the notice under section 148 of the 1961 act would be incompetent, and [239 c d] 237 (b) the initiation of the proceedings under section 34 by the income tax officer cannot be regarded as being without jurisdiction and hence non est.
the reassessment order made by the income tax officer on december 22, 1965 clearly shows that he had initiated the proceedings (in respect of property income) under section 34(1) (b) i.e., in consequence of information gathered by him from assistant appellate commissioner 's order for earlier year and not under section 34(1)(a).
