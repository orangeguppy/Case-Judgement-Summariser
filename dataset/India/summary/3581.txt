four persons were tried by the sessions court for of fences punishable under section 302 read with section 34 i.p.c. and section 135 of the bombay police act.
two of the accused were acquitted by the sessions court and one by the high court, having been given the benefit of doubt of identity.
the appellant contended before this court that there was no specific evidence of his having inflicted the fatal stab, and also that since three out of the four accused were acquitted the invocation of section 34 was impermissible.
the findings on the reliability of evidence were also ques tioned.
dismissing the appeal, the court held: (1) when a murderous assault by many bands with many knives has ended fatally, it is legally impermissible to dissect the serious ones from the others and seek to salvage those whose stabs have not proved fatal.
the cir cumstance that one man 's stab fails on a less or more vul nerable part of the person of the victim is of no conse quence to fix the guilt for murder.
section 34 i.p.c. fixes constructive liability in case of community of intent cou pled with participatory presence or operation, and even if some of several accused are acquitted but the participating presence of a plurality of assailants is proved, the con joint culpability for the crime is inescapable.
