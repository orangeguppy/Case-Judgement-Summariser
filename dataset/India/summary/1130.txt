the rule of blending in hindu law as evolved by judicial decisions can have no application to a property held by a hindu female as a limited owner.
that rule postulates a coparcener deliberately and intentionally throwing his independently acquired property into the joint family stock so as to form a part of it.
although it is unnecessary now to investigate whether there is any other text on which that rule could be founded, it is quite clear that the text of yagnavalkya in a different context and the commentary thereupon by vijnyaneshwara, relied on by the privy council in this connection, can have no relation to the said rule.
shiba prasad singh vs rani prayag kumari debi (1932) l.r. 59 i.a. 331, disapproved.
rajanikanta pal vs jaga mohan pal (1923) l.r. 50 i.a. 173, relied on.
consequently, where in a partition suit certain immovable properties acquired by a hindu female from her father as a limited owner were claimed to form part of the joint family property of her husband by virtue of the said rule: held, that the claim must fail.
held, further, that a hindu female owning a limited estate cannot circumvent the rules of surrender and allow the members of her husband 's family to treat her limited estate as part of the joint family property of her husband.
before the said rule can be invoked, it must be shown that the owner wanted to extinguish his title to the property in question and impress upon it the character of joint family property.
