the high court of allahabad held that as the applications contained allegations which might interfere with the course of the trial of the proceedings under section 145, in transmitting the applications the appellants had acted without due circumspection and thought though they had no intention to influence the sub divisional magistrate and the appellants were therefore guilty of contempt of court: held, (i) that in transmitting the applications received by them to the sub divisional magistrate and calling for a report the appellants were not in any way interfering with the course of justice but were only doing their duty as superior officers; (ii) it was not possible to hold that any prejudice had been caused by the two applications being sent by the appellants to the sub,divisional magistrate or that any action was necessary to protect the sub divisional magistrate who was hearing the case and the appellants were not guilty of any contempt of court.
