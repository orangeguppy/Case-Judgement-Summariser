the appellants filed a suit in the court of a subordinate judge.
at the instance of respondent no. 1 (who was the defendant in the suit) an issue as to the jurisdiction of the court to try the suit was framed.
holding that it had no jurisdiction to try the suit the civil court returned the plaint to the appellants for being presented to the proper revenue court.
the revenue court, on presentation of a petition by appellants, held that it had no jurisdiction to try it.
thereupon the appellants again filed a suit in the court of subordinate judge.
the suit failed on the ground of res judicata.
on appeal the high court upheld the view of the civil court.
on the question whether the decision of the subordinate judge on the preliminary issue operated as res judicata.
dismissing the appeal, ^ held: if in a case, the defendant does not appear and the court, on its own, returns the plaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the order in a subsequent suit may not operate as res judicata; but if the defendant appears and an issue is raised and decided then the decision on the question of jurisdiction will operate as res judicata in a subsequent suit although the reasons for its decision may not be so.
[124g] in the instant case, in the first suit the appellants ought to have consisted that the suit was triable by civil court, or, they should have taken the matter before a higher court in the revenue proceeding.
the appellants did neither.
the revenue court had no jurisdiction to go behind the decision of the civil court.
