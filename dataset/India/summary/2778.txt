the high court dismissed their appeals.

(ii) the did not apply to the place of occurrence and therefore the inspectors were not officers of customs who could invoke the authority of the to arrest and seize the appellant nazir mian; (iii) the seizure of cloves was not authorised by section 178 of the nor was the arrest authorised under section 173 of he ; (iv) section 178a of the could not apply because there was no notification to attract the application of the said section.

to accede to the contention on behalf of the appellants that only section 19 of the will apply and no other provisions of the will be effective or operative will be not only to render the words "and all the provisions of that act shall have effect" otiose but also nugatory.
when the statute enacts that all the provisions of that act shall have effect accordingly, it will be an error to hold in spite of the language of such legislation that the provisions of the sea customs act shall not have effect.
the effect of bringing into an act, the provisions of an earlier act is to introduce the incorporated sections of the earlier act into the subsequent act as if these provisions have been enacted in it for the.
first time.
