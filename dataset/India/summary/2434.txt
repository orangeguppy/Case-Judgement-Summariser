the appellant claimed that certain property comprised in an inam which was abolished by virtue of the andhra inams (abolition & conversion into ryotwari) act 36 of 1956 should be registered in his name.
his contention was that prior to its abolition he was the inamdar of that inam though he had the liability to repair a tank in his village from out of the income of inam was granted for a charitable purpose, the object of assuming the inam was granted for a charitable purpose, the.
object of the charity being a tank, the same could not be considered a charitable institution.
held: (i) it was clear from the evidence that the inam was granted in favour of the tank and was not a grant in favour of the appellant 's family subject to the liability to 'repair the tank; and furthermore that the ancestors of the appellant and subsequently the appellant were looking after the management of the tank.
(ii) under hindu law a tank can be an object of charity and when a dedication is made in favour of a tank, it is considered as a charitable institution.
once it was held that the inam in the present case was in favour of the tank, the tank in question must be considered a charitable institution within the meaning of section 2(e) of the act.
consequently, after the abolition 'of the inam, the inam property is converted into ryotwari property of the tank, to be managed by its manager.
admittedly the appellant was the present manager and hence the property in question must be registered in the name of the tank but would ' continue to be managed by the appellant so long as he continued to be its manager.
