while the matter regarding the unnatural death of the daughter in law at the house of her father in law was still under investigation the high court grunted anticipatory bail to the accused in disregard of the magnitude and seriousness of the matter.
subsequent to the filing of the appeal by special leave by the father of the deceased the investigation had been concluded by the police and challan filed, and the accused were released on bail by the chief judicial magistrate.
dismissing the appeal as infructuous, the court, held: the high court was under no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipatory bail in a matter of this nature.
[980d] the appropriate course to adopt was to allow the con cerned magistrate to deal with the case on the basis of the material before him at the point of time of accused 's arrest in case they were arrested.
it was, therefore, neither prudent nor proper for the high court to have granted antic ipatory bail which order was very likely to occasion preju dice by its very nature and timing.
