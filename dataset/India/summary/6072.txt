the respondents who were the accountable persons filed returns under the , and an assessment was made by the deputy controller of estate duty appellant on 26th february.
the estate duty (amendment) act, 1958 repealed the original sections 56 to 65.
section 59 which substituted for the original section 62 made provision for re assessment.
it came into force with effect from 1st july, 1960.
on 21st february, 1962, a notice under the new section 59 of the act was issued to the respondents for re opening the assessment on the ground that some property had escaped the levy of estate duty.
the respondents raised objections but the same were rejected by the assistant controller who reopened the assessment.
against the aforesaid order three different appeals were filed by the respondents before the appellate controller, who allowed the appeals.
set aside the reassessment order holding that section 59 under which action had been taken by the assistant controller was not retrospective in operation.
on appeal by the revenue, the tribunal upheld the view of the appellate controller relying on the decision of the bombay high court in a.n. mafatlal vs deputy controller of estate duty, thereafter.
at the instance of the revenue 3 references were made 988 to the high court raising the indentical question whether section 59 was retrospective in operation and reopening of the assessment under section 59 was bad.
the high court analysed the provisions of the new section 59 and the old section 62.
came to the conclusion that the power of reas sessment conferred by the new section 59 is quite different from the power conferred by the old section 62.
and answered the question in each case in favour of the assessee.
the revenue appealed to this court.
on the question: whether the newly enacted section 59 of the is retrospective in operation so as to affect the assessment already completed on the accountable persons.
dismissing the appeals, the court held: 1.
section 59 of the is not retro spective in operation and reopening of the assessment under section 59 of the act in the instant case is bad in law.
[993d] 2.
the estate duty (amendment) act.
1958 effected a substantial change in the parent act.
sections 56 to 65 were substituted in place of the existing sections 56 to 65.
and the originally enacted section 62 was repealed.
the original section 62 provided essentially for the rectification of mistakes apparent from the record or in the valuation of any property or by reason of the omission of any property.
[992d e] 3.
the newly enacted section 59 deals with properly escaping assessment.
the provision is analogous to section 34 of the indian income tax act.
1922 and section 147 of the income tax act.
the new section 59 endeavours to cover a substantially different area from that treated by the old section 62.
the only area which seems common to the two provisions relates to the "omission of any property", but the incidents of the power under section 62 relate to a situation materially different from the incidents of the power contemplated under section 59.
[992e f] 4.
there are no specific words which confer retrospec tive effect to section 59 as it stands.
to spell out retro spectivity in section 59 there must be something in the intent to section 59 from which retrospective operation can be necessarily inferred.
there is no such intent.
[992g h] 5.
the new section 59 is altogether different from the old section 989 62 and there is nothing new in the new section 59 from which an intent to give retrospective effect to it can be conclud ed.
[992h; 993a] 6.
there is a well settled principle against interfer ence with vested right by subsequent legislation unless the legislation has been made retrospective expressly or by necessary implication.
if an assessment has already been made and completed, the assessee cannot be subjected to re assessment unless the statute permits that to be done.
[993b c] 7.
the new section 59 came into force from 1st july, 1960.
much earlier, on 26th february, 1960.
the assessment on the accountable persons in the instant case had already been completed.
there can be no question of reopening the assessment.
