in respect of a decree passed against t, who was the owner of certain watan properties, a building standing on watan land comprised in the said properties, was sought to be attached and sold in execution of the decree.
the appellant, who was the legal representative of t, claimed that the building:was not liable for attachment and sale because (1) the building, being part of watan property within the meaning of section 4 of the bombay hereditary offices act, 1874, was not saleable property under sub section

(c) of the proviso to sub section
(i) of section 60 of the code.
the facts showed that the building was not in existence when the watan was first created but had been built subsequently by one of the watandars and there was no indication on the record that the building was constructed for the purpose of providing remuneration for the performance of the duty appertaining to a hereditary office.
the evidence also showed that the appellant was not entirely dependent for his livelihood upon the income from the home farm, that he had substantial income from other lands and that there was nothing to show that this income derived from his other lands was the result of cultivation by him.
held, that the building in question was not an accession to the land so as to partake of the character of the land on which it was constructed and did not come within the definition of watan property in section 4 of ' the bombay hereditary offices act, 1874.

(1) of section 60 of the code an agriculturist is any person who occupies himself with agriculture.
