the punjab high court has jurisdiction to issue a writ under article 226 of the constitution to the income tax investigation commission located in delhi and investigating the case of the petitioner under 5 of the taxation on income (investigation commission) act, 1947, although the petitioners were assessees within the u.p. state and their original assessments were made by the income tax authorities of that state.
article 226 of the constitution confers on all the high courts new and very wide powers in the matter of issuing writs which they never possessed before.
there are only two limitations placed upon the exercise of such powers by a high court; one is that the power is to be exercised "throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction", that is to say, the writs issued by the court cannot run beyond the territories subject to its jurisdiction.
the other is that the person or authority to whom 739 the high court is empowered to issue writs "must be within those territories" and this ,implies that they must be amenable to its jurisdiction either by residence or location within those territories.
the remedy provided in article 226 of the constitution is a discretionary one and the high court has always the discretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved party can have an adequate or suitable relief elsewhere.
