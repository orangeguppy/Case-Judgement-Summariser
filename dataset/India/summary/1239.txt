the appellant accepted a sum of rs. 10,000 from a con tractor.
he was chalanned before a magistrate at dhanbad; but on an application by the appellant the high court trans ferred the case to the munsif magistrate, patna.
subsequently, the criminal law amendment act, 1952, came into force which made every offence under section 161 indian penal code and section 5(2) prevention of corruption act triable only by a special judge for the area within which it was committed.
the case of the appellant was forwarded to the special judge at patna who convicted him both under section 161 and section 5(2).
the appellant contended: (1) that the special judge at patna had no jurisdiction to try the appellant as the offence was committed within the area of the special judge at dhanbad and (2) that the provisions regarding the presumption contained in section 4 of the prevention of corruption act, 1947, offended article 21 of the constitution.
held, that the order of conviction could not be quashed on the ground that the special judge at patna had no territorial jurisdiction to try the case as no failure of justice had been occasioned.
section 531 code of criminal procedure was applicable to trials by special judges.
the high court had also the power under section 526 of the code to transfer a case from one special judge to another, and the omission of a formal order transferring the case to the special judge at patna had not prejudiced the appellant.
held, further that the procedure laid down by section 4 of the prevention of corruption act, which was enacted by parlia ment, laid down a procedure established by law.
the question that section 4 offended article 21 of the constitution was not a substantial question as to the interpretation of the constitution within the meaning of article 145(3) and it was not necessary to refer it to a bench of five judges.
