the revenue officer allowed the applications and directed restoration of possession.
the respondent filed a petition under article 226 of the constitution in the high court for quashing the orders of the revenue officer contending, (1) that the application of the provisions of the 1948 act to his private properties violated the guarantee given under the agreement, (2) that article 363 of the constitution barred the court from dealing with any dispute arising out of the agreement, and (3) that the 1948 act did not apply to him as he was not a landlord.
the high court accepted these contentions and quashed the proceedings taken under the 1948 act: held, that the extension of the 1948 act did not affect the full ownership, use and enjoyment of his properties guaranteed to the respondent under the agreement.
the provisions of the agreement only protected his rights to the properties declared to be his private properties so that they could not be claimed at anytime thereafter as state properties.
the guarantee given under the agreement could not be absolute but could only be co extensive with the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property which is guaranteed to all citizens under article 19(1)(f) of the constitution.
