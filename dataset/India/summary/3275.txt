(ii) item no. 10 of the third schedule to the act does not say that all questions arising out of retrenchment of workmen and closure of establishment have to be decided by industrial tribunal.
this entry refers to cases where the right to retrench workers or to lose an establishment is disputed and that question is referred for adjudication to the industrial tribunal.

in the present case the workmen do not ask for reinstatement.
they accept the termination of the services and ask for compensation.

item 10 of third schedule will not cover such a case.
