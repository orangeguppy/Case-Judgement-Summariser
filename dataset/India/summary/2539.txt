the appellant and respondents were contestants for a reserved seat from 'a scheduled caste constituency for election to the state legislative assembly, and the first respondent was elected.
the election was challenged by the appellant on the ground that the respondent was not a member of scheduled caste because, he embraced christianity and professed the christian religion, and therefore, was not eligible to stand for election for the reserved seat.
during the trial, the high court summoned a register, containing the names of all converted christians of the locality, which was maintained by the local church.
there was no entry showing that the first respondent was converted to christianity.
on the issue whether the first respondent was converted to christianity, the high court, on a consideration of the entire evidence held that there were no proof of such conversion and dismissed the petition.
in appeal to this court, a petition was flied alleging that the register contained entries showing that the parents of the first respondent were converted to christianity and it was prayed that the case should proceed on the plea of conversion to christianity of the parents of the first respondent, in place of the original plea that the first respondent himself was so converted.
held: the prayer in the petition could not be granted because: (a) the plea changed the entire nature of t e case and required fresh evidence, (b) it was belated and beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing of election petitions; and (c) the application should have been filed in the high court itself, for, the register was produced in the high court and it was inspected by the parties who had thus ample opportunity to discover the basis for the new plea.

(3) of the constitution (scheduled castes) order, 1950, it would have been sufficient if the appellant pleaded and proved that the first respondent was a christian that therefore he was not a hindu and was not competent to stand for the reserved seat; but he chose to establish that the first respondent was himself converted to christianity and failed to do so.
