the respondent inherited tenancy of the demised premises alongwith his mother, brothers and sisters from their fa ther.
a notice under section 106 of the terminating the tenancy was served on him.
it was followed by a suit for ejectment against him.
upholding the validity of the said notice, the trial court took the view that the heirs of the original tenant held the tenancy as joint tenants and, therefore, notice to one of the defendants was sufficient to determine the tenan cy.
allowing the appeal therefrom, the 'high court took the view that as heirs of the deceased tenant they held the tenancy as tenants incommon and not as joint tenants.
there fore, the notice to quit should have been served on each one of the successor tenants.
allowing the appeal by special leave, the court, held: the notice under section 106 of the transfer of proper ty act served by the appellant on the respondent was a valid notice.
[771e] on the death of the original tenant, subject to any provi sion to the contrary either negativing or limiting the succession, the tenancy rights devolve on the heirs of the deceased tenant.
the incidence of the tenancy are the same as those enjoyed by the original tenant.
it is a single tenancy which devolves on the heirs.
there is no division of the premises or of the rent payable therefor.
the heirs thus succeed to the tenancy as joint tenants.
[771c] in the instant case, the respondent acted on behalf of the tenants, he paid rent on behalf of all and accepted notice also on behalf of all.
in the circumstances, the notice served on the respondent was sufficient.
the suit must, therefore, succeed.
