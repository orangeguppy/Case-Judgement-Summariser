the validity of section 34(1a) of the income tax act was challenged by the assessees as contravening article 14 of the constitution.
it was ,,contended, that the remedy by way of appeals and revisions available in cases under section 34(1) was denied to the assessees against whom proceedings were taken under section 34(1a), and that while under section 34(1)(a), as it then stood, the assessing authority could not act beyond 8 years, this protection was not available to assessees against, whom action was taken under section 34(1a).
827 held: section 34(1a) was valid and did not contravene article 14 of the constitution.
it could not have been the intention of the legislature when it enacted section 34(1a) that the procedure prescribed by the relevant provisions of the act beginning with section 22 should not be applicable to proceedings taken under section 34(1a), and that the procedure to be followed in the said proceedings and the powers to be exercised by the income tax officers dealing with them should be, what is vaguely described as "the inherent or incidental powers" of such officers.
the words "thereupon" and "accordingly" in section 34(1a) seems to emphasise the applicability of the relevant provisions of the act to the proceedings taken under section 34(1a).
the object of the legislature being to catch income which ' had escaped assessment, it would be legitimate for the legislature to deal with the class of assessees in whose cases the income which had escaped assessment was much larger, because that would be a basis for rational classification which has an intelligible connection with the object intended to be achieved by the statute.
