the appellant was the assignee of a mortgage dated 14 12 1911, executed by a, which comprised.
lands belonging to the mortgagor and also a mortgage executed by the respondents in his favour on 19 7 1909.
the appellant instituted a suit in the court of the subordinate judge of kakinada, for the recovery of the amount due on the mortgage, dated 14 12 1911, and prayed for sale of the hypotheca.
the respondents were impleaded as defendants but did not appear.
the suit was decreed ex parte, and in execution of the decree, the properties of the respondents, mortgaged to a on 19 7 1909, were brought to sale, and purchased by the decree holder.
the respondents then instituted the present suit in the district court of east godavari which then bad jurisdiction over the properties in suit, for a declaration that the decree obtained by the appellant was fraudulent and inoperative and could not affect their title.
the plaint was later on amended and a prayer added that the properties might be partitioned and the respondents put in separate possession of their share.
the trial judge dismissed the suit and the district court in appeal affirmed his decision.
before the high court in second appeal it was contended for the first time that the decree in question did not direct a sale of the mortgaged properties but a sale of the mort gagee 's rights under the mortgage deed dated 19 7 1909 and as such the sale of the properties was void.
the high court having called for a finding from the district court as to what was sold, it was 939 found by that court that the decree bad really directed a sale of the mortgagee 's rights and not of the properties mortgaged and that there was excessive execution.
it was, however, of opinion that the point should have been taken before the executing court and the suit in so far as it claimed relief on the basis of excessive execution was barred under section 47 of the code of civil procedure.
the high court declined to entertain the objection that the suit was barred under section 47 as it had not been taken in the written statement and was raised for the first time in second appeal, and decreed the respondent 's suit.
it was contended for the appellant that the high court should have entertained the objection and held that the suit was so barred.
held, that the appellant should be permitted to raise the contention.
the point relating to excessive execution had never been specifically raised except before the high court and the allegations in the plaint were vague and obscure.
it is a pure question of law which requires no further investigation of facts and was understood and debated as such by the parties before the district court.
that it was well settled that the question whether an execution sale was in excess of the decree and, therefore, not warranted by it could be raised as between the parties only by an application under section 47 of the code before the executing court and not by a separate suit.

that the district court of east godavari to whose jurisdiction the properties had been transferred before the present suit was instituted had by reason of such transfer acquired an inherent jurisdiction over them and if it entertained an application for execution with reference to them such action was no more than an irregular assumption of jurisdiction and no objection to jurisdiction having been taken by the appellant at the earliest opportunity he must be deemed to have waived it and, consequently, there was no legal bar to treating the plaint as an execution application under section 47 of the code.
