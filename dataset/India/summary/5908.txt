respondent no. 1, the owner of a public service vehicle, made an application to the regional transport authority for the grant of a `special permit ' under section 63(6) of the motor vehicles act, 1939.
the regional transport authority rejected the said application on the ground that the provisions of the karnataka contract carriages (acquisition) act, 1976 prohibited the grant of such permit.
aggrieved by the aforesaid order of refusal, respondent no. 1 filed a writ petition in the high court and a single judge of the high court allowed writ petition and directed the regional transport authority to consider the application of responded no.1 for the grant of a special permit.
the regional transport authority preferred a writ appeal.
the division bench of the high court taking the view that the intention of the legislature was that only a public service vehicle in relation to which a special permit held been issued when the 1976 act came into force and which was not operating as a stage carriage should be acquired, held that a public service vehicle in relation to which a special permit had not been issued when the act came into force would not come within the definition of `contract carriage under section 3(g) of the act and the prohibition contained in section 20 of the act against the grant of contract carriage permit would not extend to the grant of special pg no 1038 pg no 1039 permit under sub section 6 of section 63 of the .
the division bench dismissed the appeal.
the regional transport authority appealed by special leave to this court.
on the question whether after the coming into force of the karnataka contract carriages (acquisition) act, 1976, a special permit under section 63(6) of the can be granted under the act.
allowing the appeals, held: 1.
section 14 read with section 20(3) of the karnataka contract carriages (acquisition) act, 1976 confers a monopoly on the karnataka state road transport corporation to run vehicles as contract carriages.
[1050a] 2.
section 14 read with section 20(3) of the act clearly prohibits the grant of renewal of any permit for the running of any contract carriage.
[1049c] 3.
the high court was not therefore right in its view that a public service vehicle in relation to which a special permit had not been issued when the act came into force, would not come within the definition of `contract carriage ' in section (g) and the prohibition contained in section 20 of the act against the grant of contract carriage permit cannot extend to grant of special permit under section 63(6) of the .
[1050b c] 4.
under clauses (i) and (ii) of section 3(g) of the act if a special permit under section 63(6) or a temporary permit under section 62(1) or sub section ( i c) of section 68 f of the has been issued, it will came within the purview of the definition of `contract carriage '.
[1046c d] 5.
if a special permit under section 62(1) or under section 63(6) of the was in force on january 30, 1976 in respect of a stage carriage, such a stage carriage will not be a `contract carriage ' within the meaning of section 3(g) of the act.
[1046 d] 6.
whether the expression `has been ' occurring in a provision of a statute denotes transaction prior to the enactment of the statute in question or a transaction after the coming into force of the statute will depend upon the intention of the legislature to be gathered from the provision in which the said expression occurs or from the other provisions of the statute.
[1046h; 1047a] pg no 1040 in the instant case, the words `has been ' contemplate the issuance of a special permit or a temporary permit as preferred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 3(g) of the act after the enactment of the act which is clear from exclusion clause (ii) of section 3(g) which excludes a stage carriage from the definition of `contract carriage ', if special permits issued under section 62(1) or section 63(6) of the were in force on january 30, 1976.
[1049f] 7.
the words `contract carriage ' occurring in section 3(m) must be read in the light of the definition as contained in section 3(g) of the act.
so read, it is manifest that section 14 read with section 20(3) of the act clearly bars the making of any application for a permit or for renewal of an existing permit for the running of a vehicle, whether a contract carriage or a stage carriage, as a contract carriage.
