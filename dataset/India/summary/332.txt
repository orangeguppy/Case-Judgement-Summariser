the question for determination in this appeal was whether the appellant was disqualified under section 7(d) of the representation of the people act, 1951 for election to the house of the people.
the material portion of section 7(d) of the act reads as follows: "a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being, a member of either house of parliament. . (b) if, whether by himself or by any person or body of persons in trust for him or for his benefit or on his account, he has any share or interest in a contract for. . the performance of any service undertaken by the appropriate government".
the appellant (a contractor) had entered into an agreement with the central government.
the relevant portion of the said agreement was as follows: "the contractor has offered to contract with the governor general for the provision of a motor vehicle service for the transit conveyance of all postal articles and mail bags from december 15, 1949 to december 14, 1952 and the governor general has accepted the offer.
"the government agrees to pay to the contractor rs. 200 per month during the subsistence of the agreement 'as his remuneration for service to be rendered by him ' ".
held that on the face of it the agreement was between two competent parties with their free consent, and there was a lawful cash consideration for it.
the appellant entered into the agreement with his eyes open knowing full well his rights and liabilities under the same.
84 the case was a straightforward illustration of the kind of contract contemplated by section 7(d) of the act.
at all material times the appellant had been directly concerned, for his own benefit, in the contract of carrying mail bags and postal articles entered into by him with the government in the postal department.
section 7 of the act is clearly intended to avoid a conflict between public duty and private interests.
