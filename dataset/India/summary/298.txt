when once it has been proved that a will has been executed with due solemnities by a person of competent understanding and apparently a free agent, the burden of proving that it was executed under undue influence is on the person who alleges it.
it is well settled that it is not every influence which is brought to bear on a testator that can be characterised as "undue".
it is open to a person to plead his cause before the testator and to persuade him to make a disposition in his favour.
and if the testator 133 1036 retains his mental capacity and there is no element of fraud or coercion, the will cannot be attacked on the ground of undue influence.
all influences are not unlawful.
persuasion, appeals to the affections or ties of mankind, to a sentiment of gratitude for past services or pity for future destitution, or the like, these are all legitimate and may be fairly pressed on a testator.
on the other hand pressure of whatever character, whether acting on the fears or the hopes, if so exerted as to overpower the volition without convincing the judgment, is a species of restraint under which no valid will can be made.
it cannot be laid down as a matter of law that because the attesting witnesses did not state in examination in chief that they signed the will in the presence of the testator, there was no due attestation as required by section 63 of the indian succession act.
it is a pure question of fact depending on the appreciation of evidence and the circumstances of each case whether the attesting witnesses signed in the presence of the testator.
