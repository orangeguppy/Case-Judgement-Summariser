the assessee firm carried on the business in purchase and sale of conch shells.
it obtained a lease for 3 years for gathering specified types of shells from the sea along the coastline abutting on the south arcot district.
it sought to deduct the amount paid as lease money from its profits from business on the ground that this was an expenditure not of a capital nature but wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of business.
under section 10(2)(xy) of the income tax act.
^ held, (per kapur and hidayatullah, jj., das, j. dissenting) that the expenditure was capital expenditure and could not be deducted from the profits.
the business of the assessee was buying and selling shells but when it took the lease it went in for a new speculative business of fishing for shells.
the amount paid for reserving the vast coastline for future fishing was not price paid for obtaining the stock in trade i.e. shells with which assessee did his business.
the amount was paid to obtain an enduring asset in the shape of an exclusive right to fish and the payment was not related to the shells.
