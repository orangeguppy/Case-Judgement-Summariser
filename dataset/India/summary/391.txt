an executing court cannot go behind a decree so as to vary its terms and when the obligations it imposes on the parties are reciprocal and inseverable, rendering partial execution impossible, the decree must be executed wholly as it stands or not at all.
this is particularly true of a decree for specific performance where the party who seeks execution must satisfy the executing court that he is in a position to perform the obligations which the decree imposes on him.
that in cases where the identity or substance of what the decree directs a party to give to the other is in dispute, the executing court alone has the power to decide it under section 47 of the code of civil procedure and under section 42 of the code the powers of the court executing a decree on transfer are identical with those of the court which passed the decree.
that although the remedy provided by o. xxi, r. 32(1) of the code of civil procedure is available in execution of a decree for specific performance, it can be used only by a person entitled to execute the decree and if, by reason of his own incapacity to perform his part, he is precluded from seeking execution, 0.
xxi, r. 32(1), can have no application.
consequently, in a case where, as in the present, the defendant sought to execute a decree for specific performance of a contract but was himself unable to perform one of the obligations the decree imposed on his party, namely, to transfer five annas share in a partnership firm, for the reason that the firm had ceased to exist by dissolution before the date of execution, he was not entitled to execute the decree.
held further, that the defendant could not be allowed to substitute five annas share in the assets of the dissolved firm instead, as that would amount to an alteration of the decree which the execution court was not competent to make.
