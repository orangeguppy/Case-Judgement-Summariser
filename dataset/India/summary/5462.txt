the respondent filed a first appeal in the high court against a decree and an application for stay of its operation.
before any order was made in the stay application, the appellant, who was the decree holder, levied execution, pursuant to which the respondent deposited the decretal amount in the executing court.
the respondent moved the high court for an order stay of further proceedings in execution.
the high court passed an order of stay in the application already pending before it and directed refund of the amount deposited in the executing court to the respondent.
the appellant challenged the order of refund.
allowing the appeal, ^ held: in the absence of an order of stay under 0.41, r. s(l) c.p.c., the decree was executable and the judgment debtor deposited the decretal dues in the executing court.
once the decretul dues had come into the executing court there was indeed no justification for the direction to refund the same to the judgment debtor.
on the other hand, the high court could in its discretion either direct payment of the amount to the decree holder subject to terms safeguarding the interest of the judgment debtor in the eventuality of reversal of the decree or direct the amount to be deposited or invested on terms of interest so that on the disposal of the first appeal appropriate directions could be given.
