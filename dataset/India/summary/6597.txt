the respondent landlord filed a suit under the andhra pradesh rent control act for recovery of possession and for mesne profits.
the appellant defendant raised a preliminary objection that the city civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
in the two eviction petitions filed earlier by the appellant, the respondent took the plea that since the alleged tenancy was hit by section 3 of the a.p. rent control act, eviction suit was not entertainable by the rent controller.
decreeing the suit in favour of the appellant, the trial court held that it was not open to the respondent to take such inconsistent plea regarding jurisdiction; that he cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate and he was estopped from doing so.
on appeal by respondent, the deci sion was upheld by the first appellate court.
on a second appeal preferred by the respondent, the high court reversed the trial court 's order.
aggrieved by the decision of the high court, the appel lant preferred this appeal, by special leave, contending that the principles of res judicata and estoppel were ap plicable.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
a court which has no jurisdiction in law cannot be conferred with the jurisdiction by applying principles of res judicata.
it is well settled that there can be no estop pel on a pure question of law.

in the instant case, the question of jurisdiction is a pure question of law.
the high court was right in its conclusions that in matters of jurisdiction to entertain the suit, doctrine of estoppel could not be invoked; and that the city civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, as it lay exclusively within the jurisdiction of the rent controller.
