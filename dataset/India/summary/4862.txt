the board of directors of the appellant bank was superseded by the registrar of the cooperative societies and its powers were vested in the m.p. state cooperative bank which is an apex bank as "officer in charge" of the superseded bank.
the apex bank appointed one s.p. jain as the chief executive officer of the appellant bank.
respondent no. 1, an employee of the appellant bank, was dismissed from service by s.p. jain on the ground that he had overstayed the leave granted to him.
the dy.
registrar of cooperative societies set aside the said order of dismissal and directed reinstatement of respondent no. 1, but it was reversed by the addl.
registrar in appeal by the appellant bank.
in further appeal by respondent no. 1 the board of revenue set aside the order of termination.
the high court in the writ petition filed by appellant bank agreed with the board of revenue and also ordered reinstatement of respondent no. 1.
dismissing the appeal by the appellant bank and modifying the order of the high court, ^ held: the apex bank had no authority or power so to appoint s.p. jain for two reasons: in the first place, the apex bank, being an appointee of the registrar, had no authority to divest itself of the power conferred upon it by the registrar and to invest s.p. jain with that power.
the only authority which could have conferred the necessary power on s.p. jain was the registrar.
the registrar did not confer that power upon s.p. jain under section 53 (4) of the act.
therefore the said order had no existence in the eye of law.
