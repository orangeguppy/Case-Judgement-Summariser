the property of the respondent was acquired under the u. p. land acquisition (rehabilitation of refugees) act, 1948.
the respondent challenged the constitutionality of the act by way of a writ petition and though the high court dismissed the petition it held that the two provisos to s.11 of the act were invalid as they offended section 299(2) of the government of india act.
subsequently the constitution (fourth amendment) act, 1955, included the u. p. act in the ninth schedule as item no. 15.
the appellant contended that the inclusion of the act in the ninth schedule protected it under article 31 b of the constitution from any challenge under section 299(2) of the government of india act.
held, that the u. p. act could not be assailed on the ground of unconstitutionality based on a contravention of section 299 of the government of india act.
the provisions of the act having been specifically saved by article 31 b read with the ninth schedule, the act could not be deemed to be void or to ever have become void on the ground of its having contravened the provisions of the government of india act.
