ram sanehi received two gun shot wounds on his chest, and died within ten minutes.
two of his children claimed to have witnessed the occurrence.
the dead body was subjected to post mortem only after about 24 hours had elapsed.
the same evening, appellant subhash surrendered, and appellant shyam narain was arrested, though for another offence altogether.
the sessions court convicted them under section 302 i.p.c. and sentenced subhash to death and shyam narain to imprisonment for life.
the accused moved the high court in appeal, while the sessions court referred the matter to it under section 374, for confirmation of the death sentence.
the question before this court was, whether in the case of such references, the high court was obliged to examine the entire evidence independently.
allowing the appeal, the court, ^ held: on a reference for confirmation of the sentence of death, the high court is under an obligation to proceed in accordance with the provisions of sections 375 and 376 of the criminal procedure code.
the high court must not only see whether the other order passed by the sessions court is correct but it is under an obligation to examine the entire evidence for itself, apart from and independently of the sessions court 's appraisal and assessment of that evidence.
