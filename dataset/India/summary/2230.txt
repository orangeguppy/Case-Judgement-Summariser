the government referred an industrial dispute to labour court, patna, and subsequently issued an order by way of corrigendum substituting "ranchi" for "patna".
in proceedings before the labour court, ranchi, objection was raised that once having made the reference to the labour court, patna, the government was not competent to cancel or withdraw that reference, so the labour court, ranchi had no jurisdiction.
the labour court, ranchi rejected the objection.
the high court also rejected this contention.
in appeal to this court: held: the alteration in the order of reference was a mere correction of a clerical error.
because, by mistake, patna had been mentioned in place of ranchi in the first notification and the second notification merely corrected that mistake.
such a clerical error can always be corrected and such a correction does not amount either to the withdrawal of the reference from, or cancellation of the re ference to the labour court, patna.
