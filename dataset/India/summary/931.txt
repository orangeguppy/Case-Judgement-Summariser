the respondent, a firm carrying on tannery business, used to take out licences under the provisions of the madras general sales tax act, 1939, but did not renew the licence for the assessment year, 952 1953, and was assessed to sales tax on the sale value of tanned hides and skins during the year.
it challenged the validity of the order of assessment by filing a petition before the high court under article 226 of the constitution of india, on the grounds that under section 5(vi) of the act the liability to pay sales tax in respect of hides and skins could only be at a single point, that r. 16(5) of the madras general sales tax (turnover and assessment) rules, 1939, which limited the operation of this mode of taxation to licensed dealers was ultra vires as it contravened section 5(vi) and had been so held in v. m.
syed mohammed & co. vs the state of madras, ; , and that section 6a was not applicable to the case of a dealer which did not take out a licence.
held, that section 3 of the madras general sales tax act, 1939, envisages multipoint taxation on the total turnover of a dealer, 149 but under section 5 an exception is made in the case of sale transactions of certain specified goods, providing for single point taxation subject to certain restrictions and conditions which include conditions as to licences, and if the conditions and restrictions are not complied with, under section 6a the tax is to be levied under section 3 as if the provisions of section 5 did not apply to such sales.
accor dingly, r. 16 (5) of the madras general sales tax (turnover and assessment) rules, 1939, is not ultra vires.
