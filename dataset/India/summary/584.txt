the appellant was registered under the bombay sales tax act, 1946.
he maintained double sets of account books and knowingly furnished, for the period september 30, 1950 to march 31, 1951, false returns to the sales tax officer and thereby committed an offence under section 24(1)(b) of the act.
under the act sanction of the collector was necessary before cognizance of the offence could be taken by a court.
the i946 act was repealed by the bombay sales tax act, 1952, but the 1952 act was declared ultra vires by the bombay high court.
thereupon the bombay sales tax ordinance 11 of 1952 was promulgated which provided that the 1946 act was to be deemed to have been in existence up to november 1, 1952.
this was followed by ordinance 111 of 1952 which further extended the life of the 1946 act.
thereafter, the bombay sales tax act, 1953 was passed which repealed both the 1946 act and ordinance iii of 1952.
the 1953 act made provision for an offence similar to that covered by section 24(1)(b) of the act, prescribed a similar procedure for prosecuting persons committing the said offence and saved liabilities incurred under the 1946 act.
during the period when ordinance iii of 1952 was in force the state government issued a notification appointing the additional collector to be a collector under the ordinance, and the additional collector granted sanction for the prosecution of the appellant.
the appellant was tried by the presidency magistrate before whom he pleaded guilty.
the magistrate accepted the plea, convicted him under section 24(1)(b) of the 1946 act and sentenced him to a fine of rs. 200, in default to suffer one month 's rigorous imprisonment.
the state preferred a revision to the high court for enhancement of the sentence.
the appellant contended that by the repeal of the 1946 act the offence was effaced and that the prosecution was defective inasmuch as sanction was given by the additional collector and not by the collector as required by the 1946 act.
the high court repelled both these contentions and enhanced the sentence to rigorous imprisonment for one month in addition to the fine already imposed 251 held, that the offence under section 24(1)(b) of the 1946 act was covered by the saving clause in section 48 of 953 act and the appellant could be convicted of that offence.
the saving by section 48 of the 1953 act of " any liability incurred " under the 1946 act saved both civil and criminal liability.
held, that the sanction given by the additional collector was a valid sanction for the prosecution of the appellant.
the notification issued under ordinance iii of 1952 appointing the additional collector as collector must be deemed to have been made in exercise of the relevant power in respect of the offence saved by the ordinance.
further, the notification must be deemed to have continued in force under the 1953 act by reason of section 49(2) of that act.
sanction pertains to the domain of procedure and the procedure prescribed under the new 1953 act must be followed even in respect of offences committed under the repealed 1946 act.
held further, that in the circumstances of the case the high court was justified in enhancing the sentence.
the sentence should depend upon the gravity of the offence and not upon the fact that the accused pleaded guilty or attempted to defend the case.
as the appellant had kept double sets of account books, it was eminently a case in which a substantive sentence ought to have been imposed, and the magistrate improperly exercised his discretion in awarding a sentence of fine only.
but the high court was wrong in awarding rigorous imprisonment as section 24(1)(b) provided only for simple imprisonment.
