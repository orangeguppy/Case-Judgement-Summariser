held, (per suhba rao and mudholkar, jj., sarkar, j. contra) the o.32, r.7 was not applicable to the withdrawal of the application for setting aside the sale and the order for withdrawal of that application was binding on the appellant, order 32, r. 7 is applicable only to "an agreement or compromise with reference to the suit", and there are the following limitations to its applicability: (i) it is applicable only where the rights put in issue in the suit are involved and not to mere procedural steps; (ii) it is applicable only during the pendency of the suit which includes execution proceedings; and (iii) the agreement or compromise must be with a party to the suit.

per sarkar, j.
the leave of the court under o.32, r. 7 was necessary before the guardian could enter into the agree ment or compromise to withdraw the application for setting aside the sale.
there was no justification for limiting the operation of the rule in its application to execution proceedings only to compromises which directly affected the rights and liabilities under the decree; it was applicable to all compromises which brought a proceeding to an end thereby affecting the rights and liabilities of the minor, the compromise in the present case was not merely concerned with the conduct of proceedings but it seriously affected the liability of the appellant under the decree.
