an industrial dispute between the hotel and its workmen was referred to an industrial tribunal.
the attack of the hotel was on the form of the order of reference, the main contention being that the reference was incompetent on the grounds that the union could not be made a party to the reference under the industrial disputes act, and that the reference was vague, as it did not indicate how many of the workers of different categories working in the hotel were involved in the dispute.
held, that the order of reference was perfectly competent when the parties to it and the nature of the dispute were clearly specified.
the reference which was otherwise valid does not become incompetent simply because it was mentioned therein that the workmen will be represented by such and such union in the dispute.
the addition of the name of the union was merely for the sake of convenience so that the tribunal may know to whom it should give notice when proceeding to deal with the reference ; that does not preclude the workmen from being represented by another union or even being made parties individually.
it is unnecessary for the purpose of section 10 of the act where the dispute was of a general nature relating to the terms of employment or condition of labour of a body of workmen to mention the names of particular workmen who might have been responsible for the dispute.
it was only where a dispute refers to the dismissal etc., of particular workmen as represented by the union that it would be desirable to mention the names of the workmen concerned.
