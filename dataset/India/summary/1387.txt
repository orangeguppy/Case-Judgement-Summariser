the appellant was doing business of construction as contractor under public works department in vindhya pradesh, now madhya pradesh.
he challenged the levy of sales tax on building materials supplied by him for the year 1953 54 to 1958 59.
the contention of the petitioner was that the tax was not leviable in view of the decision of the supreme court in gannon dunkerley 's case and pandit banarsi das 's case.
the respondents claimed that the tax was leviable because the case fell within the derision in mithan lal 's case.
the rajpramukh of the united state of vindhya pradesh promulgated the vindhya pradesh sales tax ordinance 2 of 1949.
on vindhya pradesh becoming part c state of india the said ordinance of rajpramukh was applied to the whole of it with effect from april 1, 1950, by notification no. 7 of march 28, 1951.
under section 2 of the part c states (laws) act, 1950, by notification no. s.r.o. 6 dated december 29, 1950, the central provinces & berar sales tax act 1947, was extended to vindhya pradesh.
the notification also added section 29 to the madhya pradesh act so extended, by which ordinance 2 of 1949 was repealed.
by reason of the decision of this court in the delhi laws act case the addition of section 29 was unconstitutional.
parliament then enacted the part c states (misc.
laws) repealing act (66 of 1951).
by section 2 of the act the vindhya pradesh sales tax ordinance, 1949, was deemed to have been repealed from december 29, 1950.
the vindhya pradesh laws (validity) act, 1952, also provided and declared that central provinces & berar sales tax act, 1947, which was extended to vindhya pradesh under section 2 of the part c states laws act, 1950, has been and shall be deemed to be in force in vindhya pradesh from april 1, 1951.
the said c. p. & berar sales tax act defined contract, goods, sales etc, and by these definition the materials used or supplied by 258 a building contractor in the constructions etc, were made liable to sales tax in accordance with the schedule rates.
the question is, whether c. p. been extended for the first time by the vindhya pradesh legislature in 1952, when it passed the vindhya pradesh laws (validating) act, 1952, to the exclusion of the order contained in the notification no. s.r.o. 6 or whether the act continued to be in force in vindhya pradesh even before and all that the vindhya pradesh act did as to remove any doubts about its validity.
the rival contentions of the appellant and the respondents are reduced to the proposition that if the state legislature of vindhya pradesh extended the central province and berar sales tax act, the extended act would suffer from disability pointed out in gannon dunkerley 's case, but if the said act was extended by the notification under part c states (laws) act, 1950, then it must be treated as incorporated in the act and to have the authority of parliament which, in relation to part c states, had no limitation whatever.
^ held, that the extended law in the c. p. & berar sales tax act, 1947, did not depend on the repeal of the earlier law for its validity.
it would have been operative, even if the earlier law was not repealed, but the earlier law was in fact repealed from december 29, 1950, and no question of conflict between the new and the old law ever arose.
held, further, that the vindhya pradesh amending act made only verbal changes, but did not alter the structure of the tax.
no doubt, that act contained certain provisions under which sales of building materials are taxable, and if the authority to tax the so called sales emanated from a state legislature, then the law would fail.
the law was first extended to the vindhya pradesh by the central government acting under the authority of parliament legislating for a part c state.
parliament and the central government were not subject to the disabilities pointed out in gannon dunkerley 's case, and the matter was covered by mithan lal 's case.
even if the notification s.r.o. no. 6 failed to repeal ordinance 2 of 1949 parliament by its own law effaced that ordinance in vindhya pradesh from december 29, 1950, and enacted that ordinance shall be deemed to be repealed from that day.
the ordinance 2 of 1949 did not continue in vindhya pradesh down to january 8, 1953 because by fiction the ordinance was repealed from december 29, 1950.
held, also, that the laws in different portions of new state of madhya pradesh were enacted by different legislatures and under section 119 of the states reorganisation act, all 259 laws in force in a state were to continue until repealed or altered by the appropriate legislature.
the different sales tax laws in different parts of madhya pradesh are valid on the ground that the differentiation arises from historical reasons, and a geographical classification based on historical reasons is not affected by article 14 of the constitution.
