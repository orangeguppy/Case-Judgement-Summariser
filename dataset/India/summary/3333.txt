under section 5 (a) and (j) of the expenditure tax act, 1957, no expenditure tax shall be payable on any expenditure incurred by the assessee wholly and exclu sively for the purpose of his business profession or vocation, and on any expenditure incurred by the assessee by way of donation.
the respondent assessee was the chairman of the state socialist party and politics was his profession or occupation.
he is a wealthy socialist and spent rs. 38,832/ towards election expenses of other candidates of his party, and gave rs. 47,867/ to the office bearers of his party to meet the expenses involved in party work.
^ held: the two amounts are eligible for exclusion from expenditure tax.
[1021 b] (1) under modern conditions, politics is a profession or occupation.
[1020 c] (2) but the expenses incurred on behalf of other candidates cannot be the assessee 's professional expenses.
[1020 d] (3) the amounts, however, fall under section 5(j) of the act.
when a person gives money to another without any material return, he donates that sum.
therefore, when the assessee gave money to the candidates of his party for their elections expenses, it was money gratuitously given, that is he made donations.
[1020 e g] (4) similarly, the amounts paid to office bearers of the party were not for any material return.
they were for loyalty or gratitude.
wholly motiveless donation is rare but material return alone negates a gift or donation.
therefore, they also were outright gifts.
