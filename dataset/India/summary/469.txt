these appeals by the state of assam and some other parties from a number of judgments of the high court of assam, passed under article 226 of the constitution, quashing certain orders of the appellate authority appointed by the governor of assam by a notification under section 3(3) of the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948, dated july 5, 1955, raised the common question of the vires of that section and the validity of the notification by which the commissioner of hills division and appeals was appointed the appellate authority.
in 1955 rival claimants applied for the grant of licenses and settlement of country spirit shops for the year 1956 57 and parties dissatisfied with the orders of the deputy commissioner and those of the 296 excise commissioner in appeals therefrom, appealed to the appellate authority whose orders were, as stated, quashed by the high court.
under the eastern bengal and assam excise act, 1910, the board which was the final appellate authority meant the provincial government and ministers, who were necessarily members of the legislature, functioned as the board.
section 296 of the government of india act, 1935, by sub section
(1) put it a ban on the members of the legislature from functioning as the board and by sub section
(2) empowered the governor to constitute a tribunal to exercise the same jurisdiction until the legislature made other provisions in that behalf.
the government of assam constituted a single member tribunal, called at first the board and later on the assam revenue tribunal, which functioned till the passing of the assam revenue tribunal act, 1946, empowering the provincial government to constitute the assam revenue tribunal consisting of three members.
in 1948 the high court of assam was established and shortly thereafter was passed the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948, abolishing the assam revenue tribunal and conferring its jurisdiction on the high court and the authority to be appointed by the provincial government under section 3(3) of the act.
the high court in disposing of the writ petitions took the view that section 296(2) of the government of india act placed a mandate on the provincial legislature to constitute the tribunal which.
it failed to do and that section 3(3) of the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948, constituted an excessive delegation of the legislative power conferred on the legislature by the government of india act, 1935, and that the said notification was repugnant to section 9 of the eastern bengal and assam excise act, 1910 and, there fore, section 3(3) of the impugned act and the notification were void and the appellate authority not having been lawfully constituted its orders were nullities.
held that section 3(3) of the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948, and the notification issued by the provincial government thereunder were not void.
the purpose of section 296(2) of the government of india act, 1935, simply was to authorise the governors of certain provinces to constitute an appellate tribunal and to prescribe a time limit upto which such tribunal was to function and not to impose either an obligation on the provincial legislatures to set up one or to compel them to restrict their powers of legislation under the act.
even assuming that it did imposesuch an obligation, it must be held to have been insubstance fully discharged by the assam legislature by the enactnentof section 3(3)of the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948.
what the assam revenue tribunal (transfer of powers) act, 1948, intended to do was to transfer the powers and jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the assam revenue tribunal 297 to the high court and to the authority to be appointed by the provincial government, and the relevant provisions of the act make it quite clear that the assam legislature had applied its mind and clearly determined that such powers and jurisdiction should be distributed between the two.
sub section (3) of section 3 of the act, although not quite happily drafted,, leaves no doubt that the legislature itself constituted the appellate authority mentioned therein and what was left to the provincial government was to select the personnel thereof, conformably to the usual practice of indian legislatures, and, consequently, it could not be said that there was an excessive delegation of legislative power to the government : the word " appointed " does not necessarily mean already appointed, it may also mean " to be appointed " at any future time.
the impugned act was in no way repugnant to the eastern bengal and assam excise act, 1910, as modified by section 296 of the government of india act, 1935, and there was no impropriety in the commissioner of hills division and appeals, assuming that he was the same as the commissioner of a division, being appointed as the authority to entertain appeals from the excise commissioner.
nor could the possibility of an appeal from the decision of any other commissioner of a division coming up before him affect the validity of the notification, and it could not be held to be repugnant to section 9(2) of that act.
