s, employed by the appellant as a cross cutter in the saw mill was asked to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of grave indiscipline and misconduct and he denied the allegations of fact.
he was thereafter informed about a department enquiry to be held against him and was suspended pending enquiry.
purporting to act under r. 18(a) of the standing orders, the appellant terminated the services of s, without holding any departmental enquiry.

^ held, that the employer 's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the standing orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right "to hire and fire" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.
even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of power, or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the tribunal had jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.
