the governor of u.p. issued a notification under section 3 a of the u.p. sales tax act, 1948, and the sales tax officer (section iv) kanpur, ordered the respondent company to pay tax on the turnover of ' carbon paper at 6%, and that of ribbon at 10%, as per entry 2 of the notification.
the respondent challenged the order in a writ petition before the high court.
contending that carbon paper was not 'paper ' with the meaning of entry 2 and its turnover was therefore to be assessed at the rate of 2% prescribed for unclassified goods, and that 'ribbon ' being an accessory and not a part of the typewriter, could only be taxed at the rate of 6% and not 10%.
the high court allowed the writ and quashed the levy.
the appellant contended that carbon paper does not lose its character as paper in spite of being subjected to chemi cal processes, and that ribbon is not an accessory but an essential part of the typewriter.
dismissing the appeal the court, held :(1) a word which is not defined in an enactment has to be understood in its popular and commercial sense with reference to the context in which it occurs.
it has to be understood according to the well established canon of construction in the sense in which persons dealing in and using the article understand it.
