the assessee appellant is a public limited company owning textile mills at indore and carrying on the business of manufacture and sale of textiles.
during the assessment year 1942 43, it effected in british india the following categories of sales viz. (a) sales canvassed by the company 's representatives amounting to rs. 6,46,028, (b) sales canvassed through brokers and agents in british india merchants and their brokers during their visit at indore amounting to rs. 2,86,224 and (iv) sales to british indian merchants at the time of their own or their brokers visit at indore amounting to rs. 2,55,916/ .
in 1968(1) s.c.r. 47, on an appeal, by revenue, arising out of a reference u/s 66(1) of the income tax act, this court held that the income by way of the sales of rs. 14,80,059/ in respect of the appellant company was income "accrued or arose" within british india and a proportionate part of it was assessable to indian income tax.
this court remitted the case to the high court to answer the reference regarding the correctness of the determination of the profits on the sales computed by the tribunal by application of rule 33 and also whether 1/3 of the profits so determined could be said to accrue or arise in british india, which the high court answered in favour of the revenue.
in the appeals before this court it was found that the high court had not taken into account the relevant circumstances for answering the reference since it was contended by both the parties that rule 33 was not applicable to the facts of the case.
as per the directions, the tribunal submitted a supplementary statement of the case wherein it found (1) that in respect of the sales canvassed by the companies representatives and through brokers and agents amounting to rs. 9,37,919 it was just and equitable to apportion 15% of the profits said to have arisen and accrued in british india and (ii) that in respect of the sales to british indian merchants and/or their brokers during their visit at indore amounting to rs. 5,42,140/ .
7 1/2 per cent of the profits could be said to have accrued and arisen in british india.
as the profits were found to represent 31.12 per cent of the turnover, the profits in respect of the turnover of rs. 9,37,919 were calculated at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent (i.e. 15% of 31.12 per cent) which amounted to rs. 42,200/ .
similarly the profits in respect of the turnover of 5,42,140/ @ the rate of 2 1/4% (7 1/2 per cent of 31.12 per cent) amounted to rs. 12,200.
the total profits for the year 1942 43 was rs. 54,400 (rs. 42,200+12,200), according to the tribunal.
accepting the appeals, the court, ^ held: (i) the question as to what proportion of the profits of the sales in the four categories arose or accrued in british india is essentially one of fact depending upon the circumstances of the case.
in the absence of some statutory or other fixed formula; any finding on the question of proportion involves same element of guess work.
the endeavour can only be to be approximate and there cannot in the very nature of things be great precision and exactness in the matter.
as long as the proportion fixed by the tribunal is based upon the relevant material, it should not be disturbed.
[716c d] (ii) in the instant case, the profit which arose and accrued in british india to the assessee appellant for the assessment year 1942 43 was rs. 54,400.
it 713 is just and equitable to apportion 15% of the profits of sales in categories (a) and (b) and 7 1/2 per cent of the profits of sales in categories (c) and (d) as accruing or arising in british india.
