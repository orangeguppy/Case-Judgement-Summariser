the relevant portion of article 5 of the constitution reads: "at the commencement of this constitution every person who has his domicile in the territory of india and who was born in the territory of india shall be a citizen of india".
article 7 of the constitution lays down: "notwithstanding anything in article 5, a person who has after the first day of march 1947, migrated from the territory of india to the territory now included in pakistan shall not be deemed to be a citizen of india".
it was contended on behalf of the respondent kumar rani who had migrated from india to pakistan in 1948 that she was, and continued to be, a citizen of india on the ground that she was born in india and her domicile continued to be that of her husband, who throughout continued to be in india and that her case was covered by article 5 of the constitution.
held (repelling the contention) that article 7 of the constitution clearly overrides article 5.
as the respondent had migrated from india to pakistan after the 1st march, 1947, her case fell under article 7 of the constitution and that inasmuch as it was a case of an unauthorised issue of an invalid permit which had been properly cancelled the proviso to article 7 did not apply and that therefore the respondent could not be deemed to be a citizen of india.
held also, that the definitions of the phrase "evacuee property" in the administration of evacuee property ordinance 1949 and the (xxxi of 1950) clearly include the interest of an evacuee in any property held as a trustee or beneficiary.
the definition of evacuee property in evacuee property ordinance 1949 (bihar ordinance no. iii of 1949) is not 1260 different and the words used therein comprise also wakf property and any interest therein.
