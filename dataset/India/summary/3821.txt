the appellant was posted as the local purchase officer at the army ordnance depot in poona district.
in connection with the purchase of some engineering tools, charges were brought against him under section 5(1)(d) read with section 5(2) of the prevention of corruption act, for having procured pecu niary benefit for a certain contractor by corrupt means, thereby causing wrongful loss to the army department.
the trial court convicted the appellant, and in appeal the high court confirmed the conviction.
the supreme court granted him special leave to appeal under article 136 of the constitu tion, and allowing the appeal, held: 1.
both the courts below had proceeded on the footing that it was for the accused to prove the ingredients of section 5(1)(d) of the act.
this approach was wrong.
it was for the prosecution to prove affirmatively that the appel lant by corrupt or illegal means or by abusing his position obtained any pecuniary advantage for some other person.
[536 c d] 2.
normally this court in special leave against a con current judgment of the high court and the trial court does not re appraise the evidence, but here we find that both the courts below have drawn wrong inferences from proved facts and have made a completely wrong approach to the whole case by misplacing the onus of proof which lay on the prosecution on the accused and presuming that the accused had a dishon est intention.
