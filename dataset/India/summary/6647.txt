the petitioners, carrying,on import export of diamonds, field applications for registration as export houses and grant of additional import licences under para 174 and 176 of the import and export policy 1978 79 which were rejected by the authorities on the ground that they have failed to diversify their exports of "other products" during the year 1977 78.
they challenged the order of the authorities by filing writ petitions before the bombay high court under article 226 of the constitution.
one of the petitions was dismissed by a learned single judge of the high court and the said petitions filed an appeal before a division bench of the high court.
during the pendency of the appeal 233 and the writ petition,the supreme court by its order dated april 18, 1985 decided the case of union of india vs rajnikant bros. holding that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of export houses certificates in the import export policy for the year 1978 79 but the grantee of additional licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded in the export policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the import policy prevailing at the time import.
the high court decided the cases of the petitioners in accordance with the decision of this court in union of india vs rajnikant bros. purusant to the decision of the bombay high court petitioners were granted export house certificates and additional import licences which were valid for 12 months, with the same condition as provided by this court in its order dated april18, 1985 in the case of rajnikant.
however, the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said licences till 31st march,1988.on 1.4.1988, the government of india issued a revised export and import policy for the period 1988 91.under para 215 of the said revised policy certain flexibilities were granted in the matter of imports to the grantees of additional import licences.
however, under para 218(10) of the said revised policy the holdersof the additional import licences issuedprior to 1.4.1988 were made ineligible for the benefit of flexibilities in import as contained in para 215(4).
since ,the petitioners were holding licences issued prior to 1.4.1988 they could not avail the flexibilities in import as contained in para 215 of the 1988 91 policy.
consequently, they filed writ petitions in this court challenging the validity of para218(10) of the 1988 91 policy contending (i) that all the export houses who were granted additional licences constitute at single class and their classification on the basis of date or on the basis of period of exports has no connection with the object sought to be achieved by the 1988 91 policy; (ii) that para 218(10) of 1988 91 policy arbitrarily discriminates between export houses who were issued additional licences prior to 1.4.1988 since the benefits ofpara 214 of 1988 91 policy were conferred only on the latter; (iii) that in view of the judgement of this court in c.naveenchandra and co. vs union of india, [1987] 2 s.c.r. 989 the petitioners should be treated at par with the grantees of additional licences under the export policy for the subsequent years and since there has been relaxation in the matter of policy of canalisation of imports under para 215(4) in respect additional licences granted to export houses under the 1988 91 policy, the petitioners were also entitled to a similar relaxation.
dismissing the petitions, this court, 234 held: 1.
the right to equality guaranteed under article 14 ensures equality amongst equals and its aim is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory treatment.
it means that all persons similarly circumstance shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.
conversely discrimination may result if persons dissimilarily situate are treated equally.
even amongst persons similarly situate differential treatment wouldbe permissible between one class and the other.
in that event it is necessary that the differential treatment should be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational relation tothe object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.
[242h, 243a b] 2.
a close examination of the import & export policy 1978 79 and the import & export policy 1988 91 shows that there is material difference between the conditions for grant of additional licences under import policy 1978 79 and the conditions for grant of such licences under the import policy 1988 91.
while in the import & export policy 1978 79 the emphasis was only on the f.o.b. value of exports without taking into account the outgo of foreign exchange in importing the goods required for achieving the exports by an export house and additional licences were granted for a much larger amount at a higher percentage on the basis of the f.o.b.value of the exports, where as in the import & export policy 1988 91 there is a more realistic appraisal of actual benefit to the country ' economy by the exports by taking into account the net foreign exchange earnings after deducting the value of the imports and additional licences are issued on the basis of the net foreign exchange earnings for a much lesser value on a smaller percentage.
therefore, the basis for the grant of additional licences which are entitled to relaxation in import under the 1988 91 policy is different from the basis on which additional licences were granted under the 1978 79 policy.
[243c, 245b c,248a] 3.
the petitioners were not granted additional licences on the basis of net foreign exchange earnings and they have secured the additional licences on the basis of f.o.b. value of the exports, without taking into account the value of goods imported by them for achieving the exports.
it cannot be said that the petitioners who have been granted additional licences under the 1978 79 policy and the export houses who were granted additional licences under the 1988 91 policy are persons similarly circumstanced.
therefore the petitioners cannot claim the same facilities that have been provided to export houses who are granted additional licences under the 1988 91 policy.
hence they have failed to make out a case for interference by this court under 235 article 32 and consequently they cannot assail the validity of para 218(10) of the import & export policy 1988 91.[245e, 243d, 245f, 249c, 248b] 4.
export houses, like the petitioners, who were granted additional licences on the basis of order of this court dated april 18, 1985 are not to be treated at par with export houses who are granted additional licences under the import & export policy prevalent at the time of import.
import of canalised items under additional licences issued to the petitioners would be permissible if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permits them to import such items.
therefore the rights of the petitioners under the additional licences issued to them would be governed by the terms of the import policy prevailing at the time of import.[246a b, 247e, 247h] d. naveenchandra & co. bombay & anr.
