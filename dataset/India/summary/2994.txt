the assessee who was successor in business to her deceased husband was sought to be taxed under section 41 (1) of the income tax act, 1961, in respect of certain amount received by her by way of remission from the sales tax recovered from her husband.
on the 'question whether the amount was assessable under section 41(1) of the act.
held : section 41(1) does not apply, because, the assessee who is sought to be taxed is not the assessee contemplated by the section.
if the husband of the assessee had been alive and had received the amount which had been remitted during his life time he would certainly have been liable to pay tax under the provisions of section 41(1).
but the husband having died the revenue could not take any advantage of its provisions.
the act does not contain any provision making a successor in business or the legal representative of an assessee to whom an allowance has already been granted liable to tax under section 41(1) in respect of the amount remitted and received by the successor or the legal representative.
