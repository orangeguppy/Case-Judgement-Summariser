sections 306 and 307 of the code of criminal procedure, read together clearly indicate that where the sessions judge disagrees with the verdict of the jury and is of the opinion that the case should be submitted to the high court, he must submit the whole case against the accused, not a part of it.
if the jury returns a verdict of guilty in respect of some charges and notguilty in 961 respect of others he cannot record his judgment of acquittal in respect of the latter charges in agreement with the jury in contravention of the mandatory provision of section 307(2) of the code.
such recording must have the effect of preventing the high court from considering the entire evidence against the accused and exercising its jurisdiction under section 307(3).

the emperor vs bishnu chandra das, , king emperor vs ananda charan ray, , and emperor vs nawal behari, , considered.
consequently, in a case where eight persons were put up for trial in the court of session charged under sections i47 and 304/i49 of the indian penal code and four of them were further charged under section 201 of the indian penal code and the jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty under section 304/i49 and guilty under sections 147 and 201 and the judge accepting the former recorded a judgment of acquittal in the case of each accused but disagreeing with the latter referred the matter to the high court, the reference was incompetent and the high court was in error in acting upon it and its judgment must be set aside.
held further, that although the proper order in such a case should be to remit the case to the trial court for disposal according to law, in view of the long lapse of time and peculiar circumstances of this case the reference must be rejected.
