the areas in question which were parts of two estates belonging to the appellants, called gangole a and gangole c, were situated in what was known as the godavari agency tract which was governed by the scheduled districts act, 1874.
by section 92 of the government of india act, 1935, no act of the provincial legislature was applicable to certain areas in which the godavari agency was included, unless the governor by public 536 notification so directed.
the madras estates (abolition and conversion into ryotwari) act, 1948, was enacted in 1948, and on august 15, 1950, the government of madras issued a notification under section 1(4) of the act by which, among other estates, gangole a and gangole c in their entirety were purported to be taken over, specifying september 7, 195o, as the date on which the vesting was to take place.
but as no action as contemplated by section 92 of the government of india act, 1935, had been taken to render the madras act of 1948 applicable to the godavari agency tract, only parts of the gangole estates were within the operation of that act, while there were portions of the estates which were outside its purview and operation.
when this legal situation was noticed another notification was issued on september 5, 1950, by which the areas in question were excluded from the scope of the notification dated august 15, 1950.
in exercise of the power under para 5(2) of the fifth schedule to the constitution, madras regulation iv of 1951 was passed on september 8, 1951 by which, inter alia, the act of 1948 was made applicable to the areas in which the two gangole estates were situate with retrospective effect from april 19, 1949.
on january 14, 1953, the government of madras issued a notification vesting those portions of the gangole estates to which the act of 1948 was extended.
the appellants challenged the legality of the notification on the ground that the various provisions of the madras estates (abolition and conversion into ryotwari) act, 1948, showed that the act contemplated the taking over of estates as a unit and not in parts, while what the government had done in the present case was to deal with the two estates of gangole a and gangole c as if each one of them were really two estates, one that which lay in the godavari agency tract and the other outside that area, and had issued notifications in respect of these units separately.
held, that the first notification dated august 15, 1950, as modified by that dated september 5, 1950, was valid and effective in law to vest the portion of the estate to which it related in the state government.
held further, that the notification dated january 14, 1953, was equally valid.
the action taken by the government in issuing the said notification was in conformity with the scheme of the act of 1948 that the entirety of the estate should be taken over.
