a munsif appointed one r as a commissioner for seizing the account books of the plaintiff in a suit and to produce them before him.
r seized the account books, and while they were still in his possession the appellants offered a bribe to r for being allowed to tamper with them.
the appellants were tried and convicted under section 165 a of the indian penal code.
the appellants contended that the munsif had no jurisdiction to appoint a commissioner for seizing account books, that the appointment of r as a commissioner was null and void and that consequently r was not a public servant and the appellants committed no offence in offering him a bribe.
the respondent urged that the munsif had jurisdiction under his inherent powers under section 151, code of civil procedure, to appoint the commissioner and that in any case as r was in actual possession of the situation of a public servant within explanation 2 to section 21 of the indian penal code, he would be deemed to be a public servant.
held, that r was not a public servant and the appellants did not commit any offence under section 165 a of the penal code by offering him a bribe.
the munsif had no inherent powers to appoint a commissioner to seize account books and his order was null and void.
the inherent powers under section 151, code of civil procedure, were with respect to the procedure to be followed by a court in deciding the cause before it; such powers did not extend over the substantive rights of litigants.
a party had full rights over his account books and the court had no inherent power to forcibly seize his property.
explanation 2 to section 21, indian penal code, applied only to a person actually in possession of a pre existing office of a public servant.
in the present case there was no post or office of a commissioner in existence which could be said to have been occupied by r. his appointment being without jurisdiction r could not be deemed to be a public servant. 885
