the respondent executed an agreement to sell his house in order to meet family necessities for a certain sum on the condition that he and his mother would execute a sale deed in favour of the appellant, on the failure of the execution of the sale deed the appellant instituted a suit for specific performance of the contract.
the trial court held that the sale was not for legal necessity and therefore decreed the suit in part directing that the respondent would execute the sale deed for the alienation of his interest in the entire house and that the appellant would be entitled to get possession of the same jointly with the respondent 's mother.
the appellant appealed to the high court and during its pendency the respondent 's mother died and therefore the only question urged on behalf of the appellant was that the respondent, having perfected his title to the entire house, be made to sell the same.
the high court did not agree with the contention and held that section 18 (a) of the specific relief act did not apply to the facts of the case as it comes into operation subsequent to the sale having taken place.
on appeal by special leave.
held: the high court was wrong in not applying the provisions of section 18(a) of the act to the facts of the case.
the expression 'subsequently to the sale or lease ' in section 18(a) means subsequently to the contract to sell or let.
this clause cannot be restricted in its application to cases where actual sale or lease of property had taken place.
