the appellant sued the respondent for damages for breach of contract.
the respondent pleaded that the appellant had contracted as agent for its disclosed principal and had no right to sue.
the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers showed that the appellant had entered into the contract on account of the disclosed principal; but in the confirmation slips and subsequent letters exchanged between the parties no reference was made to the principal nor did the appellants describe themselves as acting or signing on his behalf.
^ held, that it is well established in commercial usage that the bought and sold notes issued by the brokers, where 82 there is no variation or disparity between them, constitute the contract that must bind the parties.
but where the bought and sold notes show material variations, neither of them nor both of them taken together can be relied upon for proving the terms of the contract.
since there was no disparity in the instant case between the two notes which specifically mentioned the appellants as acting on account of the disclosed partner, it must be held that the appellants had entered into the contract on behalf of the disclosed partner and as such was not entitled to sue.

held, further, that in deciding whether or not the agent had entered into the contract on behalf of the principal, the way he signed the document must be considered in the light of the recitals in the relevant document.
in the instant case, the letters and the confirmation slips must be read in the light of the bought and sold notes and presumed to be consistent with them and it would, therefore, be unreasonable to attach undue importance to the signature or how the parties described themselves.
