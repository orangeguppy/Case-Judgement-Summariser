mr. r.p. pandey, one of the commissioners has been staying at allahabad and he does not find it convenient to shift to the site.
the matter has reached a stage where presence of all the officers and the commissioners at the site has become almost indispensable.
not much of his serv ices can be utilised if he is allowed to stay at allahabad.

in his place, shri prem singh, retired district judge would be appointed as one of the commissioners.
the registry shall take steps to intimate him of the assignment at his v arana si address.
