the appellant was registered as a dealer under the various sales tax acts in force in bombay from time to time i.e. bombay acts 5 of 1946, 3 of 1953 and 51 of 1959.
in the course of its assessments to sales tax for the periods from 1st april, 1948 to 31st march, 1950, and from 1st april 1950 to 31st march, 1951, the appellant claimed exemption from tax, inter alia, in respect of certain despatches of goods from its head office in bombay to its branches in other states.
the sales tax officer rejected these claims but, in appeal, the assistant collector accepted the claim in respect of the despatches to various branches though he rejected all other claims for exemption.
he also directed a refund of the excess 'tax collected from the appellants.
while revision petitions filed by the appellant against these orders were pending, a notice was issued to him on january 7, 1963 by the deputy commissioner of sales tax in form xxiv under section 31 of the bombay sales tax act, 1953, intimating the appellant that he proposed to revise suo motu the orders passed by the assistant collector in so far as he had allowed deduction in respect of the entire goods despatched to the appellants ' branches outside maharashtra because, in so doing, he had overlooked certain provisions of law which were specified in the notice.
tile appellant filed a petition under article 226 of the institution seeking to quash the notice dated 7th january, 1963 but his petition was dismissed by the high court.
in the appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the appellant, inter alia (i) that in exercise of the revisional powers, the deputy commissioner, whether acting under the sales tax act of 1946, or of 1953, or of 1959, could only proceed to take action on the basis of the material already present on the record and was not entitled to act on conjecture or to institute any enquiry so as to include additional material nor to judge the correctness of the order sought to be revised; (ii) that the notice in question was issued on 7th january, 1963, when the act of 1959 had already come into force and the act of 1953 had been repealed; so that any revisional jurisdiction could only be exercised by the deputy commissioner under the act of 1959 and not under the act of 1953 , as the power under section 57 of the act of 1959 could only be exercised within five years from the date of the order sought to be revised; the notice issued by the deputy commissioner was time barred; and (iii) that the proceedings to be instituted were barred by time, because limitation of a reasonable time; within which the revisional powers are to be exercised must be implied in the statute itself.
493 held : the proceedings initiated by the deputy commissioner of sales tax against the appellant were not incompetent and the high court was right in refusing the writ sought by the appellant.
(i) whenever a power is conferred on an authority to revise an order, it is entitled to examine the correctness, legality and propriety of the order and to pass such suitable orders as it may think fit in the circumstances of the particular case.
the proceedings for revision, if started suo motu, must not be based on a mere conjecture and there should be some ground for invoking the revisional powers.
once these powers are invoked, the actual interference must be based on sufficient grounds and, if it is considered necessary that some additional enquiry should be made to arrive at a proper and just decision, there can be no bar to the revising authority holding or directing a further enquiry and thereafter admitting additional material.

in the present case,.
the notice issued by the deputy commissioner, on the face of it, disclosed the reasons which led him to take proceedings for exercising his revisional powers suo motu, and it could not be said on those facts that he was acting merely on conjecture.
there was no reason to think that, when proceeding with his inquiry, he would not keep within the limitations indicated by this court in k. m. cheria abdullas case.
(ii) the effect of section 77(1) (a) of the act of 1959 is to continue in force the act of 1953 as well as: the act of 1946 to the extent to which they were in force when the act of 1959 came into force for the purposes of levy, assessment, reassessment and collection of sales tax.
fur thermore, by virtue of section 7(e) of the bombay general clauses act, 1904, which was made applicable to the repeal of the act of 1953 by section 77(3) of the 1959 act, any legal proceeding in respect of levy, imposition or recovery of tax is to continue and any fresh investigation, legal proceeding or remedy could be instituted as if there had been no repeal by the act of 1959.
consequently, the repeal of the act of 1953 did not in any way affect the power of the deputy commissioner to institute proceedings for revision suo motu against the appellate order of the assistant collector which had been passed in exercise of his power under the act of 1946.
[499 c 500 b] although the deputy commissioner, in seeking to exercise revisional powers should have proceeded under section 22 of the act of 1946 and not under section 31 of the 1953 act, this fact was immaterial as the provisions of the two sections were similar.
[500 d e] (iii) section 22 of the act of 1946 and section 31 of the act of 1953 do not lay down any period of limitation for the exercise of the power of revision by a deputy commissioner suo motu and no such limitation could be read in the two acts.
