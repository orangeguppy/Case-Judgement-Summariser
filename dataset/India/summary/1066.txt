under the customary law prevalent amongst the hindu jats of grewal got in ludhiana, a daughter is a preferential heir to her father in respect of his self acquired property to his collaterals.
rattigan 's digest of customary law, paragraph 23, which records the correct law on the point, is not in conflict with riwaji am, 1882, question no. 43, which refers only to ancestral property and not to self acquired property at all.

case law discussed.
the doctrine of surrender in hindu law is based on a theory of complete self effacement by the widow in favour of the reversioner and in order that such surrender can accelerate the reversion, it must be of the entire interest in the entire property.
the law does not recognise a partial self effacement nor a division between ancestral and non ancestral property.
the exception made in respect of a small portion of the property retained for the widow 's maintenance does not detract from the rigour of the rule.

consequently, in a case where a hindu widow of the jat grewal got made a gift only of the self acquired property of her husband to her daughters such gift had not the effect of a surrender in law so as to accelerate the daughters ' succession and the gift could not be valid beyond her lifetime.
