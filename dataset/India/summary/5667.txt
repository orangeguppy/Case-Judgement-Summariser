2.1 in india, there has been a trend that reasons should be stated in the award.
the reasons that are set out must be reasons which will not only be intelligible but also deal with the substantial points that have been raised.
when the arbitration clause required the arbitrator to give a reasoned award, the sufficiency of the reasons depend upon the facts of the particular case.
he is not bound to give detailed reasons.
[435c d] 2.2 the court does not sit in appeal over the award and review the reasons.
the court can set aside the award only if it is apparent from the award that there is no evidence to support the conclusions or if the award is based upon any legal proposition which is erroneous.[435d e] 2.3 the award in question is unassailable.
according to the arbitrator, because of the letter dated 18th october, 1982 of the petitioner addressed to the respondent stating that if the outstandings and interest are not paid, further supplies would not be made, has been acted upon by the petitioner, which had not delivered any coke to the respondent, or made any offer to do so, the petitioner was not entitled to the interest in respect of the period from 18th october, 1982 onwards, nor to shifting charges in respect of any shifting on or after 18th october, 1982.
on this reasoning, he had given the award.
how the arbitrator has drawn inference is apparent from the reasons.
no proposition was stated in the aforesaid reasons, which could be objected to as an error of law.
the reasons given by the arbitrator meet the requirements of a reasoned award.
it is apparent that the arbitrator has not acted irrelevantly and unreasonably.
[432e g; 434g h] 2.4 arbitration procedure should be quick and that quickness of the decision can always be ensured by insisting that short intelligible indications of the grounds should be available to find out the mind of the arbitrator for his action.
this was possible in the instant case where the arbitrator has spoken his mind, and he is clear as to how he acted 428 and why he acted in that manner.[434h; 435a] champsey bhara and company vs jivraj balloo spinning and weaving company ltd., air, ; hindustan steelworks construction ltd. vs shri c. rajasekhar rao, 3 s.c. 239; siemens engineering and manufacturing company of india ltd. vs union of india, [1976] suppl.
