; the petitioners raised the following points: (i) that the total ceiling area allowed to be retained by the 1953 act in respect of agricultural land in khas possession of the raiyats was drastically reduced; (ii) that although the status of raiyats was conferred on the erstwhile landlords which was heritable and transferable, the institution of bargards was introduced in order to enable the raiyats to cultivate their lands on a 50:50 basis and, (iii) that while the amendment act of 1972 had given a right to the raiyats to resume the lands given to the bargardars for their personal cultivation; the subsequent amendments took away this right and made the right of the bargardar both heritable and transferable causing serious detriment and prejudice to the raiyats.
dismissing the petitions, the court.
^ held :1.1 the impugned amendments were manifestly and pointedly made for the purpose of giving effect to and securing the objects of article 39(b) because these acts clearly intended to distribute the material resources of the community viz, the agricultural lands to a large number of tillers of the soil in order to serve the common good on the aforesaid people.
the amendments fall within the letter and spirit of article 39(b) of the constitution.
1 lie acts have not touched the non agricultural home stead lands, or buildings of the land owners standing thereon but has taken over only a major portion of the agricultural lands, leaving with the landlords a portion prescribed within the 850 ceiling limit and distributed the excess to the tillers of the soil which alone constitute their main source of sustenance and livelihood.
the claim of the raiyats (erstwhile landlords) that the acts amount to confiscation is absolutely untenable and amounts only to shedding crocodile tears and an anathema or taboo.
[860 h; 861 a b; 860 g] 1.2 the error regarding the addition of amending acts as items of entry in the ninth schedule was inadvertently crept in the decision of sri sri kalimata thakarani 's case.
even if the acts were not included in the ninth schedule their constitutional validity could not be questioned because the provisions are otherwise reasonable and give full effect to the pragmatic and socialistic approach as contained in article 39(b) of the constitution.
