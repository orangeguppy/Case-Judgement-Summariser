the respondent was appointed as a staff artist in the all india radio under an agreement on contract basis.
on november 2, 1967 the government of india passed an order stating that staff artists should be allowed to remain in service upto the age of 55 years and accordingly a clause was added to the agreement executed by the respondent.
clause 4(v) of the agreement however provided that the respondent 's service will be liable to be terminated on six months notice on either side.
on october 5, 1970 a notice was issued to the respondent intimating that his services would stand terminated on the expiry of six months from the date of that notice.
the respondent challenged the validity of the termination notice by a writ petition.
a learned single judge of the high court and the division bench of the high court found that the post of staff artists held by the respondent was a 'civil post ' within the meaning of article 311(1) of the constitution and had the protection of article 311.
though the authority to terminate the respondent 's service emanated from the contract but nevertheless it has the effect of violating article 311(1) of the constitution.
the notice of termination was found void as it did not comply with article 311(2).
hence this appeal.
agreeing with the high court dismissing the appeal this court, held: that the staff artists of the all india radio hold civil posts under the government and article 311 of the constitution is applicable to them.
