each of the appellants in the two appeals who were tenants of land in tanjore on which non residential premises had been constructed by them, applied to the munsif under section 9 of the madras city tenants protection act, 1921 (111 of 1922) to have the respective sites conveyed to them after fixing the sale price as contemplated by the act.
pending the decision of he applications by the munsif, the protection and rights given to the tenants who had constructed buildings on leased and by the principal act was withdrawn by act xiii of 1960, in respect of non residential buildings in tanjore but with regard to the cities of madras, salem, madurai, coimbatore and tiruchirappalli the protection and rights were retained both as regards residential buildings and non residential buildings.
the appellants applied under article 226 of the constitution to the high court of madras praying for a mandamus directing the munsif to determine their applications under section 9 of the principal act as extended to the town of tanjore by notification and the act of 1955 ignoring act xiii of 1960 which was impugned as offending articles 14, 19 and 31 of the constitution.
the high court upheld the validity of the act following the earlier decision of that court.
held that confining the protection to residential buildings only in the town of tanjore while giving protection to tenants of both residential and non residential buildings in the other 283 towns was based upon real differences between tanjore and the other towns regarding the pressure on non residential accommodation and other relevant factors including population and that the differentiation was related to the object namely protecting tenants of residential buildings principally and also of nonresidential buildings where the need was most felt.
