(2) the high court has no authority to direct further enquiry to be made in respect of recording the statement of one mr. bhatt, an advocate or to consider the reports made by the enquiry officer and come to the conclusion about his guilt or to issue show cause notice of punishment.
(3) the direction of the high court that the statement 0f mr. bhatt is recorded was passed without hear ing the petitioner and this violated the rules of natural justice.

the high court held: (1 ) the post of the registrar of small causes court does not fall within the expression "judicial service" within the meaning of article 235 and (2) the high court has no disciplinary jurisdiction over the registrar in view of the fact that the high court is not the "appointing authority".
