the house of the appellant, a cloth merchant, was searched and three lengths of cloth were recovered which were subsequently identified as having been stolen from a shop in a dacoity in which clothes, ornaments, cash etc.
were stolen.
the appellant was not named by the eye witnesses or in the dying declaration as having taken part in the dacoity.
relying on the discovery of the cloth and their identification the high court convicted him under section 396 penal code.
the court observed that it was legitimate to infer that he was one of the dacoits in view of illustration (a) to section 114 of the evidence act.
in the appeal to this court it was contended that the high court should have convicted the appellant only under section 411 penal code.
allowing the appeal, held : on the facts the only legitimate presumption to be drawn is that the appellant knew that the goods were stolen but he did not know that they were stolen in a dacoity.
all the property which was stolen by the dacoits was not recovered from the appellant.
the appellant, a cloth merchant, may well have acquired these goods as a receiver.
it has not been shown that in the village in which the appellant lived it was known that a dacoity had taken place and goods had been stolen in the dacoity.
