the appellant gave the highest bid at the auction of an arrack shop but his bid was considered inadequate.
the shop was re auctioned and the bid of 'c ' was provisionally ac cepted.
'c ' failed to comply with certain requirements and the shop was again re auctioned in which the bid offered was lower than that offered by the appellant in the original sale.
the respondent sought recovery of the difference between the original sale amount and the resale amount from the appellant, under rule 21 of the tamil nadu toddy and arrack shops (disposal in auction) rules, 1981.
the appel lant challenged the recovery by filing a writ petition in the high court which was dismissed by a single judge and the decision was confirmed by a division bench on appeal.
in the appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that since his bid was not confirmed under the rules, no recovery can be made from him and that 'c ', whose bid was provisionally accepted, was liable for the notional loss.
the respondent however contended that since 'c ' failed to comply with rule 15, his bid was not provi sionally accepted and hence he was not liable for the re sultant loss.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
normally it may be correct to say that the sale officer under rule 16 accepts provisionally the bid after there is compliance of rule 15; but in the instant case, the court is concerned with the re auction and about the liabil ity of the original highest bidder in the light of rule 20(4).
[616d e] 610 2.
in view of the document dated 19th june, 1981 it must be held that the bid of 'c ' was accepted provisionally by the sale officer and by virtue of rule 20 sub rule (4) when once the bid of 'c ' was accepted provisionally as the high est bid, the bid with which the sale began namely the bid of the appellant, got lapsed and consequently the appellant cannot be held liable for the resultant loss.
