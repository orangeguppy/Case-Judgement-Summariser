in other words, there must be proof that the rash or negligent act of the accused was the proximate cause of the death.
there must be direct nexus between the death of a person and the rash or negligent act of the accused.

[521 d e] as the conviction of the first appellant under section 304 a i.p.c. could not be sustained, the conviction of second appellant under section 201 i.p.c. had to be set aside.
because to, establish the charge under section 201, the prosecution must first prove that an offence had been committed not merely a suspicion that it might have been committed and that the accused knowing or having reason to believe that such an offence had been committed, and with the intent to screen the offender from legal punishment, had caused the evidence thereof to disappear.
the proof of the commission of an offence is an essential requisite for bringing home the offence under section 201 i.p.c. [517 d g; 521 f g] palvinder kaur vs state of punjab, , and kurban hussein mohammedan rangwalla vs state of maharashtra ; , followed.
