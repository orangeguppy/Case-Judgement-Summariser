the sales tax authorities levied tax on the sales of liquor effected by the respondent who was a wholesaler in that commodity.
impugning the levy, the respondent contended in the high court that when it sold liquor against permits issued by the authorities there was no volition because the price and the quantity of goods to be sold and the person to whom sold were all fixed and therefore there was no sale in the eye of law which would attract tax.
the department, on the other hand, contended that even when goods were sold against a permit there was still an area of volition in that the parties could decide on the quality and brand of liquor, the quantity, whether in bulk or in instalments, the size of the package and so on, all of which showed that there was no restraint on the volition of the parties and therefore there was sale which attracted tax.
a single judge of the high court, following a decision of the division bench of the same high court in jagatjit distilling and allied industries ltd. vs the state [28 stc 709], quashed the order of assessment.
a division bench dismissed the appeal in limine.
