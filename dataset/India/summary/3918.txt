the appellant 's land was acquired by the state government under section 5 of the hyderabad land acquisition act, a notification under section 3(1) was published on the 28th february, l958 and on the 13th of january, 1962 the land acquisition officer, aurangabad, made an award directing payment of compensation inclusive of 15% solatium to the appellant at the rate of 37 n.p.
per sq. yard as against his claim for payment of compensation at the rate of rs.10/ per sq. yard.
the award was communicated to the appellant on the 20th of january, 1962 and on the 5th february, 1962 he filed an application for review before the land acquisition officer who made a recommendation through the collector to the secretary to the state government that the award be reconsidered.
but, the collector by his order dated the 23rd of march, 1962 declined to forward the same.
on the 14th of may, 1962 the appellant applied for reference under section 14(1) of the hyderabad land acquisition act which is in pari materia with section 18 of the land acquisition act, 1894, praying that the period spent in the proceedings for the review be excluded while computing the period of limitation prescribed under section 14 of the limitation act.
the assistant collector, aurangabad, who was the land acquisition officer, made a reference to the district court of aurangabad, .without opining whether the application was time barred or not.
the government raised a preliminary objection the application being time barred.
the reference was incompetent.
the objection prevailed, both the district court and the high court.
the appellant contended that while dealing with a reference under section 14(1) of the hyderabad act, the court cannot go into the question that the application was time barred under section 18(2) of the and acquisition act, 1894 and tbereby refuse to entertain the reference.
dismissing the appeal, the court ^ held: (1) the power of the collector to make a reference under section 18 is circumscribed by the conditions laid down therein.
these conditions are matters of substance and their observance is a condition precedent to the collector 's power of reference.
the fulfilment of these conditions, particularly the one regarding limitation are the conditions, subject to which the power of the collector to make the reference exists.
therefore, the making of are application for reference within the time prescribed by proviso to section 18(2) is a sine qua non for a valid reference by the collector.
