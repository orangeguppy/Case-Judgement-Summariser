the appellant company used to employ messrs. section m. chou dhary as its contractors for doing certain work for it and the contractors in their turn used to employ some workmen to carry out the work which they took on contract.
a dispute having arisen between the contractors and their workmen an application was made before the conciliation board by the workmen in which both the company and the contractors were parties and four matters were referred, namely, non grant of bonus for two years, non grant of festival holidays, non fixation of minimum wages of those workmen at par with the workmen of the company and non abolition of the contract system.
as conciliation failed the government referred the dispute to the industrial tribunal under the u.p. industrial disputes act in which only three points out of the four mentioned above were referred and the question of non abolition of the contract system was not referred.
the parties to this reference were the contractors and their workmen and not the appellant company.
by a subsequent notification, however, the government impleaded the company as a party to the dispute but did not amend the previous referring order by 190 adding the fourth point of dispute which was before the conciliation board, namely, the non abolition of the contract system.
the industrial tribunal framed a number of issues the most important of which was whether the workmen concerned were the employees of the appellant company or of the contractors and came to the conclusion that those workmen were in fact and in reality the employees of the company.
on appeal by the company by special leave, held, that on such a reference there could be no jurisdiction in the tribunal to decide the question whether these workmen were the workmen of the company or of the contractors, for such a question was not referred to the tribunal.
