the appellants filed a suit as reversioners of w questioning the gift.
the "it 'as decreed and the decree was confirmed on appeal.
after coming into force of the on 17 6 1956, the widow again made a gift of the same, lands to the respondent.
she died in 1963.

8 of the act must be interpreted as merely meaning "in the case of intestacy of a hindu male" and to place this interpretation on the act is not to give retrospective effect to its provisions.
the reference is only to the fact of 'intestacy.
the material point of time is the date when the succession opens, namely, the death of the widow.
thus this propositions follow (i) succession opens on the death of the limited owner, and (ii) the law then in force would govern the succession.

(ii)succession to w 's estate in the present cage opened when his widow died and it would have to be decided on the basis that w died in 1963 when his widow died.
in that case succession to his estate would have to be decided on the basis of section 8 of the .
the accepted position under the hindu law is that where a limited owner succeeds to an estate the succession to the estate on her death will have to be decided on the basis that the last full owner died on that day.
if, therefore, succession opens and is to be decided on the basis of the last full owner dying on the date of the death of the limited owner it is only the law in force at the time of the death of the limited owner that should govern the case.
to hold that the old hindu law applies to such a case is to allow your imagination to boggle.

we can see no reason either in principle or on authority why the principle consistently followed under the earlier hindu law that on the death of the limited owner succession opens and would be decided on the basis that the last male owner died on that day, should not apply even after coming into force of the act.
in the view we have taken it is section 8 of the act that applies and not the customary law.[534c d,e f.535g]
