dismissing the special leave petition, ^ held:1.
if the order of committal for contempt of court is made by a single judge of the high court, there is one statutory right of appeal to a division bench of not less than two judges.
if the order of committal of contempt of court is made by a bench, an appeal lies as of right to the supreme court.

as there was a clear breach of the undertaking given by the petitioners, the single judge was quite right in giving appropriate directions to close the breach.
