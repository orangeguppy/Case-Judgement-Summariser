the charity commissioner in appeal confirmed this finding and an application under section 72 to the district judge by the respondent was rejected on the view that the institution at nasik was a place of religious worship within the meaning of the definition in section 2(9) of the act.
however, the high court allowed an appeal and set aside the order of the assistant charity commissioner.
