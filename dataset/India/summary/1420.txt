the owner of a certain plot of land granted a perpetual lease of it on an annual rent to some persons who sublet it to the respondent on a higher rent.
the respondent sublet the plot to the appellant on a still higher rent.
in all the three deeds of lease it was recited that the lessee might construct buildings on the land after obtaining sanction of the appropriate authority but on the dates of all the three leases the plot was assessed for agricultural purposes under the bombay land revenue code, 1879.
the appellant obtained sanction of the collector for conversion of user of the land to non agricultural purposes.
the appellant thereafter applied to the court for fixation of standard rent of the plot under 's.11 of the bombay rents, hotel and lodging houses rates control act, 1947.
the 'respondent contended that the land when granted in lease being agriculture i, the provisions of the act did not apply thereto.
the question which arose for decision was whether the plot of land was 'premises ' within the meaning of s.5(8)of the act.
held, that the material date for ascertaining whether the plot is 'premises ' is the date of letting and not the date of the application for fixing the standard rent.
in the present case the plot in dispute could not be regarded as 'premises ' under section 5(8) of the bombay act on the date of letting and the application for fixation of standard rent was not maintainable.
