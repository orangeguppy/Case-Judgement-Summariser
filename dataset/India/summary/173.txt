the appellants, a company registered in india, began in 1940 to sell sewing thread with the device of a bird resembling an eagle with wings fully spread out with the words "eagle brand" as their mark.
on the objection of the respondents the appellants subsequently changed the name to "vulture brand" without changing the mark in other respects.
the respondents instituted an action against the appellants for passing off, but that was dismissed.
the appellats subsequently applied for registration of their trade mark but their application was disraissed by the registrar on the ground that the appellants ' mark so nearly resembled the respondents ' mark as to be likely to deceive the public and cause confusion.
