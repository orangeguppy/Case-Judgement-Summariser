during the assessment year 1962 63, the corresponding accounting year being the financial year ending 31st march, 1962, in respect of goods partly of raw materials and partly of semi finished needles gifted by their collaborators in west germany, the respondent assessee made entries in their books of account for the first time on 30th september 1961, as follows: rs. 44.448.20 debited to the account of 'wire and strip ' and credited to the 'wire and strip gift account ' and rs. 30,000 debited to the account of 'semi processed needles ' and credited to the 'semi processed needles gift account '.
the assessee utilised these goods in the manufacture of finished products and sold the same in the market and the sale proceeds received by the assessee were credited in the trading account maintained in the books account of the business, since they represented revenue receipts arising from the sale of the finished products.
on 31st march 1962, the assessee closed the above two gift, accounts by transferring the respective sums of rs. 41,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ to the credit of the 'capital reserve account ' and debited the aggregate sum of rs. 74,448.20 to the trading account by making corresponding contra credit entries in the accounts of 'wire and strip ' and 'semi processed needles '.
the net effect of these entries was that the profit of the assessee was reduced by rs. 74,448.20.
the income tax officer, in the course of the assessment of the assessee to income tax for the assessment year 1962 63 took the view that the debit of rs. 74,448.20 was wrongly made in the trading account as on 31st march, 1962 since no monies were expended by the assessee in acquiring the raw materials and semi finished needles, but they were received by way of gift from the west german collaborators and hence no amount was deductible in respect of the value of these goods.
the same view was taken by the appellate assistant commissioner in appeal and on further appeal, the tribunal also affirmed the same view.
but the high court on a reference at the instance of the assessee, held that the value of these goods could not be treated as revenue receipt because they `had been received by way of gift and in any event, even if they constituted revenue receipt, they could "in no sense be income" since they were taken out of the ambit of taxability by sub section (3) of section 10 of the income tax act, 1961.
the high court accordingly answered the questions referred by the tribunal in favour of the assessee and against the revenue.
the revenue thereupon brought the present appeal with special leave.
dismissing the appeal, the court ^ held: 1.
the cost of raw materials and semi finished needles received by the assessee from their west german collaborators and introduced in the books of the business could not be said to be 'nil", but it would 372 be their market value as on 30th september 1961.
they were received by the assessee as capital assets and subsequently transferred to the business as part of its stock.

where an assessee converts his capital assets into stock in trade and starts dealing in them, the taxable profit on the sale must be determined by deducting from the sale proceeds the market value at the date of their con version into stock in trade (since this would be the cost to the business) and not the original cost to the assessee.
[375g h. 376a] in the instant case, the original cost of these raw materials and semi finished needles to the assessee was undoubtedly nil because these goods were received by the assessee from the west german collaborators free of cost, but they were introduced in the business and converted into its stock on 30th september, 1961 and, therefore, their market value as on 30th september 1961 would represent the cost to the business and that would have to be taken into account in determining the profit arising from the sale of the manufactured products.
the entries made by the assessee in the books of account of the business on 30th september, 1961 clearly reflected this position.
the assessee debited the sums of rs. 44,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ representing respectively the market value of these raw materials and semi finished needles to the stock accounts of 'wire and strip ' and 'semi processed needles, which would clearly show that these goods were treated by the assessee as having been introduced in the business as part of its stock at their market value represented by the sums of rs. 44,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ [376a d] commissioner of income tax vs shirinbai kooka, 46 i.t.r. (sc) 61; and commissioner of income tax vs hantepara tea co. ltd. 89 i.t.r. (sc) 258; applied 3.
in principle, the position would have been the same if instead of giving raw materials and semi finished articles to the assessee free of cost the west german contractors had gifted sums of money to the assessee and the assessee had introduced these amounts in the business and an identical quantity of raw materials and semi finished products had been purchased for the business with these amounts.
the cost of raw materials and semi finished articles thus purchased would have been clearly liable to be deducted from the sale proceeds of the finished products manufactured out of them in determining the profit of the business.
[3376d f] in the instant case, the cost of the raw materials and semi finished needles.
to the business represented by the sums of rs. 44,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ debited in the respective accounts of 'wire and strip ' and 'semi processed needles ' was liable to be deducted from the sale proceeds of the finished products in arriving at the profit of the business.
it is true that initially on 30th september, 1961 the credit entries for the sums of rs. 44,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ were made in 'wire and strip gift account ' and 'semi processed needles gift account ' respectively and it this only on the last date of the account year, namely, 31st march, 1962 that these amounts were transferred 373 to the credit of the capital reserve account.
but that cannot make and difference to the correct legal inference to be drawn from the proved facts because the nomenclature of the account or accounts in which the credit entries were made is not material but what is really decisive is that these amounts were debited to the respective accounts of 'wire and strip ' and semi processed needles ' as representing their real value on 30th september, 1961.
these raw materials and semi finished needles were introduced in the business as part of its stock at their real value represented by the sums of rs. 44,448.20 and 30,000/ .
the aggregate amount of rs. 74,448.20 made up of rs. 44,448.20 and rs. 30,000/ was, therefore, liable to be deducted in determining the profit of the business and it was rightly debited to the trading account.
