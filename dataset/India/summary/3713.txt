the appellant assessee is a public limited company who spent rs.26,100/ for the construction of a new road for improving transport facilities in the area where its factory is located and sought to deduct this amount from its total income claiming this as revenue expenditure for the year.
the claim was disallowed by the income tax officer and the appellate assistant commissioner.
the appellate tribunal held that the amount could be deducted as revenue expendi ture but at the instance of the respondent referred the matter to the high court under section 256(1) of the income tax act, 1961, where it was decided against the appellant.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: the line of demarcation between capital expendi ture and revenue expenditure has been found to be very thin.
according to the test suggested in atherton 's case by vis count cave, l.c. by having the new road constructed for the improvement of transport facilities, the assessee acquired an enduring advantage for its business.
the expenditure incurred was, therefore of a capital nature.
