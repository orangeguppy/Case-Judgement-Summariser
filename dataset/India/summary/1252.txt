the government filed a suit on the basis of a security bond executed by a government treasurer and certain sureties who joined in the execution of the bond.
the contention in defence, inter alia, was that article 149 of the indian limitation act prescribing a 60 years period of limitation for suits by the government was unconstitutional as violative of article 14 of the constitution and as such the suit was barred under article 83.
held, that statutes of limitation are designed for the bene ficent public purpose of preventing the taking away from one what he has been permitted to consider his own for a long time and on the faith of which he plans his future life.
if the suit was by a private individual the suit would have fallen under article 83 and would have been barred by it but different considerations arise in the case of the state and there is a distinction between claims by the government and those of private individuals.
article 149 of the limitation act, 1908, which fixes a period of 60 years for suits by the government has a reasonable basis of classification between the government and private individuals, and the exact period that should be allowed to the government to file a suit would be a matter of legislative policy and as such its constitutional validity cannot be questioned under article 14 of the constitution.
