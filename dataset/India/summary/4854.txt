the petitioner was convicted for an offence under section 307 and section 459 of the indian penal code and sentenced on february 1, 1980 to a term of rigorous imprisonment.
during the pendency of the trial the petitioner was in judicial custody with effect from january 11, 1980 in another case f.i.r. 315/78 under sections 457/380/411 of the indian penal code which also ended in his conviction on february 16, 1981 and was sentenced for a term of rigorous imprisonment.
in the latter case it was ordered that the petitioner was entitled to the set off as provided by section 428 of the code.
the petitioner claimed that in spite of his conviction in the earlier case from february 1, 1980 he was entitled for set off from 11.1.1980 to 16.2.81.
the question in the present writ petition is whether such a claim is in order.
dismissing the writ petition, the court ^ held: 1.

section 428 of the code of criminal procedure 1973 was introduced with the object of remedying the unsatisfactory state of affairs that was prevail 725 ing when the former code of 1898 was in force.
it was then found that many persons were being detained in prison at the pre conviction stage for unduly long periods, many times for periods longer than the actual sentence of imprisonment that could be imposed on them on conviction.

in order to secure the benefit of section 428 of the code, the prisoner should show that he had been detained in prison for the purpose of investigation inquiry or trial of the case in which he is later on convicted and sentenced.
it follows that if a person is undergoing the sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of law on being convicted of an offence in one case during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial of some other case, he cannot claim that the period occupied by such investigation, inquiry or trial should be set off against the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed in the latter case even though he had been detained during such period.
in such a case the period of detention is really a part of the period of imprisonment which he is undergoing having been sentenced earlier for another offence.
it is not the period of detention undergone by him during the investigation, inquiry or trial of the same case in which he is later on convicted and sentenced to undergo imprisonment.
he cannot claim a double benefit under section 428 of the code that is the same period being counted as part of the period of imprisonment imposed for committing the former offence and also being set off against the period of imprisonment imposed for committing the latter offence as well.
the instruction issued by the high court of punjab & haryana no. 29442 rules vi.
