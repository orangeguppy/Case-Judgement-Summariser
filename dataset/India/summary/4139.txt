there was no evidence as to any overt act, except the presence of the second appellant along with the third accused.

the mere fact that the police had reasons to suspect that the witness might be gained over and that it was expedient to have their statements recorded by the magistrate, would not make the statements of the witnesses thus recorded tainted.

if the witness resiles from the statement given by him under section 164 in the committal court, the witness can be cross examined on his earlier statement.
but if he sticks to the statement given by him under section 164 before committal enquiry and resiles from it in the sessions court, the procedure prescribed under section 288, code of criminal procedure will have to be observed.
it is for the court to consider taking into account all the circumstances including the fact that the witness had resiled, in coming to the conclusion as to whether the witness should be believed or not.
the fact that the police had section 164 statement recorded by the magistrate would not by itself make his evidence tainted.
