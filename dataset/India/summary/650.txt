the petitioners, who were land owners of himachal pradesh, challenged the constitutional validity of the himachal pradesh abolition of big landed estates and land reforms act, 1953 (himachal 15 of 1954), said to have been passed by the legislative assembly of the state of himachal pradesh functioning under the himachal pradesh and bilaspur (new state) act (32 of 1954).
the impugned act was introduced as a bill in the first session of the legislative assembly of the old himachal pradesh elected under the government of part c states act (49 of 1951).
before the bill could be passed, the himachal pradesh and bilaspur (new state) act (32 of 1954) came into force on july 1, 1954, abolishing the old act and uniting the two states into one.
while the legislative assembly for the new state was yet to be constituted, on july 7, 1954, the governor issued the following notification, " the lieutenant governor, in exercise of.
the powers conferred by section 9 of the (49 of 1951), has been pleased to direct that the second session, 1954, of the himachal pradesh legislative assembly will commence from monday, the 16th august, 1954, at 9 30 a.m. in the council chamber, simla 4.
" it was at this session that the impugned act was passed.
its provisions were said to be drastic and to infringe articles 14, 19 and 31 of the constitution.
it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that apart from violating those articles, the impugned act was void as it had not been passed by a duly constituted legislature.
it was sought to be contended on behalf of the respondent that under the new act the members of the old legislative assembly must be deemed to constitute the legislature for the new state and it was as such called by the governor.
held, that the contention raised by the respondent was with out substance and must be negatived.
it was apparent that the so called assembly which the governor had convened and which purported to pass the impugned act was not the legislative assembly of the new state constituted under the himachal pradesh and bilaspur (new state) act (32 of 1954) and as such the act could not be regarded as a valid piece of legislation.
