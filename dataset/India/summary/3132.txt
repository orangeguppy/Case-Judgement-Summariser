the assessee, who was carrying on business in malaya which was within the war zone, suffered damages to property during the war on account of bombing.
the loss in question was loss of stock in trade.
on the question whether the loss could be given deduction to as a business loss in computing the net income of assessee under section 10 (1) of the income tax act, 1922.
held : on the facts and circumstance of the case the loss occurred must be taken to be a loss incidental to the business carried on by the assessee during the war.
if the assessee had earned any profits cut of his business during the war the department undoubtedly have to consider those profits as assessable income.
when loss had occurred in such situation the department cannot contend that the loss in question must not be a business loss.
a loss of stock in trade occasioned by enemy action must be considered as a trade loss.
