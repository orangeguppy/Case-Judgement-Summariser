bern chand, his third wife and her children were excluded from the will.
beni chand opposed the probate of the will contending that it was a forgery and challenged the execution of the will.

dismissing the appeal, the court held: (1) the mere description of a signatory to a testamentary document as an attesting witness cannot take the place of evidence showing due execution of the document.
an attesting witness is one who signs the document in the presence of the executant after seeing the execution of the document or after receiving a personal acknowledgment from the executant as regards the execution of the document.
[581h. 582a] (2) the onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will, and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator.
where the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will are shrouded in suspi cion, it is the duty and function of the propounder to remove that suspicion by leading satisfactory evidence, and by offering an explanation of auspicious circumstances which can satisfy a prudent mind.
