the respondent was appointed assistant sub inspector of police with effect from january 17, 1929, and on his own representation his date of birth was entered in the service record as july 1, 1910.
under f.r. 56(a) he was liable to be compulsorily retired on july 1, 1965. 'in 1963 he applied that the date of birth in the service record may be corrected as.
august 1, 1911.
the application was rejected without giving him an opportunity to support his case and he was informed on june 26, 1965.
that he would stand superannuated on june 30, 1965.
he filed a writ petition in the high court and the high court quashed the order dated june 26, 1965.
in appeal to this court held : until the service record of a public servant is corrected he cannot claim that he has been deprived of the guarantee under article 311(2) of the constitution by being compulsorily retired on attaining the age of superannuation on the basis of the service record.
a public servant may dispute the correctness of the date of birth as entered in the service record and may apply for its correction, but in view of s.r. 8 note, which governed the employment of the respondent, an application for such a correction could not be entertained if it was made within three years before the date of 'actual superannuation '.
the words 'actual superannuation ' mean the date of superannuation according to the service record, and not according to the date of birth claimed by the public servant.
the respondent represented that he had attained the age of majority on the date on which he entered service.
it was not open to him to contend that under the appropriate service rule he could not have been admitted to the service.
