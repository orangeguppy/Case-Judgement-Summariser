the appellants plaintiffs instituted a suit for declaration of title and delivery of possession of immovable properties.

the effect of section 80 cpc prior to its amendment by act 104 of 1976 is clearly to impose a bar against the institution of a suit against the government or a public officer in respect of any act purported to be done by him in his official capacity until the expiration of two months after notice has been delivered.
there is clearly a public purpose underlying this mandatory provision.

the examination of the scheme of the section reveals that the section has been enacted as a measure of public policy with the object of ensuring that before a suit is instituted against the government or a public officer, the government or the officer concerned is afforded an opportunity to scrutinise the claim in respect of which the suit is proposed to be filed and if it be found to be a just claim, to take immediate action and thereby avoid unnecessary litigation and save public time and money by settling the claim without driving the person who issued the notice, to institute the suit involving considerable expenditure and delay.

when the language used in the statute is clear and unambiguous it is the plain duty of the court to give effect to it and considerations of hardship will not be a legitimate ground for not faithfully implementing the mandate of the legislature.
