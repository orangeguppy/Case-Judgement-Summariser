the appellants belonging to the revenue department of gujarat state were allocated to the panchayat service when the gujarat panchayats act, 1961 came into force and their allocation became final under section 206a(2) of the act.
thereafter they went on deputation as circle inspectors in the state service but were later reverted back to their parent cadre in the panchayat service.
the appellants challenged their reversion before the high court which dismissed the petition.
hence this appeal.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
it is clear from section 206a(2) of the gujarat panchayats act, 1961 that a panchayat servant who is not reallocated within a period of four years from the coming into force of the act would be deemed to be finally allocat ed to the panchayat service.
the high court has held that the appellants have not been able to show that they made any such options before the specified date.
even if the appel lant gave some sort of option the same having not been accepted before the expiry of specified date, the appellants stood finally allocated to the panchayat service.
[416b c] 2.
the appellants being on deputation they could be reverted to their parent cadre at any time and they do not get any right to be absorbed on the deputation post.
there is no infirmity in the judgment of the high court.
