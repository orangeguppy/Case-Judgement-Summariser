in a suit in which the appellant was defendant, after the plaintiff 's evidence was over, the defendant was to begin his evidence on 24th january, 1985.
as no witness was present, at the request of defendant 's counsel the case was adjourned to 7th may, 1985.
on that day, the case was trans ferred to another court and the transferee court ordered the case to be put up on 21st august, 1985.
it being a holiday, the case was put up on 22nd august, 1985 when it was ad journed to 30th october, 1985.
on that day, no one was present for the defendant.
the case was again taken up at 1 p.m. but the situation remained the same.
since none of the witnesses for defendant was also present, evidence was closed and case fixed for arguments for 1st november 1985.
on this date also nobody appeared for the defendant and the case was adjourned to 8th november, 1985.
on that day, arguments of the plaintiff 's counsel were heard and as none was present for defendant, the case was fixed for judgment on 11th november, 1985.
on this date also nobody was present for defendant and since judgment was not ready it was post poned to 21st november, 1985.
on this date the judgment was dictated, pronounced and decree was ordered to be prepared.
the defendant filed an application under order 9 rule 13 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 for setting aside ex parte decree urging that he came to know about decree on 18th january, 1986 when the plaintiff came to take posses sion.
the trial court dismissed the application holding that it was not maintainable because the case was disposed of not in accordance with order 17 rule 2, but in accordance with order 17 rule 3.
an application for review was also dis missed by the trial court.
the first appeal too was summari ly dismissed by the high court.
allowing the appeal, 289 held: 1.
the order passed by the high court and also the trial court rejecting the application of the appellant under order 9 rule 13 of the civil procedure code 1908 are set aside and the trial court is directed to dispose of the application in accordance with law.
[294c] 2.
in cases where a party is absent, only course is as mentioned in order 17(3)(b) to proceed under rule 2.
the language of amended rule 2 also lays down that if any one of the parties fails to appear, the court has to proceed to dispose of the suit in one of the modes directed under order 9.
the explanation to rule 2 gives a discretion to the court to proceed under rule 3 even if a party is absent but that discretion is limited only in case where a party which is absent has led some evidence or has examined substantial part of their evidence.
therefore, if on a date fixed, one of the parties remains absent and for that party no evidence has been examined upto that date the court has no option but to proceed to dispose of the matter in accordance with order 17 rule 2 in any one of the modes prescribed under order 9 of the code of civil procedure.
after this amendment in order 17 rules 2 and 3 in 1976 there remains no doubt, and therefore, there is no possibility of any controversy.
[292h 293c] 3.
in the present case, on 30th october 1985 when the case was called nobody was present for the defendant, and till that date the plaintiff 's evidence had been recorded but no evidence for defendant was recorded.
the defendant was only to begin on this date or an earlier date when the case was adjourned.
it is, therefore, clear that upto 30th october 1985 when the trial court closed the case of defend ant there was no evidence on record on his behalf.
there fore, the explanation to order 17 rule 2 was not applicable at all.
apparently when the defendant was absent order 17 rule 2 only permitted the court to proceed to dispose of the matter in any one of the modes provided under order 9.
[293d e] 4.
order 17 rule 3 as it stands was not applicable to the facts of this case as admittedly on the date when the evidence of the defendant was closed nobody appeared for the defendant and, therefore, the court when it proceeded to dispose of the suit on merits had committed an error.
even on the review application, the trial court went on in the controversy about order 17 rules 2 and 3 which existed before the amendment and rejected the review application and on appeal, the high court also unfortunately dismissed the appeal in limine by one word.
