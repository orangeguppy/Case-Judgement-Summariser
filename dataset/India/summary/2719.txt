in deciding whether a temple is private or public, courts have to address themselves to various questions such as: (1) is the temple built in such imposing manner that it may prima facie appear to be a public temple ? (2) are the members of the public entitled to worship in that temple as of right ? (3) are the temple expenses met from the. contributions made by the public ? (4) whether the sevas and utsavas conducted in the temple are those usually conducted in public temples ? (5) have the management as well as the devotees been treating the temple as a public temple.
though the appearance of a temple is a relevant circumstance, it is by no means 'a decisive one.
the architecture of temples differs from place to place.
the circumstance that the public or a section thereof have been regularly worshiping in the. temple as a matter of course and they can take part in the festivals 'and ceremonies conducted in that temple apparently as a matter of right is a strong piece of evidence to establish the public character of the temple.
if votive offerings are being made by the public in the usual course and if the expenses of the temple are met by public contribution, it is safe to presume that the temple question is a public temple.
in brief the origin of the temple.
, the manner in which its affairs are managed, the nature and extent of gifts received by it, rights exercised by the devotees in regard to worship therein, the consciousness of the manager and the consciousness of the devotees themselves as to the public character of the temple are factors that go to establish whether a temple is public temple or a private temple.
