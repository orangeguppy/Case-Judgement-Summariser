the appellants were prosecuted for dishonestly cutting and removing the paddy crop of the complainant.
the complaint was filed 8 days after, the incident.
the trial court convicted them.
the appellate court acquitted them on the grounds.
: (1) that the prosecution witnesses were unreliable; (2) that there was considerable delay in filing the complaint for which no explanation was given; and (3) the inspector of police who was alleged to have been an eye witness of the occurrence was not examined.
the complainant filed an appeal to the high court under s.417(3) cr.
during the pendency of the appeal the complainant died.
the high court set aside the acquittal and convicted the appellants.
in appeal to this court, held : (i) the question of abatement of criminal appeals is., dealt with by s.431 cr. p.c., and according to that section an appeal under s.417 can only abate on the death of the accused and not otherwise.
therefore, once the appeal against acquittal is entertained by the high court, it becomes its duty to decide it on merits even though the com plainant died.
[842 g h] thothan vs murugan, a.i.r. 1958 mad. 624, overruled.
(ii) unless the conclusion that the accused were not guilty, reached by the first appellate court, was palpably wrong, or was based on an erroneous view of the law or that the decision was likely to result in grave injustice, the high court should be reluctant to interfere with that conclusion.
if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record then the view in support of the acquittal of the accused should be preferred.
[840 h, 841 a] (iii) in the present case, the prosecution witnesses were obviously , interested witnesses being the enemies of the accused, and the explanations given by the complainant for the delay in filing the complaint and the non examination of the inspector of police were false, therefore, the high court erred in interfering with the order of acquittal.
