the appellant as the mahant of the salouna asthal made an application in the high court under article 226 of the constitution praying inter alia for the issue of a writ quashing the order of the bihar state board of religious trusts requiring the appellant to submit a return of income and expenditure under section 59 of the bihar hindu religious trusts act, 1950, on the grounds, inter alia, that the salouna as that was a private institution and not a religious trust within the meaning of the act and that the act did not apply to private trusts.
the high court took the view that the language of section 2(1) of the act, which defined a " religious trust ", was wide enough to cover within its ambit both private and public trusts recognised by hindu law and that the salouna asthal did not come within any of the two exceptions recognised by the section.
held, that on a true and proper construction of the provi sions of the act, considered in the background of previous legislative history with regard to religious, charitable or pious trusts in india, the definition clause in section 2(1) of the act does not include within its ambit private trusts and that the provisions of the act do not apply to such trusts.
the essential distinction in hindu law between religious endowments which are public and those which are private is that in a public trust the beneficial interest is vested in an uncertain and fluctuating body of persons, either the public at large or some considerable portion of it answering a particular description ; in a private trust the beneficiaries are definite and ascertained individuals or who within a time can be definitely ascertained.
the fact that the uncertain and fluctuating body of persons is a section of the public following as particular religious faith or is only a sect of persons of a certain religious persuasion would not make any difference in the matter and would not make the trust a 'private trust.
