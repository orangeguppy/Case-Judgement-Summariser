the purpose of law and justice (dharma) is promotion of cohesion and not production of fission.
a judgment often possesses a sublime essence and a humdrum component.
the sublime element consists in the optimistic endeavour to bring parties together so that the litigation may not cut them as under, especially when they are blood relations like sisters.
the present appeal in its happy conclusion, holds out the higher lesson that hate and fight are dissolved by basic human fellowship, even after bitter litigative struggle, if the bench and the bar pursue consensual justice and bring into play conciliatory processes and successfully persuade the parties to see reason and right beyond bare law.

the respondent 's mother who inherited her husband 's estate died after the coming into force of the 1956 act.
the high court dismissed the appellant 's claim for a half share in the properties under section 15(1)(a) of the act.
the specific point of claim, whether a son and daughter in the setting of section 15(1)(a) of the act, includes step son and step daughter or embraces only the son and daughter of the deceased female propositus, has escaped the parliament 's attention while passing the legislation.
[at the court 's suggestion the parties came to a compromise assisted by counsel on both sides.] 640 tulzapurkar, j. parliament should clarify its intention regarding section 15(1)(a) of the act. ^
