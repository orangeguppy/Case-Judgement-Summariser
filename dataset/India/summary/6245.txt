the uttar pradesh public service commission conducted recruitment examination to the post of upper zila basic shiksha adhikari (women) in two stages written test and interview.
the commission cancelled the entire recruitment examination for re holding it, after it was found that due to improper feeding into the computer candidates who secured lesser marks in the written examination were interviewed and finally selected while candidates who had better performance were not called for interview.
writ petitions challenging the action of the commission were dismissed by the high court.
hence these appeals.
allowing the appeals and setting aside the judgment of the high court, this court, held: when no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to exclusion of a group of successful candidates in the written examination from the interview, there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examina tion.
[125g] the situation on the other hand could have been appro priately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and selection of those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.
