the property in dispute was granted in inam to the ancestors of the predecessors in interest of the plaintiff respondents for the performance of parak service in certain temples but the grantees alienated considerable portion of the property and ceased to perform the parak service.
on being moved by the trustees under section 44 b(2)(a)(i) and (ii) of the madras hindu religious endowments act, 1927, the revenue authorities after holding an enquiry ordered resumption of the inam lands and regranted them to the temple.
the alienees thereupon filed a suit in which their main contention was that the revenue authorities had no jurisdiction to order the resumption of the inam under s.44 b of the act which is in these terms "any exchange, gift, sale or mortgage and any lease for a term exceeding five years, of the whole or any portion of any inam granted for the performance of a charity or service connected with a math or temple and made, confirmed or recognised by the british government, shall be null and void.
" both the trial court and the high court on appeal held that the inam was a personal inam burdened with service to the temple and the case did not fall under section 44 b of the act.
on appeal by the trustees with a certificate of the high court, held, that the distinction between a grant for an office to be remunerated by the use of land and a grant of land burdened with service is that the former is a case of service grant and is resumable when the service is not performed; the latter is not a service grant as such but a grant in favour of a person though burdened with service and its resumption will depend upon whether the circumstances in which the grant was made establish a condition that it was resumable if the service was not performed.
shrimant lakhamgouda vs raosaheb baswantrao, (1931) lxi m.l.j. 449, referred to.
though on a wide interpretation section 44 b(1) might also include personal inams burdened with service it is really confined to inams directly granted to the temple or service inams for the purpose of a temple or math or inams the whole income of which is meant for charity and does not include personal inams burdened with service.
such inams would continue to be dealt with under board 's standing order 54 class (b) as introduced by the amendment to that order.
