the petitioners claimed to he casual labourers of the south eastern railway appointed between 1964 69 and retrenched between 1975 78.
they prayed (1) for inclusion of their names in the live casual register and reemployment according to their seniority, and (2) for restraining the filling of vacancies from the open market.
they relied on two circulars issued by the railway board laying down guidelines for the recruitment, retrenchment and employment of casual labourers.
they also relied on two judgments of this court in 1985 and 1987 which directed the preparation of a scheme and absorption of casual labourers in accordance with their scheme.
a scheme was framed in 1987 for employing casual labourers retrenched before 1981 subject to demonstrating suitability before 31st march, 1987.
in 1990 the petitioners made their representation to be considered.
the questions before this court were (a) whether the petitioners were entitled as a matter of law to reemployment and (b) if they had lost their right, if any, due to delay.
