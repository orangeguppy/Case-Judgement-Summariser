the appellant 's answer to the omnibus question under section 342, criminal procedure code, without giving him an intimation of the offence of which he was likely to be convicted, on the face of it, was quite reasonable and credible.
the prosecution had been unable to repel the effect of this fairly acceptable explanation.
the explanation which the appellant had given was good enough to raise serious doubts about the susceptibility of a charge under section 411, indian penal code.
the principle of benefit of doubt on questions of fact applies whether the verdict is of a jury or the finding is to be given by a judge or a magistrate.[751,ab.e h] otto george gfeller vs the king, air 1943 pc 211 @ 214
