held, (i) that the ordinary and primary jurisdiction of the labour appellate tribunal constituted under the industrial disputes (appellate tribunal) act, 1950 is appellate; (ii) that section 22 of the act confers on the appellate tribunal a special jurisdiction which is in the nature of original jurisdiction; (iii) that section 23 also vests in the tribunal an additional jurisdiction to decide the complaint as if it were an appeal pending before it; and (iv) that section 23 confers on the 1242 workmen an additional remedy which they did not have under the .
the two now sections 33 and 33 a inserted in the industrial di putes act 1947 (xiv of 1947) by act xlviii of 1950 confer distinct benefits on the workmen and give some additional jurisdiction and power to the authorities mentioned therein.

a ban has been put by section 22 of 1950 act and section 33 of the 1947 act upon the ordinary right, which the employer has under the ordinary law governing a contract of employment with a view to protect the workmen against victimisation by the employer and to ensure the termination.of the proceedings in connection with industrial disputes in a peaceful atmosphere and the only thing that the authority is called upon to do is to grant or withhold the permission i.e. to lift or maintain the ban.
these sections do not confer any power on the authorities to adjudicate upon any other dispute.

under section 33 a of the and section 23 of the 1950 act the jurisdiction of the authority is not only to decide whether there has been a failure on the part of the employer to obtain the permission of the authority before taking action but also to give a decision on the merits of an industrial dispute and grant appropriate relief which when published by the appropriate government will become enforceable under the respective acts.
