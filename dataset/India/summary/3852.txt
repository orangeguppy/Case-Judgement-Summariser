"shahabad stones" are included under item 15 in schedule i to rule 10 of the andhra pradesh minor mineral concession rules 1966.
the appellants, who are directors of tandur and navandgi stone quarries (pvt.) ltd. and holders of mining lease for extraction of lime stones (shahabad stones when being prosecuted, for the alleged violation of rule 21(1)(ii) of the mineral conservation and development rules, 1958 which is made punishable under rules 27 of the said rules in that they failed to employ a qualified geologist or a mining engineer, raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the complaint in view of the specific exclusion of the "shahabad stones" from the purview of the 1958 rules, being a minor mineral being used for building and construction purposes.
the trial magistrate dismissed the application and the high court declined to interfere under section 48 of the criminal procedure code, 1973.
dismissing the appeal by special leave the court, ^ held: as the high court does not ordinarily interfere at an interlocutory stage of a criminal proceedings pending in a subordinate court, the a.p. high court was right in declining to grant relief to the appellants, bearing in mind the well recognised principles of law governing the matter and taking into consideration the nature of the impugned order.
it is also not a matter in which supreme court may legitimately interfere in exercise of their extra ordinary powers under article 136 of the constitution especially when the case at its threshold and evidence has still to be adduced as to whether the minerals extracted could or could not be used as a major mineral for certain purposes.
it is not possible to determine difficult question of the kind involved in the instant case, purely in abstract without relevant evidence bearing on the matter in issue.
