on the question raised by the petitioners that placing of obstructions on highways so as to impede free flow of traffic was per se unlawful, ^ held: no one is entitled to barricade a highway so as to prevent members of the public from using it while they are od their lawful business in the pursuit of normal avocations of life.
but the police, whose duty it is to enforce law and order in the wake of threatened mass agitations which are reasonably likely to lead to breach of public peace, are entitled in the discharge of that duty to impose reasonable restraints on the physical movement of members of the public to protect public property and to avoid needless inconvenience to other citizens in their lawful pursuits.

they must be minimal and cannot exceed constraints of the particular situation, either in nature or in duration.
above all, they cannot he used as engines of oppression, persecution, harassment or the like.
the sanctity of person and of privacy has to be maintained at all costs and that cannot ever be violated under the guise of maintenance of law and 1 order.
the rule of law requires that no person shall be subjected to harsh, uncivilized or discriminatory treatment even when the objective is the securing of the paramount exigencies of law and order.
