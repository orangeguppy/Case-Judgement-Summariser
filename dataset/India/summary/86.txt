resort to sec.
145 of the evidence act is necessary only if a witness denies that he made the former statement.
in that event it would be necessary to prove that he did and if the former statement was reduced to writing, then sec.
145 requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction.
but that position does not arise when the witness admits the former statement.
in such a case all that is necessary is to look to the former statement of which no further proof is necessary because of the admission ' that it was made.
the former statement cannot be used as substantive evidence unless sec.
288, criminal procedure code, is called in aid but even without sec.
288 the court would be entitled to say, basing on the evidence in chief which is the substantive evidence, that what the witness said to the police or the committing magistrate, is the true version, not because those state ments form substantive evidence, but because they tally with the evidence in chief which is substantive.
if a former statement can be brought in under sec.
157 of the evidence act, it can be transmuted into substantive evidence by the application of sec.
288 of the criminal procedure code.
