the appellant government passed an order under section 99 a of the cr.
p.c., for the forfeiture of a book entitled 'ramayan: a true reading ' in english and its translation in hindi, by periyar evr, of tamil nadu, on the ground that the book intended to outrage the religious feelings of a class of citizens of india, namely, the hindus.
thereupon, an application was made by the respondent publisher of the book.
under section 99 c of the code to the high court, which by its special bench, allowed the application and quashed the notification on the ground that the state gov ernment had failed to state the grounds of its opinion as required in section 99 a of the code.
the appellant contended that a specific statement of grounds by the government, is not a mandatory requirement under section 99 a of the cr.
p.c., & that it can be made by implication.
dismissing the appeal, the court held: to relieve the state from the duty to state grounds of forfeiture, is to permit raptorial opportunity for use of such power over people 's guaranteed liberty.
section 99 a says that you must state the ground and it is no answer to say that they need not be stated because they are implied.
an order may be brief but not a blank.
a formal authoritative setting forth of the grounds is statu torily mandatory.
section 99 c .enables the aggrieved party to apply to the high court to set aside the prohibitory order and the court examines the grounds of government given in the order.
the court cannot make a roving enquiry beyond the grounds sefforth in the order and if the grounds are altogether left out, the valuable right of appeal to the court is defeated.
