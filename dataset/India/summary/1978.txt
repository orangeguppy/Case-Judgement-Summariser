the respondent company was directed to be wound up and an official liquidator appointed by an order of the high court in october, 1950.
in december, 1950, the respondent was assessed to tax amounting to rs. 3737/ for the year 1948 49.
a claim made for this tax on the official liquidator was adjudged and allowed as an ordinary claim and certified as such in april, 1952.
the liquidator declared a dividend of 91/2 annas in the rupee in august, 1954 and paid a sum of rs. 5188 to the department, leaving a balance of rs. 3549.
in june, 1954.
the department made a demand from the respondent and was paid rs. 2565 as advance tax for the year 1955 56.
on a regular assessment being made for that year, only rs. 1126 was assessed as payable, so that a sum of rs. 1460, inclusive of interest, became refundable to the respondent.
however, the income tax officer, purporting to exercise the power available to him under section 49e of the income tax act, 1922, set off this amount against the balance of rs. 3549 due for the year 194849.
a revision petition filed by respondent in respect of this set off was rejected by the commissioner of income tax.
thereafter, a petition under article 226 filed by the respondent to set aside the orders of the income tax officer and the commissioner was allowed by the high court, mainly on the ground that the demand for rs. 8737 in respect of 1948 49, being adjudged and certified came to have all the incidents and character of an unsecured debt payable by the liquidator to the department; it was therefore governed by the provisions of company law and no other remedy or method to obtain satisfaction of the claim was available to the creditor.
in the appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that section 49e gave statutory power to income tax officer to set off a refundable amount against any tax remaining payable and that this power was not subject to any provision of any other law.
held:the income tax officer was in error in applying section 49e and setting off the refund due to the respondent.
[683c d] the effect of sections 228 and 229 of the companies act, 1913, is, inter alia, that an unsecured creditor must prove his debts and all unsecured debts are to be paid part passu.
once the claim of the department has to be proved and is proved in liquidation proceedings, it 680 cannot, by exercising the right under section 49e get priority over the other unsecured creditors and thus defeat the very object of sections 228 and 229 of the companies act.
furthermore, if there is an apparent conflict between two independant provisions of law, the special provision must prevail.
section 49e is a general provision applicable to all assessees in all circumstances; sections 228 and 229 deal with proof of does and their payment in liquidation.
section 49e can be reconciled with sections 228 and 229 by holding that section 49e applies when insolpency rules do not apply.
