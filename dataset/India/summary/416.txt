the appellants were members of a procession taken out to protest against the policy of the punjab government to nationalise motor transport and raised the slogans "jaggu mama hai hai (jaggu, maternal uncle be dead)" and "khachar khota hai hai (mule cumdonkey be dead)".
the words were directed against the transport minister and the chief minister respectively and were defamatory.
the appellants were prosecuted and convicted under section 9 of the punjab security of the state act, 1953.
held that the statements could not be said to undermine the security of the state or friendly relations with foreign states nor did they amount to contempt of court or defamation prejudicial to the security of the state nor did they tend to overthrow the state and that the prosecution had failed to establish that the act of the appellants undermined public order, decency or morality or was tant amount to an incitement to an offence prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and consequently the prosecution under section 9 was not justified.
public men may as well think it worth their while to ignore such vulgar criticisms and abuses hurled against them, rather than give importance to the same by prosecuting the person responsible for the same.
