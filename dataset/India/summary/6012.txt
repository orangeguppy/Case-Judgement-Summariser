a decree in favour of the respondent husband was grant ed by the trial court declaring his marriage with the appella nt to be a nullity under section 12(1)(d) of the hindu marria ge act, 1956 on the ground that the wife at the time of ma r riage was pregnant by some one other than the respondent.
in the appeal filed by the appellant, the respondent raised a preliminary objection contending that the appeal was n ot tenable and had been rendered infructuous because he h ad re married before the filing of the appeal.
the appella te court allowed the preliminary objection and dismissed t he appeal, and the high court dismissed the second appeal.
before this court it was contended on behalf of t he appellant that (i) the word 'divorce ' has been used in section 15 in a broader sense and, in view of the langua ge used in that section, it is not possible to distingui sh between a decree of nullity under section 11 or 12 a nd decree of divorce under section 13; (ii) the interpretati on put by the lower courts, on the basis of judgments of so me of the high courts, that section 15 will not apply to a decree under section 12 but would only apply when there is a decree under section 13, does not appear to be correct as the scope and language of section 15 coupled with the la n guage of section 28, had not been considered by any one of these courts; and (iii) even if it is held that section 15 applies to a decree under section 12, the respondent h ad re married after the period of limitation had expired, as the provisions of the will not apply in vi ew of the section 29(3) of that act, and therefore the period 138 for obtaining copies of the judgment excluded under secti on 12 clause will not be available to the appellant.
allowing the appeal, it was, held: (1) it is no doubt true that section 12 and se c tion 13 have different phraseology.
in section 12 it is sa id that the "marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullit y" whereas in section 13, the phraseology used is "dissolved by a decree of divorce".
though in substance the meaning of t he two may be different under the circumstances and on t he facts of each case, but the legal meaning or the effect, is that by intervention of the court the relationship betwe en two spouses has been severed either in accordance with t he provisions of section 12 or in accordance with the prov i sions of section 13.
probably it is because of this reas on that the phrase 'decree of nullity ' and 'decree of divorc e ' have not been defined.
[143a b] (2) under the provisions of section 28 all decrees ma de by the court in any proceeding under this act are appea l able.
in order to provide an appeal against all decre es section 28 has used a very wide terminology which includ es decrees under sections 11, 12 and 13, and so far as this is concerned it could hardly be contested as the language of section 28 itself is so clear.
[143g h] (3) if it is accepted that section 15 will not apply to cases when a decree is passed under section 11 or 12, it will mean that as soon as a decree is passed the par ty aggrieved may appeal but the other party by remarriage wou ld make the appeal infructuous and therefore the right of appeal of one of the parties to the decree under section 28 will be subject to the act of the other party in cases whe re decree is passed under section 11 or 12.
but if it were s o, the legislature would have provided a separate provision f or appeal when there is a decree under section 13 and a diffe r ent provision for appeal when there is a decree under se c tion 11 or 12 as the right of appeal against a decree und er section 11 or 12 could only be a limited right subject to the desire of the other party.
[144h; 145a b] (4) the legislature in its wisdom had enacted section 28 conferring a right of appeal which is unqualified, unr e strictive and not depending on the mercy or desire of a party against all decrees in any proceeding under the ac t.
hence, the only interpretation which could be put on t he language of section 15 should be that which will be consis t ent with section 28.
therefore, the phrase 'marriage h as been dissolved 139 by a decree of divorce ' in section 15 will only mean whe re the relationship of marriage has been brought to an end by the process of court by a decree, which will include a decree under section 11, 12 or 13.
the view taken by t he courts below is accordingly not sustainable.
