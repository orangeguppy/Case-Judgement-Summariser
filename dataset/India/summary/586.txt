the respondent, a sub inspector of police, was charged with acceptance of rs. 100 as a bribe from two persons, b and p, for dropping a case which he had instituted against b under the essential supplies (temporary powers) act, 1946.
the prosecution case was that when the demand for the bribe made by the respondent could not be avoided, b and p approached the anticorrosive department, and it was arranged that the respondent should be paid at the police station the bribe money in the shape of currency notes produced by b and p and initialled by m, who was in charge of the anti corruption department, and that m, along with a deputy superintendent of the department and a first class magistrate, should be at the police station at the time of payment, dressed as ordinary villagers ; that as soon as the amounts in notes were received by the respondent the officers disclosed their identity, that thereupon the respondent tried to throw away the currency notes but that as a result of the officers catching hold of his hands the notes were found in his hand except one which was missing and that as a result of a search made in the presence of two search witnesses later the missing note was also found.
the respondent was tried by the special judge who accepted the prosecution evidence and found him guilty of the offence under section 161 of the indian penal code.
on appeal to the high court the learned single judge who disposed of the appeal held that the respondent could not be convicted because (1) there was no independent witness to support the testimony of the " raiding party " consisting of the two bribegivers and the three officers, (2) the search witnesses did not prove the transaction nor were they present at the time of the occur rence, and (3) the decision in rao shiv bahadur singh vs state of vindhya pradesh, , had laid down an invariable rule that in cases of this nature the testimony of those witnesses who form what is called " the raiding party " must be discarded, unless that testimony is corroborated by independent witnesses.
the state appealed by special leave : held, (1) that the evidence of the two search witnesses provided independent corroboration in a material particular to 196 the testimony of the raiding party, because the missing currency note, one of the series testified to by the raiding party, could be found where it was actually found only if the testimony of the raiding party was true.
(2)that corroboration need not be by direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient even though it is merely by circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
rameshwar vs the state of rajasthan, ; , followed.
(3)that the decision in rao shiv bahadur singh vs state of vindhya pradesh, , has not laid down any inflexible rule that the evidence of the witnesses of the raiding party must be discarded in all cases in the absence of any independent corroboration.
the correct rule is that if any of the witnesses are accom plices, their evidence is admissible in law but the judge must warn the jury of the danger of convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice ; if the case is tried without the aid of a jury, the judge should indicate in his judgment that he had this rule of caution in mind and give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration; if, however, the witnesses are not accomplices but are merely partisan or interested witnesses, who are concerned in the success of the trap, their evidence must be tested in the same way as any other interested evidence is tested, and in a proper case, the court may look for independent corroboration before convicting the accused person.
if a magistrate puts himself in the position of a partisan or interested witness, he cannot claim any higher status and must be treated as any other interested witness.
