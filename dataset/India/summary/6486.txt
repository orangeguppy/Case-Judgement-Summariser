appellant joined state government service, as paid apprentice on 1.7.1937.
he held various posts and was pro moted to the permanent post of copyist on 1.8.1941.
in march, 1943 he came to government of india service on depu tation, and retired in 1976 on attaining the age of 58 years.
thereafter he moved the central administrative tribu nal claiming that since he entered government service on permanent basis before 31.3.1938, he was entitled to contin ue in service till the age of 60 years, as per fundamental rule 56(c)(i).
dismissing the application, the central administrative tribunal held that since the appellant was appointed on permanent basis to the post of copyist on 1.8.41, he did not come within the purview of fundamental right 56(c)(i).
aggrieved, the appellant has preferred this appeal.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: it is correct that from 1st of july, 1937 upto 1st of august, 1941 the appellant has been shown in the service book to be appointed in officiating capacity to various posts but the fact remains that his basic appointment as paid apprentice was permanent.
the finding of the tribunal that the appellant was made permanent for the first time as copyist on 1st august, 1941 cannot be accepted in the face of clear entries in the service book showing that he joined as paid apprentice on permanent basis on 1st of july, 1937.
joining as paid apprentice on permanent basis cannot be anything else but entering government service on permanent basis and since the entry was before 31st march, 1938, fundamental rule 56(c)(i) is attracted and the appellant is entitled to remain in government service fill the age of 60 years.
[412d f] 411 [ this court observed that since the appellant has already completed 60 years, he be paid two years emoluments with all consequential benefits including any enhancement in the fixation of pension and other post retirement benefits.] [413d]
