the appellant purchased the property in dispute from the respondent but soon thereafter there was an agreement for reconveyance of the property to the respondent within a period of two years for almost the same value for which it was 'sold.
the relevant clause of this agreement was as follows: " clause 3 the purchase shall be completed by the purchasers within two years, i.e., to say on or before the 10th day of february, 1943, time being the essence of the contract.
if the purchasers shall on or before the 10th day of february, 1943, pay to the vendor a sum of rs. 10,001 the vendor shall at the cost of the purchasers execute such conveyance as may be necessary for conveying and transferring its right, title and interest in the said property free from encumbrances, if any, created by it.
" before the expiry of the stipulated period the respondent entered into correspondence with the appellant asking for the completion of the agreed reconveyance and intimating that the purchase money was ready to be paid, but after some correspondence the appellant 's solicitors totally repudiated the agreement for reconveyance.
the respondent did not then tender the price agreed to be paid and filed a suit for specific performance which was dismissed by the trial court on the ground that the respondent had not paid the money.
the high court decreed the suit.
held, that as the appellant had totally repudiated the con tract for reconveyance and had failed to perform his part of the contract it was open to the respondent to sue for its enforcement and the high court was right in holding that the respondent was entitled to a decree for specific performance.
in a case of total repudiation of the agreement for sale it was useless to make a formal tender of the purchase money.
