there is no hard and fast rule for determining whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or sale outright with a condition for repurchase.
each case must be decided on its own facts.
the numerous decisions of the high courts on the point are of no help because two documents are seldom expressed in identical terms.
the intention of the parties is the determining factor but the intention must be gathered from the document itself which has to be construed to find out the legal effect of the words used by the parties.
if the words are express and clear, effect must 'be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or in.
tended is ruled out.
if however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended.
175 in view of the provisions of the amended section 58(c) of the transfer of property act, if the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents, then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not.
but the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and, cannot be a sale.
if the condition of repurchase is embodied in the document that effects or purports to affect the sale, then it is a matter for construction which was meant.
