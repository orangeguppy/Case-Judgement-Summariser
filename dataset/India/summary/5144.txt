following the same line, separate original assessments for the assessment years 1962 63 to 1965 66 were also made.
on appeal by the asses see, the appellate assistant commissioner cancelled the assessments for all the years.
the income tax appellate tribunal and the high court confirmed the order of the appellate assistant commissioner.
in the appeals by the revenue to this court, on the question whether the incomes arising from the reserve fund and the expenses account of the nizam 's family trust deed can be aggregated in a single assessment for each of the assessment years 1960 61 to 1965 66. ^ held: 1.
the high court was right that the settlor intended to create separate trusts in respect of the reserve fund and the family trust expenses account, and that the respective incomes arising from the corpus of those trusts cannot be aggregated in one single assessment but must be assessed separately.
[979a b] 2.
it is open to a settlor to constitute two or more distinct trusts by a single document.
[978c] in the instant case, there is no doubt that separate funds were created, even though the division of the original trust fund may have been notional.
the objects for which the trustees held the reserve fund and the family trust expenses account are clearly demarcated and there is no overlapping or duplication.
there is also no intermingling of the funds.
the transfer of a portion from one to the other cannot lead to a confusion in the separate identity of the two trusts.
[978b e] 3.
although the corpus of the trust fund vested in the same trustees, the trustees nonetheless held distinct and severable portions of the corpus of the trust fund under those separate trusts.
that this construction of the document accords with the intention of the settlor is borne out by the provisions of sub clause (4) of clause 3 of the trust deed, which specifically provides that on the death of the settlor the corpus of the trust fund was to be divided or to be created as notionally 975 divided into the 175 equal units mentioned therein for being allocated to the settlor 's relatives specified in the schedule.
