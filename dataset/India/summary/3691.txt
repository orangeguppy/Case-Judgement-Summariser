the appellants, upon conviction under the relevant sections of the indian penal code, explosive substances act and arms act, were sentenced to various terms of imprison ment.
the total sentence of imprisonment to be undergone for some of the appellants was two years while in the case of other appellants it was one year.
the high court dis missed the appeal in view of the appellants ' entitlement to set off the period of their pre trial detention against the entire sentence of imprisonment imposed upon them after observing that it was not necessary to go into the matter as it would be only of an academic interest.
accepting the appeal by special leave and remanding the cases to the high court for disposing of on merits, the court, held: (1 ) the high court was in error in so far as it declined to go into the validity of the conviction of the appellants.
[600 f] (2) the object of a challenge to conviction is to avoid certain consequences flowing from conviction and also to erase the stigma resulting from the conviction.
the fact that the convicted person has already undergone the sentence or is otherwise entitled to be set at liberty because of the length of the period during which he has been under deten tion during the course of investigation, enquiry and trial cannot prevent the accused from challenging his conviction in appeal.
