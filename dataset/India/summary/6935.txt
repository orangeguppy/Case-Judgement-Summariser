the appellant, on 12.11.1990, was found carrying two gold pellets with foreign markings each weighing ten tolas, without any valid permit.
the order of detention under s.3(1) of the conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act, 1974 was passed on 7.1.1991.
the detention order was served on him on 28.6.1991.
the writ petition challenging the detention order, inter alia, on the ground of undue and reasonable delay in its execution was dismissed by the high court.
the detenu filed the appeal by special leave against the high court 's order as also the writ petition under article 32 of the constitution before this court.
allowing the appeal and disposing of the writ petition, this court, held: 1.1 the order of detention cannot be sustained since the `live and proximate link ' between the ground of detention and the purpose of detention is snapped on account of the undue and unreasonable delay in securing the appellant/detenu and detaining him.
the order of detention is liable to be set aside on this ground alone.
[p. 1080a b] 1.2 though the two gold pellets (the contrabands) were seized from the appellant on 12.11.1990, the order of detention was passed on 7.1.1991, and the detention order was executed after a period of 5 months and 11 days.
{pp. 1078f; 1079g h; 1080a] 1076 2.1 no sufficient cause is shown for not taking any action under s.7 of the cofeposa act.
the explanation that though cofeposa section in the office of the collectorate of customs requested the state government on 19.4.1991 to initiate action under s.7(1) (b) of the act it was not done so because the seizing unit was asked to make one more attempt to trace out the appellant is not satisfactory and reasonable one.
[pp. 1078g h; 1079a b] 2.2 no serious and sincere effort was taken by the arresting officers: there was only exchange of correspondence between the department and the arresting officers.
it is incomprehensible as to why no effort was made to secure the appellant/detenu during the two days, namely, on 6th and 20th feb.91, when he appeared before the assistant collector of customs.
