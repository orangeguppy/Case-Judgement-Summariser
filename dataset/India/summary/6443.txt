the appellant joined service under the state government as a lecturer.
later he was deputed to the directorate of youth services as an assistant director and subsequently confirmed in the said post.
on 27th of march, 1978, he was temporarily promoted as deputy director for a period of six months, and an order was made on 20th december, 1978 ap pointing him on a regular basis with effect from 27th march, 1978.
respondent no. 1 was recruited directly as deputy director on 28.7.1978, joined service on 7.8.1978 and was confirmed on 7.8.1980.
a draft gradation list was published on 25th january, 1983 wherein the appellant was shown above respondent no. 1, and he represented against this placement by claiming sen iority over the appellant.
this was not accepted, and a final gradation list was published on 14th september, 1983 maintaining the position shown in the draft list.
respondent no. 1 filed a writ petition before the high court which was transferred to the state administrative tribunal.
the tribunal held that respondent no. 1 was senior to the appellant as the promotion of 27th march, 1978 in favour of the appellant was a temporarily measure and after the six months period expired, the appellant was really not continuing as deputy director, and that the order of 20th december, 1978 issued by the government could not, there fore, provide a regular retrospective promotion in view of the special rules obtaining in the state.
it therefore, directed the redrawing of the seniority list by showing the appellant below respondent no. 1.
aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the tribunal, the appellant as well as the state government filed appeals to this court.
696 dismissing the appeals, this court, held: 1.
the tribunal has found that under karnataka state civil services (regulation of promotion, pay & pen sion) rules 1973 no retrospective promotion is admissible unless the situation comes within the various clauses of rule 2, and that the instant case was not covered by rule 2 and, therefore, the order of 22nd december, 1978 giving a retrospective promotion from 27.3.1978 was not justified.
[698b c] 2.
attempt was made to place the appellant above re spondent no. 1 by making shifting orders between 27.3.78 and 22.12.1978.
the appellant was editor of youth karnataka even when he was confirmed as assistant director and the tribunal has recorded that he never worked as assistant director.
the conclusion reached by the tribunal cannot be said to be wrong.
its order, therefore, does not call for any interfer ence.
