section 162 of the code of criminal procedure only bare proof of statement made to an investigating officer during the course of investigation.
it does not say that every statement made during the period of investigation is barred from being proved in evidence.
for a statement to come within the purview of section 162, it must not merely be made during the period of investigation but also in the course of investigation.
the two things, "the period of investigation" and "course of investigation" are not synonymous.
section 162 is aimed at statements recorded by a police officer while investigating into an offence.
this is clear from the opening words section 162.
they speak only of statement made to a police officer during the course of investigation.
this implies that the statement sought to be excluded from evidence must be ascribable to the enquiry conducted by the investigating office and not one which is de hors the enquiry.
