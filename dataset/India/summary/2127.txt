the appellants were released on bail by the high court under section 426 cr.
p.c., pending disposal of their appeal in the high court.
on an application by the state that the appellants were misusing their liberty and committing acts of violence, the bail was cancelled by the high court in the exercise of its inherent powers under section 561 a, cr. p. code.
on the question whether the high court had such power, held: the inherent power of the high court under section 561 a, ct.
p.c., can be exercised either for giving effect to any order under the criminal procedure code or to prevent abuse of the process of a court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice; but such power cannot be invoked in respect of any matter covered by a specific provision or inconsistent with any specific provision of the criminal procedure code.
under sections 497 and 498, cr.
p.c., the legislature has made express provision for the cancellation of bail in certain cases, but there is no express provision when an appellant is released on bail under s, 426 cr.
the omission must be due to inadvertence and cannot be regarded as deliberate, otherwise the subsequent conduct of the appellant, however reprehensible it may be, will not justify the high court in canceling the order of bail.
since the allegations against the appellant prima facie indicate abuse of the process of the court, section 561 a is attracted to the case and the high court was entitled to cancel the bail.
