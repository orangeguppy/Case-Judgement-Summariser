interest in property, by the provisions of the act and if compensation for such abolition, extinguishment or modification has not been provided for in the act, he could apply to the collector for compensation.
the first respondent was enjoying as jiwarak (maintenance) three rights under a compromise decree namely: (i) the right to recover the assessment in respect of certain lands in a jagir; (ii) the right to own and possess gharkhed lands in the jagir free from payment of assessment; and (iii) the right to receive a cash allowance annually from the jagir, when the jagir was abolished by the act.
on the question whether the respondent was entitled to claim compensation in respect of items (ii) and (iii) under section 14(1) of the act, held: (i) the first respondent was entitled to enjoy and was enjoying the gharkhed lands without the liability to pay assessment, but after the act came into force.
he was to enjoy those very lands with the liability to pay assessment under section 4 of the act '.
therefore, his interest in the property was modified to his disadvantage and so, he was entitled to claim compensation.
[619 a c] (ii) the first respondent was entitled to get the cash allowance from the jagir, that is, it was a charge on the jagir.
since it was also an interest in property which was extinguished on the abolition of the jagir, the first respondent was entitled to claim compensation.
