parliament by amending section 34 of the indian income tax act, 1922, by passing the indian income tax (amendment) act (xxxiii of 1954) has now provided that oases of those very persons who originally fell within the ambit of section 5(1) of taxation on income (investigation commission) act, 1947 (xxx of 1947) and who, it 788 was alleged, formed a distinct class, can be dealt with under the amended section 34 and under the procedure provided in the indian income tax act.
both categories of persons, namely, those who came within the scope of section 5(1) as well as those who came within the ambit of section 34, now form one class.
held, that after the coming into force of the indian income tax (amendment) act, 1954 (xxxiii of 1954) which operates on the same field as section 5(1) of act xxx of 1947 the provisions of section 5(1) of taxation on income (investigation commission) act, 1947 (xxx of 1947), assuming they were based on a rational classification, have become void and unenforceable as being discriminatory in character.
article 14 of the constitution not only guarantees equal protection as regards substantive laws but procedural laws as well.
when an act is valid, in its entire by before the date of the constitution the part of the proceedings regulated by the special procedure and taken during the pre constitution period cannot be questioned however discriminatory it may have been but the discriminatory procedure after the coming into force of the constitution cannot be continued.
