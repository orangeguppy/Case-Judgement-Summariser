on june 11, 1965, the standing committee of the raichur municipal council resolved to levy octroi duty according to sch.
ii under section 94 of the mysore municipalities act, 1964.
it was recited in the resolution that the confirmation of the general body be obtained.
the general body unanimously approved the resolution of the standing committee.
on october 27, 1965 the notification under section 95 of the act inviting objections from the public was published; no objections were received.
on february 26, 1966 there was a special general body meeting and it was.
resolved to levy octroi with effect from april 1, 1966.
this resolution was however amended by modification of its second paragraph on march 25, 1966.
approval to this modification was obtained at first by circulation to the members on march 31, 1966 the minutes of the meeting dated february 26, 1966 and the adoption of the resolution modifying the second paragraph by circulation on march 25, 1966, were read, heard and confirmed unanimously.
as required by section 123 of the act the model bye laws framed by government were adopted but the table of rates in model bye law 16 relating to the levy of storage fee and charges on goods placed in the bonded warehouses was, left blank.
the rates were fixed by the council by its resolution of march 31, 1966.
on april 16, 1966 sanction of the government under section 96 of the act to the levy of octroi and the adoption of model by laws was given and on may 3, 1966, the notification under section 97 of the act imposing octroi duty under sch.
ii and adopting the bye laws was published.
the respondents who were dealers in cloth in raichur moved the high court of mysore under article 226 of the constitution.
the high court held that though octroi had been properly levied its collection wag unau thorised owing to defects in the bye laws adopted.
the municipality appealed.
the following questions fell for consideration: (i) whether the resolution levying the octroi and the subsequent modification of the said resolution were procedurally valid (ii) whether the fixation of rates for the purpose of model bye law 16 was validly made, the procedure in section 324(4) and (5) not having been followed , (iii) whether the bye laws were unenforceable for the reason that they did not fix the time for the purpose of bye laws 23, 27 and 28 and did not give a list of articles for the purpose of bye laws 33 to 36.
held:(i) the resolution of the standing committee selecting octroi tax for imposition expressly stated that confirmation of the general body would be obtained, and such confirmation was actually obtained.
it could not in the circumstances be contended that 88 there was no valid resolution by the municipal council under section 94 selecting octroi duty for imposition.
[92f h] the resolution modifying the original resolution dated february 26, 1966 was no doubt passed by circulation but later the said circulation was "read, heard and confirmed unanimously" by the general body.
under section 80(5) any irregularity not affecting the merit of the case can be cured and section 97(2) prohibits enquiry into the regularity of the procedure by which a tax has been imposed after a notice under section 97 (1) is published.
no material had been placed before the court to show that in making the modification section 57 had not been complied with.
[93a d] municipal, board, hapur vs raghuvendra kripal & ors., ; , relied on.
(ii)if bye laws in respect of the matters specified in cl.
(m) of section 324(1) are made and submitted for sanction or model bye laws framed by the government for those purposes are adopted, the requirements of section 123(1) will be satisfied, and if government sanctions the resolution of the municipal council imposing octroi duty under section 97(1) and the notice is duly published.
octroi duty may be collected by the municipal council.
defect in 'the bye laws will not affect the authority of the municipal council to collect the tax for the authority arises under section 94(3) from act and the rules.
[94c d] the municipal council by fixing a tariff for storage fee under bye law 16 modified the model bye laws, and since the modification was made without the procedure prescribed in section 324(4) and (5) the said bye law was invalid.
as a result the municipal council was not entitled to levy any charge for storage under bye law 16.
but the validity of other bye laws was not thereby affected.
[94h 95c] (iii)the time contemplated to be fixed for the purposes of byelaws 23(e), 27 and 28 need not be fixed in the bye laws.
if time is fixed by resolution of the municipal council after the bye laws are sanctioned, there would be no defect in the bye laws.
[95e f] bye laws 33 to 36 depend for their operation upon the list of articles being effectively incorporated in bye law 32.
failure to incorporate the list of articles would result in the municipal council i being unable to enforce compliance with the requirement of taking out a licence.
the rest of the by laws did not threby become ineffective.
