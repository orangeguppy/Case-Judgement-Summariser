the respondents purchased the demised premises by a registered sale deed dated 7th december, 1977 for rs.70,000.
the appellant was in actual possession of a part of the premises as a tenant of the vendors at the date of purchase.
after the purchase the respondents served the appellant with a notice dated 13th december, 1977 calling upon him to pay the rent due, and deliver vacant possession of the demised premises.
the appellant replied to the notice on 29th decem ber, 1977 alleging that the vendors had orally agreed on 14th october, 1977 to sell him the property for rs.70,000, and had received rs.5,000 as earnest money, and that he was under no obligation to pay the rent and vacate the premises, since he was ready and willing to purchase the property.
the respondents sent a reply denying the existence of any such oral agreement.
a suit for eviction, was thereafter filed by the re spondents claiming rent from december 1977 to may 1978 from the appellant, and since the same was not paid, the appel lant it was contended had rendered himself liable to evic tion on the ground of wilful default.
the courts below held that the appellant failed to pay the rent, and concluded that he was a wilful defaulter and passed a decree for ejectment against him.
in the appeal to this court, on the question: whether it can be said 116 that the tenant 's default to pay or tender rent from decem ber 1977 to may 1978 was not wilful to avail of the benefit of the proviso to clause (i) of the sub section (2) of section 10 of the andhra pradesh building (lease, rent and eviction) control act, 1960.
the court, allowing the appeal.
held: 1.
an act is said to be wilful if it is intention al, conscious and deliberate.
[119a] section sundaram pillai etc.
vs v.r. pattabiraman etc.
, [1985] 2 scr 643, refered to. 2.
in order to secure eviction for non payment of rent, it must be shown that the default was intentional deliber ate, calculated and conscious with full knowledge of its consequences.
[119g] 3.
in cases where the tenant has defaulted to pay or tender the rent, he is entitled to an opportunity to pay or tender the same if his default is not wilful.
the proviso to sub section (2) of section 10 is couched in negative form to reduce the rigour of the substantive provision in section 10(2) of the act.
[118h; 119a] 4.
the appellant tenant in the instant case, did not pay or tender the rent from december 1977 to may 1978, not because he had no desire to pay the rent to the respondents but because he bona fide believed that he was entitled to purchase the property under the oral agreement of october 14, 1977.
he had also paid rs.5,000 by way of earnest under the said oral agreement.
he, therefore, bona fide believed that he was entitled to purchase the property under the said oral agreement and since he had already paid rs.5,000 by way of earnest thereunder he genuinely believed he was under no obligation to pay the rent to the respondents.
[119e f] 5.
this is not a case of a tenant who has failed to pay the rent without any rhyme or reason.
he was not averse to paying the rent but he genuinely believed that he was under no obligation to do so as he had a prior right to purchase the property.
[119h; 120a] 6.
this is a case where the controller should have invoked the proviso to sub section (2) of section 10 of the act and called upon the appellant to pay the arrears from december 1977 to may 1978 within a certain time.
failure to do so has resulted in miscarriage of justice.
the 117 ejectment decree cannot therefore, be allowed to stand and is accordingly set aside.
the.matter will go back to the controller who will give the benefit of the aforesaid provi so to the appellant.
