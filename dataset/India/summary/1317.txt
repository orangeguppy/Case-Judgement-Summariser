the appellant filed in the civil court a suit for permanent injunction restraining the respondents from entering the lands in suit on the allegation that the lands belonged to him and were in his cultivatory possession for many years and that the respondents had no right or title to them and had never cultivated them.
the respondents contended that they were tenants of portions of the said lands and were in cultivating possession of the same as tenants.
the question which arose for decision was whether having regard to the provisions of section 7(1) of the orissa tenants protection act, 1948, the civil court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit which involved a dispute as to the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties.
held, that even on a liberal construction of section 7(1) of the act it cannot be held that disputes as regards the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant fall to be deter mined by the collector under that section.
disputes which are entrusted to the collector under section 7(1) are the simple disputes specified therein in the five categories and do not include a serious dispute as to the relationship between the parties as landlord and tenant.
in the present case the suit was therefore within the jurisdiction of the civil court.
