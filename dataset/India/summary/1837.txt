the predecessor of the appellant had filed a suit in the district judge 's court to set aside that scheme.

it was contended that although the scheme was valid as framed tinder the earlier act, it incumbent under section 103(d) of the act of 1951 that the validity of the all the provisions of the scheme must be tested in the light of its provisions.
held:section 103(d) of the madras hindu religious and charitable endowments act, 1951, properly construed, merely meant that earlier schemes framed under madras act it of 1927 would be operative as though they were framed under the act of 1951.
it was not intended by the section that those schemes must be examined and reframed in the light of the relevant provisions of the act.
section 62(3)(a) of the act which provided for the modification of such schemes made this amply clear.
unless the schemes could be modified under that section they must be deemed to have been validly made under the act of 1951 and enforced as such.
