the appellant challenged the election of the respondent on the ground that the respondent committed various corrupt practices including that of publication of false statements in relation to the personal character of the appellant.
the high court held the allegations not proved.
dismissing the appeal, held: the provisions contained in sub section
(4) of section 123 are traveled when "any false allegation of fact pierces the politician and touches the person of the candidate".
it is the personal character and conduct of the candidate which is to.
be protected from malicious or false attacks.
the words "personal character and conduct" are to be equated with mental or moral nature and the word "conduct" connotes a person 's actions and behavior.
the statement in question has to be first a false statement bearing on the personal character and conduct of the candidate.
and secondly, the statement complained of must be one which is reasonably calculated to.
prejudice the prospects of the election of the person.

m.c. anjaneya reddy, [1965] 1 s.c.r. 175, reference to.
the electorate at the time of the election has to be kept in the forefront in judging whether a publication can be said to offend the provisions relating to corrupt practices.
the court is to ascertain whether the statement is reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of the candidate 's election.
in reading the documents it would be unrealistic to ignore that when appeals are made by candidate there is an element of partisan feeling and there is extravagance of expression in attacking one another and it would be unreasonable to ignore the question as to what the effect of the pamphlet would be on the mind of the ordinary voter who reads the pamphlet.
