the income tax officer, while assessing the respondent to tax discovered an undisclosed bank account of the 'respondent for a large sum.
he did not accept the explanation of the respondent as to the source of the amount and held that it represented income from an undisclosed source.
thereafter he initiated penalty proceedings under section 28 and imposed a penalty which was confirmed by the appellate assistant commissioner.
in appeal, the tribunal held that penalty proceedings were of a criminal nature and that the burden lay on the department to show that the amount concealed was of a revenue nature and was assessable as income and that the onus was not discharged in the present case by merely showing that the assessee 's explanation was not accepted in the assessment proceedings.
the high court agreed with the tribunal.
in appeal to this court, held.
(1) penalty proceedings are included in the expression "assessment" and the true nature of a penalty is the imposition of an additional tax.
but, one of the principal objects of section 28 is to provide a deterrent against recurrence of default on the part of the assessee.
there fore, the section is a penal provision and the proceedings were of a penal nature.

(2)the gist of the offence under section 28(1)(c) is that the assessee has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of such income, and therefore, the department must establish that the receipt of the amount in dispute constitutes income of the assessee.
