arbitration under the arbitration clause in the contract.
the award was made and signed on april 26, 1950.
the arbitrator did not send any notice of the making and signing of the award but sent a copy of the signed award to the appellant.

on march 30, 1951, the appellant filed an application in the subordinate judge 's court for passing a decree in terms of the award.
on the question whether the application was out of time, because, under article 178 of the indian limitation act, 1908, the application had to be filed within 90 days of the date.
of service of the notice of the making of the award, held: under section 14(1) of the , when the arbitrators have given their award, they shall sign it and shall give notice in writing to the.
parties of the making and signing thereof and of the amount of fees and charges payable in respect of the arbirtation and the award.
the notice need not be in the form of a separate letter.
it is sufficient, if it is in writing and intimates clearly that the award has been made and signed.
the non mention of the amount of the fees and charges payable in respect of the arbitration and award will not affect the notice as it is not an essential part of it for the purpose of limitation.
in the present case, since the appellant had sufficient notice that the award had been made and signed when a copy of the award signed by the arbitrator was sent to the appellant, the application for passing a decree in terms of the award was out of time.
