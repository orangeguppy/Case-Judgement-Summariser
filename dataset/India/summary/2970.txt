the respondent bank is a co operative society governed by the punjab co operative societies act, 1961.
a dispute between the bank and the appellant, one of its members, was referred by the registrar of co operative societies, in exercise of the powers vested in him by section 55 of the act, to the deputy registrar, co operative societies for arbitration.
the appellant filed an appeal against the award before the central registrar of co operative societies.
the central registrar dismissed the appeal holding that he was not the appropriate appellate authority, under the act.
in appeal to this court the appellant con tended that it was registered in 1955 under the punjab co operative societies act 1955 and by virtue of the and section 5(a) of the multi unit co operative societies act, 1942, it had ceased to be governed by the provisions of the punjab co operative societies act, because, it had become a multi unit co operative society.
dismissing the appeal, held : there is nothing in the provisions of the multi unit cooperative societies act to indicate that a multi unit co operative society cannot be a member of a co operative society governed by the punjab act of 1961.
the multi unit co operative societies act is for the incorporation, regulation and winding up of co operative societies with objects not confined to one state and it has no impact on section 55 of the punjab co operative societies act, 1961, in as much as the appellant remains a member of the co operative society, namely, the respondent bank.
if the appellant continues to be a member then the terms of section 55 apply and a dispute can be referred to arbitration under that section.
an appeal against that award lies under section 68 of the punjab act of 1961 to the government if the decision or order was made by the registrar and to the registrar if the decision or order is made by any other person.
therefore the central registrar had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
