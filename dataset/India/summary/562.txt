the appellant was charged under section 120 b of the indian penal code and section 167(8i) of the sea customs act, i878, which were bailable offences, and was released on bail by the chief presidency magistrate under section 496 of the code of criminal procedure.
an application made subsequently by the complainant for cancellation of the bail was dismissed by the magistrate on the ground that under section 496 he had no jurisdiction to cancel the bail.
the complainant invoked the inherent power of the high court under section 561a of the code and the high court took the view that under that section it had inherent power to cancel the bail,and finding that on the material produced before the court it would not be safe to permit the appellant to be at large, it cancelled the bail.
on appeal to the supreme court: held, that though under section 496 of the code of criminal procedure a person accused of a bailable offence is entitled to be released on bail pending his trial, if his conduct subsequent to his release is found to be prejudicial to a fair trial, he forfeits his right to be released on bail and such forfeiture can be made effective by invoking the inherent power of the high court under section 561a of the code.
but the inherent power has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only where such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself.
