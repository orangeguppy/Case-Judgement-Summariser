it was contended that section 8(1) proviso, of jammu and kashmir preventive detention act, 2011, under which the grounds of detention were not supplied to him, was unconstitutional as being inconsistent with articles 21 and 22 of the constitution and thus void to the extent of that inconsistency in view of the provisions of article 13 of the constitution.
held (overruling the contention) that section 8 (1) proviso is not unconstitutional in view of the provisions of constitution (application to jammu and kashmir) order, 1954 which supersedes the constitution (jammu and kashmir) order, 1950, and of clause (c) which has been added to article 35 of the constitution.
the effect of the modification of article 35 by the addition of clause (c) thereto is that such of the provisions of the act as are inconsistent with part iii of the constitution shall be valid until the expiration of five years from the commencement of the order.
