the petitioners who have been convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 of the indian penal code and have been sentenced to life imprisonment, claim entitlement to the benefit of section 5 of the act.
dismissing the writ petitions, held: the punjab borstal act, 1926 does not have application to an offence punishable under section 302 of the indian penal code.
[143g] the offence of murder is punishable with death even though the punishment awarded is not death but imprisonment for life.
[144h] 'punishable ' in section 2(4) of the act carries a meaning 'liable to be punished '.
since the offence under section 302 is punishable with death, the provisions of the punjab borstal act would not cover an offence under section 302 of i.p.c. and the benefit would not, therefore, be available to an accused convicted for the offence under section 302 i.p.c.
