the imposition of "profession tax" by the respondent municipal council under the travancore district municipalities act (act xxiii of the malayalam year 1116) was challenged on the grounds, inter alia (1) that the requisite notification was not published by the municipal council but by its commissioner, (2) that the period of thirty days which was given for filing objections to the imposition was insufficient in law which required a period of " not less than a month ", and (3) that this was a mandatory provision under the proviso to section 78 of the act.
held, that under section 16 the commissioner being the executive authority of the municipal council was authorised to give effect to the resolutions of the council and to perform all its executive duties.
the words " not being less than one month " in the proviso to section 78 implied the necessity for one clear month 's notice excluding the first and last day of the month, but the use of the words " reasonable period " before the words " not being less than one month " showed that the time given must be reasonable.
in view of the facts of the case the period allowed must be regarded as reasonable and to have complied with the provision which is directory in its later part.
