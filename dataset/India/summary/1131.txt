the appellant who was a shareholder and a director of a private company owning a colliery, was prosecuted for an offence under section 74 of the act for contravention of regulations 107 and 127 of the coal mines regulations, 1957.

it was not disputed that when the regulations were framed, no mining board as required under section 12 of the act had been con stituted.

accordingly, section 76 did not contravene article 14 of the con stitution.
