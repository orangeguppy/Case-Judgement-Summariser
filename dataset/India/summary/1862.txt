before the annual general meeting they would bring back the money into the company 's accounts to satisfy the general body that they had paid off their debts, and afterwards would again withdraw large sums for their own purposes.
in 1933 the managing agents ' company went into liquidation and it large debt was due from them to the company.

the company thereupon appealed to the supreme court.
it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the employment of the managing agents was incidental to the carrying on of the appellant 's business, that,as the managing agents had the power to borrow funds for the company and invest the surplus in loans to themselves, the loss such investment was also incidental to the carrying on the appellant 's business, and therefore the said loss was deductible in arriving at the, trading profits of the company.
