in january, 1924, while the appellant and the first respondent were both at malacca, they entered into another agreement whereby the first respondent transferred his remaining 21/2 shares to the defendant on receipt of 18,000 dollars as consideration.
in september, 1927 the first respondent instituted a suit against the appellant in india for a declaration that he was entitled to all the original five shares and for accounts and consequential relief, as both his agreements with the appellant were vitiated by fraud and fraudulent concealment.
the trial court granted the declaration, but the high court, in appeal held that while the arrangement of july, 1915 was valid, that of january, 1924 was vitiated by fraud and that the appellant was therefore liable to account for 21/2 shares and dividends amounting to 35,535 dollars with interest.
the high court also rejected a contention raised by the appellant that the period of his absence from the country could not be taken into account for determining the period of limitation and that the suit was therefore barred by limitation.
