the appellant assailed the said orders under art.226, which was dismissed.
on appeal by special leave the appellant contended that the question whether an employee is a workman or not was a disputed question of fact and law and, therefore could only be decided by a labour court and on a reference only but not by the state government while exercising its powers u/s 12(5).
dismissing the appeal, the court ^ held: (1) the order of the government acting under section 10(1) read with section 12(5) of the industrial disputes act passed after subjective satisfaction is an administrative order and not a judicial or a quasi judicial one.
