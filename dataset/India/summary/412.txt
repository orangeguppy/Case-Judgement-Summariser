so far as knowledge is concerned the court must attribute to the intoxicated man the same knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned, the court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying due regard to the degree of intoxication.
if the man was beside his mind altogether for the time being, it would not be possible to fix him with the requisite intention.
but if he had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew what he was about the court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act or acts, that rule of law is well settled: 1.that insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged; 364 2.the evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent; 3.that evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

on the finding in the present case that although the accused was under the influence of drink, he was not so much under its influence that his mind was obscured to such an extent that there was incapacity in him to form the required intention the offence was not reduced from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the second part of section 304 of the indian penal code.
