a single judge of the high court following the decision of this court in dharmendra kumar vs usha kumari ; , held that it could not be said that the husband was taking advantage of his 'wrongs ', but however expressed the view that the decree for restitution of conjugal rights could not be passed with the consent of the parties, and therefore being a collusive one disentitled the husband to a decree for divorce, and referred the matter to the chief justice for constitution of a division bench for consideration of the question.
the division bench held following joginder singh vs smt.
pushpa, air 1969 punjab and haryana page 397 that a consent decree could not be termed to be a collusive, decree so as to disentitle the petitioner to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, and that in view of the language of section 23 if the court had tried to make conciliation between the parties and conciliation had been ordered, the husband was not disentitled to get a decree.

[314 d e] 305 2.
section 9 is only a codification of pre existing law.
rule 32 of order 21 of the code of civil procedure deals with decree for specific performance for restitution of conjugal rights or for an injunction.
[314 h] 3.
section 9 of the act is not violative of article 14 or article 21 of the constitution if the purpose of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights in the said act is understood in its proper perspective and if the method of execution in cases of disobedience is kept in view.
[315 g] t. sareetha vs venkata subbaiah, a.i.r. 1983 andhra pradesh page 356, over ruled.
harvinder kaur vs harmander singh choudhry, a.i.r. 1984 delhi, page 66, approved.
it is significant that unlike a decree of specific performance of contract; a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, where the disobedience to such a decree is willful i.e. is deliberate, might be enforced by attachment of property.
where the disobedience follows as a result of a willful conduct i.e. where conditions are there for a wife or a husband to obey the decree for restitution of conjugal rights but disobeys the same in spite of such conditions, then only the properties have to be attached, is provided for.
this is so to enable the court in appropriate cases when the court has decreed restitution for conjugal rights to offer inducement for the husband or wife to live together and to settle up the matter amicably.
it serves a social purpose, as an aid to the prevention of break up of marriage.[315 c f] 5.
