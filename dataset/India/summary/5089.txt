the respondent assessee firm was registered in 1945 under the indian income tax, 1922.
the registration was up to the assessment year 1961 62.
on 8th november, 1961, the last day of the previous year relevant to the assessment year 1962 63, there was a change in the constitution of the firm.
from november 9, 1961, a new instrument of partnership came into existence.
on september 29, 1962 the respondent assessee firm applied for registration in form 11a under the income tax act, 1961.
the income tax officer refused registration on the ground that the case fell under section 184(7) of the act.
the tribunal upheld the order of the income tax officer.
the high court in a reference made by the tribunal under section 256(1) of the act.
held that on the date of application, the constitution of the assessee firm had changed and that the application was for registration of the firm which was in existence throughout the length of the previous year in relation to the first assessment under the act of 1961 and that being so, in accordance with rule 22(4)(ii) of the income tax rules, the application filed in form 11 a was a good and valid application.
dismissing the appeal by the revenue, this court, ^ held: 1.
the high court was right in holding that the application filed in form 11 a was a good and valid application.
[313c d] 2.1 section 26a of the 1922 act dealt with the procedure in registration of the firm.
under the provision, application might be made to the income tax officer on behalf of any firm constituted under an instrument of partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners 309 for registration for the purpose of that act and of any enactment for the a time being in force either relating to income tax or super tax.
the application was required to be made by such person or persons and was required to contain such particulars and had to be in such form and was required to be verified in such manner as had been prescribed.
it was thereafter required to be dealt with by the income tax officer, in the manner prescribed.
[311g h; 312a b] the act of 1922 contained power for the central board to make rules under the said act.
rule 2(a)(i) of said rules required the filing of an application for registration within a period of six months of the constitution of the firm whichever was earlier or in any other case before the end of the previous year, as was required by clause (ii).
application for renewal of registration under rule 6 had to be filed before the 30th day of june of a particular assessment year.
[312b c] 2.2 there were two types of forms given in form i which was the form of application for registration of the firm under section 26a of 1922 act.
one was an application for registration simpliciter where there was no registration but when the firm as constituted on the date of the application was different from the one whose income was under assessment then in schedule (b) of the form particulars of the apportionment of income, profits or gains or loss of the business in the previous year, between the partners who were entitled to shares in such income, profits or gains or loss had to be given.
the form of the renewal application was appended to rule (6).
[312c e] 2.3 under the 1922 act both the forms were meant for the purpose of first registration of the firm and not renewal, but the form of renewal appended to rule 6 was different.
essentially, similar is the position under the 1961 act.
chapter xvi of the 1961 act deals with that position.
section 182 of the act deals with assessment of registered firms, and section 184 of the act deals with application for registration of firm.
sub section (4) of section 184 stipulates that the application should be made before the end of the previous year for the assessment in respect of which registration was sought.
the income tax officer had power to entertain application even after the end of the previous year.[312g h; 313a b] 2.4 the scheme for renewal under 1961 act was different from the one under the 1922 act in one significant aspect, while under 1922 act the application for registration meant application for registration 310 for every year and if granted it was valid for one asesessment year but under 1961 act once registration is granted, such registration ensures for every subsequent year, if certain requirements are fulfilled.
such requirements are provided in sub section (7) of section 184 of the act.
[313b c] 2.5 it is apparent from relevant provisions of the two acts that registration granted under 1922 act cannot have effect of continuing the registration for the assessment year 1962 63 where 1961 act would apply.
for that year an application for registration of the firm has to be made under section 184(1) of the 1961 act, and the fact of such registration noted under sub section (4) of section 185 of the act.
sub section (7) would not come into effect at that time.
it would come into effect for the subsequent assessment year 1963 64.
