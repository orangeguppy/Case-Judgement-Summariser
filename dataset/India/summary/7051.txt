they refused to execute the reconveyance deed.
the appellant in the court of subordinate judge filed two suits for specific performance of the agreements of re conveyance, delivery of possession and mesne profits one suit against the respondent no.1, his 889 mother and 'a ' and the other one against the respondent no.1, his mother and 'b '.

the suits were decreed ex parte.
as iv and `b ' did not rile any application for setting aside the ex parte decree, the decree passed against them became final.
respondent no.1 and his mother filed an application to set aside the ex parte decree and the court set aside the decree and allowed them to contest the suits.
the suits were decreed against the respondent no.1 and his mother against which they riled appeals in the high court.

the plaintiff aggrieved against the judgments of the high court preferred the present appeals by special leave before this court.
allowing the appeals, this court, held:1.01.
a combined reading of the documents exhibits a.3, a.4, a.10 and a.11, leaves no manner of doubt that 'a ' and 'b ' had made an agreement to sell the properties in favour of the plaintiff and had also given a right to make the payment of such amount to respondent no.1 and his father which they were entitled under the terms and conditions of exhibits a.3 and a.4, the agreements of resale made in favour of 'a ' and `b ' respectively.
the plaintiff had filed a suit for specific performance of the agreement for sale impleading 'b ' and respondent no.1 and his father as defendants in one case and 'a ' and respondent no.1 and his father in another case and had also deposited the amount of consideration in the court which clearly proved that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.
there was no ground or justification for the high court to dismiss the suits filed by the plaintiff.
[894 e g] 890 1.02.the high court was wrong, in taking the view that it was only iv and 'b ' who were entitled to get reconveyance from respondent no.1 and his father and the plaintiff was not entitled to enforce such right by a suit for specific performance against respondent no.1 and his father.
[894 h] 1.03.the high court further erred in holding that the restriction of the period during which the plaintiff could have got the sale deeds executed in his favour was two years while 'a ' and 'b ' under exhibits a.3 and a.4 could have exercised such rights within a period of three years and such difference in the period deprived the plaintiff of his right to enforce the agreement of specific performance.
[895 b] 1.04.the plaintiff was exercising the right of specific performance of agreement of sale within the stipulated period of two years and it is unable to accept the reasoning of the high court as to how the period of three years granted in favour of 'al and `b ' in any manner affected or took away the right of the plaintiff to bring a suit for specific performance.
[895 c] 1.05.under the terms and conditions laid down in exhibits a.3 and a.4 the right of repurchase was not given as personal to 'al and `b ' and they were entitled to assign such right and the plaintiff having got such right under exhibits a.10 and a.11 was entitled to enforce such contract by riling a suit for specific performance.
the plaintiff in the present case also falls within the meaning of representative in interest as contemplated under clause (b) of section 15 of the .
on such assignment, the plaintiff appellant acquired a valid title to claim specific performance.
