the agricultural income tax officer, after considering the matter, allowed such deductions as he thought proper.
the appellant commissioner, in exercise of his revisional powers under section 34, kerala agricultural income tax act, 1950, issued notice to the respondent (widow of the assessee) proposing to revise the assessment on the ground that the deductions allowed were excessive.

within the time limit prescribed therein.
allowing the appeal to this court, ^ held:(1) every case of under assessment is not a case of escaped assessment.

this is not a case where the officer omitted to assess any item of income disclosed in the assessee 's return as in the case relied on by the high court and as in kamal singh vs c.i.t.
therefore, it is not a case of reopening escaped assessment.
