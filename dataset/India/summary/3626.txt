the respondent filed this suit against the order of the registrar of public trust, amraoti, declaring the ganjanan maharaj sansthan of mangrul dastagir to be a public trust.
the additional district judge 's order dismissing the suit, was upheld in appeal by the single judge of the high court on account of the respondent 's failure to serve a notice under section 80 c.p.c.
allowing a letters patent appeal, a full bench of the high court held that section 80 c.p.c. was not applicable to suits filed under section 8 of the (m.p.) public trusts act, 1951.
allowing the appeal, the court held: section 8 of the act indicates that the suit contem plated there is against the public officer in his official capacity within the meaning of section 80 of the code of civil procedure.
the words "act purporting to be done in official capacity" apply to non feasance as well as to misfeasance.
no distinction can be made between acts done illegally and in bad faith and acts done bonafide in offi cia1 capacity.
