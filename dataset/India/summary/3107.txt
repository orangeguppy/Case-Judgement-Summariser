the, petitioner challenged the order of detention in this court.
dismissing the petition.
held : both the incidents referred to in the order affected public order and not merely law and order.
[550 e f] the question whether a man only committed a breach of law and order or has act ad in a manner likely to cause disturbance of the public order, is a question of degree and the extent of the reach of the act upon the society.
the test to be adopted in determining whether an act affects law and order or public order is : does it lead to disturbance of the current of life of the community so as to amount to a ,disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an individual leaving the tranquillity of the society undisturbed ? when two passengers are robbed at the point of knives while travelling in a third class compartment of a running train the act affects riot only the passengers who are deprived of their valuables but also the other passengers who are watching in fear as helpless spectators.
likewise, the attack against the police party on the platform of a railway station by exploding bombs is bound to create panic and confusion among the passengers at the railway station.
consequently, there is bound to be terror and panic amongst the travelling public.
therefore, the acts in question, in the very nature of things, would adversely affect the even tempo of life of the community and cause a general disturbance of public tranquillity.
