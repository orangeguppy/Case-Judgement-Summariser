in proceedings under sections 111 to 114 and 118 of the act the addl.
collector of customs imposed a penalty of ks.3 lacs on each of them.
they preferred appeals to the appellate tribunal under section 129a. in an application made under section 129e the tribunal reduced the amount of penalty to be deposited to rs. 1 lac for each of them.
the appellants sought further reduction.
their case was that they had not gone out of the country and had no assets in india.
their passports were impounded at the time of arrest.
their visas had lapsed and could not be renewed.
they had no money and that in a situation of this type the condition for deposit of penalty was bad as it whittled down the appellants ' right of appeal.
the tribunal after considering the relevant factors declined to reduce the penalty further and dismissed the appeal for non compliance with the provisions of section 129e. dismissing the appeals under section 130e(b) of the .
held: right to appeal is neither an absolute right nor an ingredient of natural justice the principles of which pg no 434 pg no 435 must be followed in all judicial and quasi judicial adjudications.

[440e, 439f, 437g, 440c] in the instant case, the order of the tribunal was passed honestly, bona fide and having regafd to the plea of `undue hardship ' as canvassed by the appellants.
all the relevant factors, namely, the probability of the prima facie case of the appellants and the conduct of the parties were taken into consideration.
the tribunal noted the several abortive and defective attempts made to get extension of time to deposit the security.
firstly, the prayer was to accept rs.35,000 and secondly to accept rs. 60,000 in two months .
