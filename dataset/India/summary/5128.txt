rule 2 in appendix iii of the telegraph engineering service (group 'b ') recruitment rules 1981 was interpreted by the appellant department as requiring the candidates to secure 50% minimum pass marks for the general candidates and 45% minimum pass marks for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes in 'each ' of the four subjects or items.
on a challenge made by the respondent to this interpretation by the department, the administrative tribunal took the view that the requirement as regards securing minimum pass marks in the examination by the candidates concerned is referable to 'aggregate ' and not to 'each ' of the four subjects or items of the examination.
allowing the appeal of the department, this court, ^ held: 1.
the 'rule ' does not employ the expression 'aggregate '.
injection of the word 'aggregate ' in the rule in the disguise of interpretation would be self defeating and lead to absurd results and accordingly would be contrary to well established canons of construction, not to speak of a common sense oriented approach.
[830e f] 2.
the interpretation propounded by the tribunal would result in havoc and have a catastrophic consequencs.
[830d] 3.
since the rule does not specify a different passing standard for 'each ' subject, the prescribed minimum passing standard must be the yardstick to apply to each of the subjects or items.
minimum must mean the minimum in 'each ', as much as, minimum in 'aggregate '.
