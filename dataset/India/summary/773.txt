the appellant was employed as an assistant store keeper in the central tractor organisation, delhi.
he took delivery of a consignment of iron and steel received by rail for the organisation and removed them from the railway siding.
the goods did not reach the organisation.
the appellant absented himself from duty on the following days and when he was called he gave a false explanation that he had not taken delivery of the goods.
the appellant 1 was tried for misappropriation of the goods, under section 5(1)(c) of the prevention of corruption act, 1947.
at the 453 trial, he took the defence that he had moved the goods to another siding but this was not accepted and the appellant was convicted.
the appellant contended that his conviction was bad as the prosecution had failed to prove that he converted the goods to his own use and did not apply them to the purpose for which he had received them.
held, that the appellant had been rightly convicted.
the offence of misappropriation was established when the prosecution proved that the servant received the goods, that he was under a duty to account to his master and that he had not done so.
if the failure to account was due to an accidental loss then the facts being within the servant 's knowledge, it was for him to explain the loss; it was not for the prosecution to eliminate all possible defences or circumstances which may exonerate him.
the giving of a false explanation was an element which the court could take into consideration in determining the guilty intention.
