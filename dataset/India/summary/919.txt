a hindu father, speculating in gold and silver, lost heavily and sought to recoup by borrowing on a mortgage.
the mort gagee obtained a decree and sought to execute it by sale of the mortgaged property.
the sons and the wife sued for a declaration that the decree was not binding since the debt though antecedent was immoral (avyavaharik).
the trial court found in their favour and on appeal the district judge affirmed its decision.
on second appeal the high court held that it was for the plaintiff s to prove not merely that the antecedent debt was immoral but also that the mortgagee had notice of the said character of the debt and since they had led no evidence to discharge that onus, they were not entitled to a decree.
the plaintiffs came up on appeal by special leave: held, that the high court took the correct view of the law and the appeal must fail.
any attempt to test the correctness of the principles laid down by the privy council in the case of suraj bunsi koer, which have held the field for more than three quarters of a century, purely in the light of ancient sanskrit texts would now not merely be hit by the principle of state decisis, which must inevitably come into operation, but would also be inexpedient and futile.
suraj bunsi koer vs sheo proshad singh, (1879)) l.r. 6 i.a. 88 and brij narain vs mangla prasad (1923) l.k.
51 i.a. 129, applied.
the principles laid down in those two cases make no distinc tion between an alienation made for the payment of the father 's antecedent debt and an alienation made in execution of a decree passed against him and in both cases the sons must prove not only the immoral character of the antecedent debt but also the knowledge of the alience.
case law considered.
