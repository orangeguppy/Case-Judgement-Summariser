the, services of the respondent as an assistant traffic superintendent on the north east frontier railway were terminated after one month 's notice under rule 148 of the indian railway establishment code with effect from december 2, 1957.
an appeal to the general manager was held not to be competent.
on being offered a lower post the respondent accepted it.
by letter dated december 31, 1959 he was informed that his representation to the railway board had been rejected.
on december 5, 1963 this court in moti ram deka 's case held that rules 148(3) and 149(3) of the indian railway establishment code were invalid being violative of article 311(2) of the constitution.
the respondent made a representation in 1964 to the general manager for reconsideration of his case in the light of the said judgment.
the representation was turned down on the ground that the railway board had decided to instate only those employees whose services had been terminated in terms of rules 148/149 within a period of six years prior to the date of the supreme court 's judgment.
the respondent filed a petition under article 226 of the constitution which was allowed by the high court.
the general manager appealed.
held: the fixing of a period of six years was on the face of it arbitrary and there was no valid or reasonable explanation as to why this limit was fixed by the railway authorities.
if the termination of service of an employee in terms of rule 148 was wholly illegal and void because of violation of article 311(2) of the constitution, his reinstatement should have followed as a matter of course.
the contention that the railway authorities would have found a lot of difficulty and inconvenience in reinstating employees without taking into consideration the period which had elapsed was devoid of merit and could not be accepted.
