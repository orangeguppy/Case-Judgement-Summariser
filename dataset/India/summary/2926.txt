the plaintiff became a co sharer with the defendant in the suit property in the year 1941 as a result of some conveyances by members of the defendants ' family.
the property was in the occupation of military authorities by requisition under the defence of india act, 1939, and the rules made thereunder, for four years from 1942 to 1946.
the defendants were in exclusive possession thereafter from 1946 to 1955 when the plaintiff filed a suit for partition and possession of his share.
on the question whether the suit was barred by limitation under article 144 of limitation act, 1908, on the plea that as the military authorities had taken possession of the property from the defendants and had restored the possession to them in 1946 the possession of the said authorities was really under or on behalf of the defendants without causing any break in the continuity of their possession, held : the possession of the government was neither by permission of the defendants nor in the character of an agent of the defendants.
the orders of requisition, relinquishment of possession and payment, of compensation under the defence of india act read with act and the rules how that the possession was taken by virtue of the powers under the act and the rules irrespective of any consideration as to the rights of the true owner or the occupier who could make a claim to compensation.
therefore, possession of government by requisition under rule 75 a can not enure for the benefit of the person who was in possession before, for the purpose of enabling such person to acquire a prescriptive title.
