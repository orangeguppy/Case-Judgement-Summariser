the industrial court, bombay, awarded bonus equal to 4 1/2 months ' wages to the operatives of the tata mills ltd. and directed that those operatives who were no longer in the service of the mills should be paid the bonus in one lump sum by a fixed date and in such cases claims in writing should be made to the manager of the mills.
the operatives who made a claim before the date fixed were duly paid but payment was refused to operatives who applied after that date.
the operatives who had been refused payment made applications to the authority under the payment of wages act.
the mills contended that the authority had no jurisdiction to entertain the application, but the contention was rejected.
the mills filed a writ petition before the bombay high court which was dismissed by a single judge and an appeal against that decision was also dismissed by a division bench: held, that the bonus awarded by the industrial court was not wages within the meaning of section 2(vi) of the payment of wages act and as such the authority had no jurisdiction to entertain the applications made to it under section i5 of the act.
though such bonus was remuneration it was not remuneration payable on the fulfilment of the terms of the contract of employment, express or implied, as required by section 2(vi).
