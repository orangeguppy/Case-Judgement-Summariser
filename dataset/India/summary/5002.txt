in a criminal case where first information report is lodged and the police submits a report after completion of investigation initiated on the basis of such fir that no offence appears to have been committed, on the question whether in cases of this kind, the first informant or any relative of the dec eased or any other aggrieved person is entitled to be heard at the time of consideration of the report by the magistrate and whether the magistrate is bound to issue notice to any such person, the court, ^ held: i .
when the report forwarded by the officer in charge of a police station to the magistrate under sub section (2) (i) of section 173 comes up for consideration by the magistrate, one of two different situations may arise.
the report may conclude that an offence appears to have been committed by a particular person or persons and in such a case, the magistrate may do one of three things: (1) he may accept the report and take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (2) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or (3) he may direct further investigation under sub section (3) of section 156 and require the police to make a further report.
the report may on the other hand state that, in the opinion of the police, no offence appears to have been committed and where such a report has been made, the magistrate again has an option to adopt one of three courses: (1) he may accept the report and drop the proceeding or (2) he may disagree with the report and taking the view that there is sufficient ground for proceeding further, take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (3) he may direct further investigation to be made by the police under sub section (3) of section 156.
where, in either of these two situations, the magistrate decides to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process, the 943 informant is not prejudicially affected nor is the injured or in case of death, any relative of the deceased aggrieved, because cognizance of the offence is taken by the magistrate and it is decided by the magistrate that the case shall proceed.
but if the magistrate decides that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding further and drops the proceedings or takes the view that though there is sufficient ground for proceeding against others mentioned in the first information report, the informant would certainly be prejudiced because the first information report lodged by him would have failed of its purpose; wholly or in part.
moreover, when the interest of the informant in prompt and effective action being taken on the first information report lodged by him is clearly recognised by the provisions contained in sub section (2) of section 154, subsection (2) of section 157 and sub section (2) (ii) of section 173, it must be presumed that the informant would equally be interested in seeing that the magistrate takes cognizance of the offence and issues process, because that would be culmination of the first information report lodged by him.
the court is accordingly of the view that in a case where the magistrate to whom a report is forwarded under sub section (2) (i) of section 173 decides not to take cognizance of the offence and to drop the proceedings or takes the view that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against some of the persons mentioned in the first information report, the magistrate must give notice to the informant and provide him an opportunity of being heard at the time of consideration of the report, and the difficulty of service of notice on the informant cannot possibly provide any justification for depriving the informant of the opportunity of being heard at the time when the report is considered by the magistrate.[947g h; 948, 949a c] 2.
this court cannot spell out either from the provisions of the code of criminal procedure, 1973 or from the principles of natural justice, any obligation on the magistrate to issue notice to the injured person or to a relative of the deceased for providing such person an opportunity to be heard at the time of consideration of the report, unless such person is the informant who has lodged the first information report.
but even if such person ii not entitled to notice from the magistrate, he can appear before the magistrate and make his submissions when the report is considered by the magistrate for the purpose of deciding what action he should take on the report.
the injured person or any relative of the deceased, though not entitled to notice from the magistrate, has locus to appear before the magistrate at the time of consideration of the report, if he otherwise comes to know that the report is going to be considered by the magistrate and if he wants to make his submissions in regard to the report, the magistrate is bound to hear him.
[949e g] observation: even though the magistrate is not bound to give notice of the hearing fixed for consideration of the report to the injured person or to any relative of the deceased, he may, in the exercise of his discretion, if he so thinks fit, give such notice to the injured person or to any particular relative or relatives of the deceased, but not giving of such notice will not have any invalidating effect on the order which may be made by the magistrate on a consideration of the report.[949h. 950a] 944
