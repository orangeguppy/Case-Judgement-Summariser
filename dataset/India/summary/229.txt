held, that article 465 a and note i thereto of the civil service regulations relating to the retiring pensions of officers was applicable to the appellant who was employed in 1923 as a member of the indian service of engineers because rule 4 of the new rules published by the government of india on 15th november, 1919, providing for compulsory retirement of any officer after the completion of 26 years ' service was validated and confirmed by section 96 b of the government of india act , 1919, which came into force on 23rd december, 1919, and the language of note 1 to article 466 a published in 1920 clearly indicates that the government 's right to compulsorily retire an officer was not derived from note 1 as note 1 assumed its existence aliunde and the government 's right was derived from new rule 4 published on 15th november, 1919.
held also, that a compulsory retirement under the civil services (classification, control and appeal) rules, does not amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of article 311 of the constitution and therefore does not fall within the provisions of the said article.
the word "removal" used synonymously with the term "dis missal" generally implies that the officer is regarded as in some manner blameworthy or deficient.
the action of removal is founded on some ground personal to the officer and there is a levelling of some imputation or charge against him.
but there is no such element of charge or imputation in the case of compulsory retirement.
in other words a compulsory retirement does not involve any stigma or implication of misbehaviour or incapacity.
dismissal or removal is a punishment and involves loss of benefit already earned.
the officer, dismissed or removed, does not got pension which he has earned.
on compulsory retirement the officer will be entitled to the pension that he has actually earned and there is no diminution of the accrued benefit.
