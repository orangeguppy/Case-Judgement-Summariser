the second respondent originally filed an application for certain reliefs against its employer (the appellant company).
the labour court dismissed the application as not having been prosecuted for the default of the appearance of the applicants.
the second respondent filed a second application claiming the same reliefs.
the management objected to the maintainability of the second application contending that if the workmen were aggrieved by the earlier order, the proper remedy that should have been adopted by them was by taking action under r. 16(2) of the uttar pradesh industrial disputes, rules, 1957.
the labour court rejected the objection, and the appellant challenged the decision in a writ petition to the high court.
the high court dismissed the writ petition.
held: an order dismissing a case for default or non prosecution, does not come under sub r.
(1) of r. 16 and to such an order sub r.
(2) has no application.
neither the act nor the rules empower a tribunal or labour court to dismiss an application for default of appearance of a party.
rule 16(1) is the only provision providing for what is to be done when a party is absent.
that provision, which clearly enjoins the labour court or tribunal in the circumstances mentioned therein "to proceed with the case in his absence", either on the date fixed or on any other date to which the hearing may be adjourned, coupled with the further direction "and pass such order as it may deem fit and proper", indicates that the tribunal or labour court should take up the case and decide it on merits and not dismiss it for default.
the necessity for filing an application for setting aside an order passed in the case in the absence off a party, as contemplated under sub r.
(2) of r. 16 will arise only when .an order on merits affecting the case has been passed in the absence of a party, under sub r.
( 1 ) of r. 16.
