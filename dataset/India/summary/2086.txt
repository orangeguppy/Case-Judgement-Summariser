the appellant and the respondent were the tenant and landlord respectively, of the non residential premises in dispute.
the respondent 's application under section 8(3)(a)(ii) of the mysore house rent and accommodation control act, 1951, for eviction of the appellant on the ground that the respondent required the premises for the purpose of shifting his business which he was carrying on in a rented building, was ordered, but the order was set aside by the appellate court.
the high court in revision set aside the appellate order and restored the order of eviction.
in appeal to this court, it was contended that : (i) since the respondent was, within the meaning of section 8(3)(a)(ii), "entitled to possession" of the building in his occupation he had no right to ask for the appellant 's eviction; and (ii) the high court should not have interfered in revision under section 17 of the act.
held (i) the high court was right in ordering the eviction of the appellant from the premises.
the respondent, who was in occupation of a building as a tenant, and over which he had no absolute right of possession but only a right to remainin possession till one of the conditions in section 8(2) is satisfied.
could notbe said to be "entitled to possession" of that building.
those words aremore akin to the right of possession which an owner has in respect ofa building owned and occupied by him.
[873 f g] (ii)in not following the decision of the high court in narayanappa vs narasimhiah, , the appellate court acted with material irregularity and so the high court could set aside the appellate order in revision.
