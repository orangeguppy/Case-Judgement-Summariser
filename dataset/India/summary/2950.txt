the respondents organised a money circulation scheme.
for alleged cheating and misrepresentation in connection therewith they were convicted by the sessions judge, bhopal under section 120b and section 420 indian penal code.
the high court however acquitted them.
the state of madhya pradesh by special leave appealed to this court.
in support of the appeal the following facts were stressed: (1) none of the 200 odd persons who purchased the policy issued under the scheme received rs. 2309.50, the assured amount in the policy.
(2) the large amounts of rs. 90,750 and rs. 5,52,587.95 were detained by the respondents and showed the extent of wrongful gain by them.
(3) the policy holders had no control over other policy holders which would assure continuance of the scheme.
(4) merely because some persons receive some amount it could not be inferred that the scheme was not fraudulent.
(5) the evidence showed that the names entered in columns 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the pamphlet, issued by the respondents were bogus and that 2696 money orders were sent back to the remitter, as the persons were not traceable because of wrong address on the form.
held: as held by the calcutta high court in radha ballav pal 's case and haridas barat 's case there was an element of speculation in money circulation schemes, but those who ran them could not be held guilty of cheating unless there was misrepresentation or dishonest concealment of facts.
it could not be said in the present case that the respondents had deceived the public and thereby induced it to contribute money to the scheme.
the appeal must accordingly fail.

it is for the legislature to intervene if it wants to protect people who participate in these schemes, knowing that sooner or later the schemes are bound to fail.
