the appellant state filed an appeal in the high court on march 29, 1963 against the order made by the trial court on november 10, 1962 acquitting the respondents.
according to the information contained in the copy of the order produced along with the memorandum of appeal, the appeal was filed within time.
it showed that the copy was applied for on november 15, 1962 and it was ready on january 3, 1963.
it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the appeal was out of time in view of the fact that the appellant had applied for and obtained two other copies of the order appealed from and if time was calculated on the basis of those copies the appeal was beyond time.
in addition to the copy referred to earlier, the appellant had applied for another copy of the order appealed from on december 3, 1962, and that copy was ready for delivery on december 20, 1962.
the appellant also applied for yet another copy of the same order on december 21, 1962 and that copy was made ready on the same day.
it was not disputed that if the, period of limitation was computed on the basis of the two later copies, the appeal was barred by limitation.
the high court accepted the respondent 's contention and dismissed the appeal.
on appeal to this court.
held : that the decision of the high court under appeal did not lay down the law correctly.
the expression 'time requisite ' in section 12(2) of the limitation act cannot be understood as the time absolutely necessary for obtaining the copy of the order.
what is deductible under section 12(2) is not the minimum time within which a copy of the order appealed against could have been obtained.
it must be remembered that section 12(2) enlarges the period of limitation prescribed under entry 157 of schedule 1.
that section permits the appellant to deduct from the time taken for filing the appeal, the time required for obtaining the copy of the order appealed from and not any lesser period which might have been occupied if the application for copy had been filed at some other date.
that section lays no obligation on the appellant to be prompt in his application for a copy of the order.
a plain reading of section 12(2) shows that in computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal, the day on which the judgment or order complained of was pronounced and the time taken by the court to make available the copy applied for.
have to be excluded.
there is no justification for restricting the scope of that provision.
