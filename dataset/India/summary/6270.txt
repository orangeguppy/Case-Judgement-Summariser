pursuant to a scheme enacted for the benefit of ex military officials the appellant state appointed the re spondent on 20.8.1979 as secretary zila sainik board on contract basis for a specified period which was further extended upto 30.8.1985.
on 29.3.1985 the services of the respondent were terminated.
the respondent filed a writ petition before the high court challenging the termination order.
by an order dated 24.3.1988 the high court set aside the termination order holding that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service i.e. upto 30.8.1985.
the respondent preferred a review petition before the high court contending that pursuant to the interim order dated 10.7.1986 passed by the high court he was entitled to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.
by an order dated 26.7.1988, the high court allowed the review petition directing the appellant state to reinstate the respondent in service.
hence this appeal by the state.
allowing the appeal and setting aside the order passed on review, this court, held: 1.
in the instant case, the appointment of the respondent was indisputably in the nature of contract and under tile order of appointment he was entitled to continue in office in the post in question till 30th of august, 1985 and not beyond that date unless there was a further exten sion.
since no order of extension had been sanctioned by 240 the governor beyond 30th august, 1985 the respondent was entitled to the salary and allowances due to him till 30th of august, 1985 if tile order of termination of service was found to be an invalid one.
[242b; 244c] 1.1 the high court was right in disposing of the writ petition on 24.3.1988 declaring that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service, i.e. 30th august, 1985.
but it was not right in making an order on review on 26.7.1988 relying upon the interim order dated 10.7.1986 which ' in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the high court to dispose of the writ petition on merits as it did on 24.3.1988.
[245a b] 2.
the interim order passed by the high court did not and could not amount to a direction that the respondent was entitled to be reinstated in service irrespective of the merits of the case and the extent of his right.
the order passed on review is wholly unsustainable.
