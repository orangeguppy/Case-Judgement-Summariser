another prosecution witness deposed that the former witness told him immediately after the incident that the appellants were responsible for the murder.

held, that it was not necessary under section 137 of the evidence act that the witness to be corroborated must also say in his testimony in court that he had made the former statement to the witness who was corroborating him.
what s.157 required was that the witness to be corroborated must give evidence in court of some fact and if that was done his testimony in court relating to that fact could be corroborated by any former statement made by him relating to the same fact.
