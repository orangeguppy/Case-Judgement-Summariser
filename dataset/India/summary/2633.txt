the appellant 's four children, the respondents in the appeal, two of whom were majors and two were minors, filed an application under section 488 of the criminal procedure code in september, 1963 for an order requiring the appellant to pay them maintenance.
the trial court allowed the application and fixed the monthly amounts to be paid as maintenance to each of the children.
the appellant 's revision application was dismissed but one filed by the respondents was allowed whereby the additional sessions judge submitted the case to the high court with recommendations to enhance the maintenance allowance.
the high court accepted, the reference and thereafter, on an application by the appellant granted a certificate under article 134(1)(c) for an appeal to this court.
it was contended on behalf of the appellant that (i) section 488 cr.
p.c. was impliedly repealed by section 4 of the hindu adoptions and maintenance act 78 1956 insofar as it applied to hindus; (ii) that the word "child" in section 488 means a minor; and (iii) that the maintenance fixed for two of the major children was based on wrong principles and was excessive inasmuch as expenses for education had been taken into consideration.
held : dismissing the appeal : (i)there was no inconsistency between act 78 of 1956 and section 488 cr.
p.c. both could stand together.
the act of 1956 is an act to amend and codify the law relating to adoptions and maintenance among hindus.
the law was substantially similar before when it was never suggested that there was any inconsistency with section 488 cr.
the scope of the two laws is different.
section 488 provides a summary remedy and is applicable to all persons belonging to all religions and has no relationship with the personal law of the parties.

(ii)the word "child" in section 488 does not mean a minor son or daughter and the deal limitation is contained in the expression "unable to maintain itself".
if the concept of majority is imported into the section, a major child who is an imbecile or otherwise handicapped will fall outside the purview of this section.
if this concept is not imported, no harm is done for the section itself provides a limitation by saying that the child must be unable to maintain itself.
the older a person becomes the more difficult it would, be to prove that he is unable to maintain himself.

(iii)while it was not necessary to decide whether expenses for education can be given under section 488, in the present case, the court below were right in taking into consideration the situation at the time of passing the order i.e. that the two major children were college students.
