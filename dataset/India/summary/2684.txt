the appellants, motor transport operators, challenged the increase in surcharge of the fares and freights imposed by the andhra pradesh motor vehicles (taxation of passengers and goods) amendment and validation act, 1961.
they urged: (i) the act was neither regulatory nor compensatory in nature and, it fell directly within the mischief of article 301 of the constitution; (ii) the imposts exceeded the limits of permissible reasonableness, were not in the public interest and, therefore, violated articles 304(b) and 19(1)(g); and (iii) the act violated article 14 (a) inasmuch as it had not been made applicable to the telegana area although it was applicable to the andhra area and (b) the vehicles on inter state routes on permits granted by other states had not been subjected to tax.
