the questions for determination in the appeal were whether the award in question was invalid, (1) by reason of the court failing to comply with the mandatory requirement of section 23(l) of the , that the time within which the award is to be made, must be specified in the order, and (2) whether the arbitrator was in error in allotting to the appellant less than half share in the properties.
held, that under section 23(l) of the , it is imperative that the time for making the award must be fixed; but that does not mean that where the court omits to specify the time in the order of reference and does so elsewhere in the proceedings, the reference is invalid.
consequently, in a case where the order sheet of the court read with the order of reference made it clear that the arbitrator was to file his award by the date to which the suit was adjourned, it could not be said that the section had not been complied with.

held, further, that the award could not be said to be bad on the face of it and "otherwise invalid" merely because the appellant had received less than his due share.
the court cannot interfere with the findings of an arbitrator based on the best of his judgment unless it is shown that he has acted dishonestly.
