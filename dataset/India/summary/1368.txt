the validity of a scheme of road transport service approved by the government of orissa under section 68d (2) of the 682 , was challenged by the petitioners on the grounds (1) that a proper notice was not given for the hearing of objections to the scheme, (2) that the minister for transport who approved of the scheme was biased, (3) that the final scheme did not mention the date on which it was to come into operation, and (4) that the transport controller who published the scheme had no authority to do so.
^ held, that; (1) r. 8 of the rules framed by the orissa state government under ch.
iva of the , applied only to the first date to be fixed for hearing, and that if for any reason the hearing was adjourned, it was not necessary to give a fresh notice under the rule for the adjourned date of hearing; (2) the statement made by the minister in answer to a question put in the legislative assembly that the government had decided to take over all the routes from april 1, 1961, eliminating all private operators, was merely an indication of the government 's policy and that the minister could not be said to be personally biased; (3) the approved scheme was not invalid for the reason that the actual date of operating the route was not mentioned in the final scheme, as required under r. 3 (vi) of the rules, inasmuch as the notification publishing the final scheme referred to the draft scheme which contained that date and said that the draft scheme was approved, and, consequently, the rule must be considered to have been substantially complied with; and (4) the transport controller, being the chief officer of the state transport undertaking, had the authority to publish the scheme under section 68c of the act since the section provided that the state transport undertaking "shall cause it to be published" which meant that some officer of the undertaking would have it published in the gazette.
