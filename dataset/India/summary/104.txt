the judgment debtor preferred an appeal and an application, for revision to the high court against this order.
the high court held that the appeal was not maintainable but set aside the order of the subordinate judge in the exercise of its revisional powers and remanded the case to the subordinate judge for fresh disposal after considering whether it would have been possible for the decree holder to take any further steps in connection with the execution application after the dismissal of the application for adjournment: held, (i) that the order of the subordinate judge dismissing the execution case without giving an opportunity to the decree holder 's pleader to state what he had to say the case itself was bad and was rightly set aside by the court its own initiative in exercise of its inherent powers.
(ii)the high court had no jurisdiction in the exercise of its appellate powers to reverse the order of restoration as that order by itself did not amount to a final determination of any question relating to execution, discharge or satisfaction of a decree within the meaning of section 47, criminal procedure code, and an order made under section 151, criminal procedure code, simpliciter is not an appealable order.
