the appellant was an officer of the old state of mysore.
a the states reorganisation act of 1956, he entered service of the new state of mysore constituted under that act.
the appellant was entitled to the benefits of the service rules which obtained before his transfer to the.
new state of mysore, the relevant rules being the mysore services regulations as they stood on 1 november, 1956.
according to the state of mysore the appellant was due to retire at the age of 55 years.
he claimed however in a writ petition before the high court that the age of superannuation under the rules was 60 years.
the high court rejected the petition.
in appeal before this court it was common ground between the parties that it was the eighth edition of the regulations published in 1953 that was applicable to the case.
held : article 294 of the eighth edition does not leave any room for doubt on the point at issue.
the discretion to retire an officer whether of the superior service or of the inferior service at 55 years all officers attaining that age 'may be required to retire. 'it is clear that the officers themselves have no option in the matter.
if government decides to retire them, they must go out.
at the same time, however, the government has been given the discretion toretain them in service if the government considers them to be fit and efficient.
there is nothing in the language of article 294 which makes it incumbent on government to give this extension after the age of 55 years.
[205bc] there was therefore no merit in the appeal which must accordingly be dismissed.
