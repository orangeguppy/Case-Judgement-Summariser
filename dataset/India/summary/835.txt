the industrial tribunal, in the process of ascertaining the available surplus, disallowed a claim of the appellant employer for interest on a certain sum of money standing in the depreciation fund and alleged to have been used as working capital.
if this claim was allowed and the amount claimed deducted as a prior charge, the employees would not be entitled to any bonus as there would be no surplus.
the industrial tribunal was of opinion that even if the depreciation reserve was utilised as working capital no return thereon was allowable in deciding what amount was to be deducted as prior charge.
on appeal the appellant contended, inter alia, that the balance sheet of the employer company placed before the industrial tribunal itself showed that.
,the entire sum of depreciation fund was used as working capital.
held, that any portion of the reserve fund actually utilised as working capital in the year under consideration should be treated as entitled to a reasonable rate of return and the amount thus ascertained deducted as a prior charge in ascertaining the available surplus.
the balance sheet did not by itself prove the fact of utilisation of any reserve as working capital and the law required that such an important fact as the utilisation of the reserve as working capital had to be proved by the employer by evidence on affidavit or otherwise after giving opportunity to the workmen to contest the correctness of such evidence by cross examination.
