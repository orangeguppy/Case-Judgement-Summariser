the government by an order dated march 9,1979 revised the fee scales of certain categories of staff artists in doordarshan with retrospective effect from january 1, 1973 on the analogy of the recommendations of the third pay commission made in respect of regular government servants but the categories of the petitioners were denied the benefit by giving them junior scales.
in these writ petitions they assailed the said order as discriminatory and violative of articles 14 and 16(1) of the constitution.
their case is that the nature of work performed by them is similar to that performed by their counterparts in the film division and the qualifications required for appointment to these categories of staff artists are also the same as required in the cases of their counterparts in the film division.
they, therefore, claimed that they should be declared government servants and given the same pay scales as given to their respective counterparts in the film division of the same .ministry of lnformation and broadcasting with effect from the respective dates of their appointments.
the petitioners ' claim was contested by the respondents by contending that the staff artists of doordarshan were not government servants but were engaged on contract basis, that they were not of the same class as the employees of the film division and that they were therefore not entitled to the same scales of pay.

2.1 the petitioners perform the same duties as those performed by their counterparts in the film division, under the same ministry of information and broadcasting.
when two posts under two different wings of the same ministry are not only identical, but also involve the performance of the same nature of duties, it would be unreasonable and unjust to discriminate between them in the matter of pay.
