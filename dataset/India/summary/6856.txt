the appellant, was a member of a joint family with her son.
she terminated the tenancy of the predecessor in title of the respondents, by a notice dated june 24, 1960, giving rise to litigation culminating in the appeal before this court by the appellant, on the question whether the tenant became deemed purchaser of the land in question, in terms of section 32 of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act, 1948, which had declared april 1, 1957 as the tillers ' day and that the tenants of the lands who fell within any of the categories described in sub section (1) were deemed to have purchased the land held by them as tenants from their land lords, free from all encumbrances subsisting thereon on that day.
it was contended that in view of the provisions of clause (a) of subsection (1) of section 32f of the act, the tillers ' day was postponed in respect of the land in ques tion as the appellant was a widow, and hence it must be declared that she had terminated the tenancy of the tenant before he became a deemed purchaser of the land.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held: 1.1.
the proviso to sub section (1) of section 32f of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act, 1948, provides inter alia that the tillers ' day would not get postponed where the widow land owner is a member of a joint family, one of the members whereof was outside the protected categories mentioned under clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 32f of the act.
[457 f] 1.2 in the instant case, admittedly, the son of the appellant who was joint with her did not fall within any of the categories referred to in clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 32f of the act.
hence the predecessor intitle of the respondents became the owner of the said land on the tillers ' day as a deemed purchaser and the appellant lost her rights in the said 457 land.
notice given thereafter is of no avail.
