the appellant who was a shopkeeper was convicted for the second time by the additional district magistrate for contravening the provisions of section 7(1) of the punjab trade employees act, 1940, under which he was required to keep his shop closed on the day which he had himself chosen as a " close day ".
he raised the plea that the act did not apply to his shop as he did not employ any stranger but that himself alone worked in it and that the application of section 7(1) to his shop would be violative of his fundamental rights under articles 14, 19(1)(f) and (g) of the constitution and also that the restriction imposed was not reasonable within article 19(6) as it was not in the interest of the general 344 public.
the high court dismissed his application for revision of the magistrate 's order.
on appeal on a certificate of the high court, held, that the main object of the act was the welfare of the employees and to protect their as well as the employers ' health by preventing them from over work.
such a restriction being in the interest of the general public was reasonable within the meaning of article 19(6) of the constitution.
the provisions of section 7(1) were constitutionally valid and were justified as for securing administrative convenience and avoiding evasion of those provisions designed for the protection of the workmen.
