sub section (1) of section 14 of the , provided: " any property possessed by a female hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of this act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner." a suit instituted by the nearest reversioner of k for a declaration that the adoption made by k 's widow was invalid, was dismissed and during the pendency of the appeal filed against the decree dismissing the suit, the , came into force.
at the hearing of the appeal the respondent raised the preliminary objection that even if the adoption were held to be invalid, the appellant 's suit must fail in view of the provisions of section 14 of the act under which k 's widow, who was a party to the suit and the appeal, would be entitled to a full ownership of her husband 's properties, while it was urged for the appellant that section 14 of the act did not apply to the facts of the case because the properties were not in, the possession of k 's widow, but were only with the adopted son at the time the act came into force.
held, that the word "possession" in section 14 of the , is used in the widest connotation and it may be either actual or constructive or in any form recognised by law.

557, approved.
in the present case, if the adoption was invalid k 's widow would be the full owner of k 's estate, and even if it be assumed that the adopted son was in actual possession of the estate, his possession was merely permissive and k 's widow must be regarded as being in constructive possession of it through him.
accordingly, section 14 was applicable and as k 's widow became a full owner of her husband 's estate, the appellant 's suit was not maintainable.
