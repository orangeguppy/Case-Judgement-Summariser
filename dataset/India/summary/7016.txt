the respondents approached the central administrative tribunal to determine their seniority in the cadre of executive engineers from the date of eligibility, ie.
1.1.1985 and not from 21.1.1986.
the tribunal allowed the applications of the respondents, against which the present appeals were riled by the administration.
allowing the appeals, this court, held:1.01.
the selection to the post of executive engineer was to be done by following the procedure laid down under rule 8 of the punjab service of engineers, class i (buildings and roads branch) rules 1960.
eligibility under rule 6(b) of the rules by itself does not give a right to a member of class 11 service to be promoted to the post of executive engineer in class i service.
the promotion has to be made in accordance with the procedure laid down under rule 8 of the rules.
no member of class 11 service can claim 122 promotion to the post of executive engineer on the ground of eligibility alone.
unless a class ii officer has been selected in accordance with rule 8 of the rules he cannot be promoted to the post of executive engineer.
[125c e] 1.02.
the question of assigning seniority in class i service only arises after a class 11 officer has been selected and appointed to the said service.
the seniority in class i is determined under rule 12 of the rules, keeping in view the date of appointment as a result of selection under rule 8 of the rules.
[125f] 1.03.
the respondents in these appeals were appointed to the post of executive engineer, as a result of selection held under rule 8 of the rules, with effect from january 21, 1986.
their seniority has to be determined in class i service keeping in view the date of their appointments as january 21, 1986.
[125f g] 1.04 the tribunal grossly erred in directing the chandigarh administration to give seniority to the respondents from the date of their eligibility.
the respondents can neither be given the date of appointment as january 1, 1985 nor their seniority fixed from that date.
the directions of the tribunal in this respect are patently violative of the rules.
