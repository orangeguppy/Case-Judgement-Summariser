the appellant who was detained by an order dated 16th may, 1980, made a representation dated 3rd june, 1980 from jail, which was received by the state government on 4th june, 1980.
comments were called for from the customs authorities on the 6th of june, 1980 and were received on 13th june, 1980.
on the 17th june, 1980, the state government referred the representation to its law department for opinion which was furnished on the 19th june, 1980.
the representation was rejected by an order dated 24th june, 1980, which was communicated to the jail authorities two days later.

allowing the appeal, ^ held: 1.
in matters of this kind where all the material necessary for the determination of a new point is available on the record, and having regard to the importance of the matter, this court can entertain the point even if it had not been raised before the high court.
[277 f g] 2.
the order of detention declared unconstitutional and appellant directed to be set at liberty.
[279 f] 3.
on numerous earlier occasions this court has made it clear that it does not look with equanimity upon delays in considering the representations of detenus.
where the liberty of a person is involved it is the duty of the state to determine his representations with the utmost expedition and deal with it continuously until a final decision is taken and communicated to the detenu.
[278 g h] in the instant case no explanation had been given by the government, as to why no action was taken on the representation of the detenu on 4th, 5th and 277 25th of june 1980 and what consideration was given from 13th june, 1980 to 16th june, 1980 and why the file had to travel from table to table before reaching the chief minister, who was the only authority to decide the representation.
