the appellants gave kanta blows resulting in a number of injuries to a person.
some of injuries were incised wounds, some contusions, and some abrasions.
all the incised4 injuries except one showed that the bones had been cut.
on the question whether the conviction of the appellants under section 326, i.p.c. for grievous hurt was justified or not; held: the conviction under section 326 was fully justified.
in order to.
justify conviction under section 326, the injuries must satisfy the requirements of cl. 7 dr cl. 8 of section 320 of the indian penal code, otherwise they will be treated as simple injuries.
clauses 7 'and 8 of section 320 i.p.c., provide that an injury could only be designated as grievous if it is (1) a fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth, or (2) any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.
fracture has not been defined in the penal code.
it is not necessary that a bone should be cut through and through or that the crack must extend from the outer to the inner surface or that there should be displacement of any fragment of the bone.
if there is a break by cutting or splintering of the bone or there is a rupture or fissure in it, would amount to a fracture within the.
meaning of cl. 7 of section 320.
what has to be seen is whether the cuts in the bones noticed in the injury report are only superficial or do they effect a break in them.
[242 h; 243 d f] in the present case, some of the incised injuries show that they were bone deep and were described as cutting the underlying bone, which would show that they were fractures.
apart from this the doctor said that the injuries were grievous.
these injuries were inflicted by kantas which are dangerous weapons.
