the petitioner along with others, committed various offences on three occasions.
on the first occasion he attacked the people of a locality with a knife and by hurling bottles at them.
on the other two occasions he attacked the people of another locality, by hurling bombs at them.
he was detained under section 3(2) of the , with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
in a petition under article 32 for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, held : the incidents were not interlinked and could not have prejudiced the maintenance of public order.
they were stray incidents spread over a period of one year and four months, directed against individuals, and did not disturb society to the extent of causing a general disturbance of public tranquillity; and hence,.
the petitioner was entitled to be released.
the power to detain is an exceptional power to be used in exceptional circumstances and cannot be used as a convenient substitute for the ordinary process of law.
the acts complained of against the petitioner can at best be considered as prejudicial to "law and order" and not "public order" as required by the law relating to preventive detention.
