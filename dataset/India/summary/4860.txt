charges 2 to 4 were framed under section 302 read with section 34 i.p.c. alleging that in furtherance of their common intention, accused 1 to 3 committed the murder of ashamati on or about 10th november, 1975, accused 1 to 4 committed the murder of parubai on or about 29th november, 1975 and accused 1, 6 and 7 committed the murder of malan on or about 1st january, 1976.

the state also preferred under section 378 cr.
p.c. criminal appeal no. 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2, 34, 5 and 7 of charge no. 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120b.
there 780 being no further appeal by the state against acquittal; the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge no. 1 and of accused 1 to 3 of charge no. 2 and of accused 1 to 4 of charge no. 3 became final.
the high court considered the evidence, in the case, and dismissed criminal appeals nos. 7 of 1977 and the connected criminal state appeal no. 38 of 1977 and thereby confirmed the conviction and the sentence awarded to accused nos. 1 and 6.
the high court, however accepted the state appeal no. 605 of 1978 in part and convicted accused 5 and sentenced him to imprisonment for life under section 302 i.p.c. read with section 120b.
hence the present appeals by accused 5 and 6 only, accused no. 1 not preferring an appeal.
allowing the appeal no. 288 of 1980 of accused no. 5 and dismissing appeal no. 287 of 1980, the court.
^ held: 1.
in view of the fact (a) that accused 1 and 6 had been acquitted by the trial court of charge no. 1, that is, criminal conspiracy under section 120b read with section 302 i.p.c. (b) that no state appeal against their acquittal had been preferred and (c) that accused 5 was not a party to charge no. 4 which was framed against accused nos.

the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the high court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120b i.p.c. and accused 5 was not a party for the offence of murder of malan for which only accused nos.
1, 6 and 7 were tried.

however, the conviction and sentence of imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 341 i.p.c awarded to accused 6 is in order as there is sufficient evidence against him proving his guilt in respect of charge no. 4 framed regarding the murder of malan beyond all reasonable doubt.
the evidence of the approver p.w. 1 and the retracted confession of accused 6 exh.
