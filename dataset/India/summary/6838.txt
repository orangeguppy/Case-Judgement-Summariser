the union of india, the appellant, approached the high court under article 226 of the constitution, challenging notices of demand issued by the municipal council, respond ent no.1, claiming tax to the tune of rs. 28,400 by way of 'service charges ' due for the period 1954 to 1960, under article 285 of the constitution read with section 135 of the indian railways act, 1890.
the high court dismissed the writ petition negativing the claim, against which, this appeal by special leave was filed.
allowing the appeal, this court, held 1.
section 135 of the indian railways act, 1890 gets saved under article 285(1) of the constitution itself.
the said article provides that property of the union shall, save in so far as parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by the state or by any authority within a state.
[185 a b] 2.
section 1315 of the railways act permits taxation of railways by the local authority in the manner given therein; the central government being the controlling and the regu lating authority permitting liability at a given point of time, its extent and manner.
the indian railways act being a central enactment has no role to play in sub article (2) of article 285, for that is a sphere in which the state legis lation operates.
[186 a b] 3.
the reasoning of the high court to oust the applica bility of section 135 of the indian railways act on the test of sub article (2) of article 285 was totally misplaced, as also in not venturing to create room for it in sub article (1) of article 285.
the interplay of the constitutional 184 and legal provisions being well cut and well defined re quired no marked elaboration to stress the point.
