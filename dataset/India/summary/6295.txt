the petitioner challenged the appointment of respondent no. 1 as deputy prime minister of india on the ground that the oath administered to him as such was not the oath in accordance with the prescription of the constitution.
the petition was contested by respondent no. 1 and the union of india.
it was contended for the latter that de scribing respondent no. 1 as deputy prime minister was descriptive and for all purposes he was a minister, that the form of oath prescribed in the third schedule pursuant to the requirement of article 75(4) of the constitution is only for a minister of the union, and that there was no separate form even for the prime minister.
it was further submitted that the prescribed oath is susceptible of division into two parts, descriptive and substantial, and as long as the substantial part is properly followed, as in the instant case, a mere mistake or error in the descriptive part would not vitiate the oath.
dismissing the writ petition, held: respondent no. 1 is just a minister like other members of the council of ministers though he has been described as deputy prime minister.
the description of him as deputy prime minister does not confer on him any power of prime minister.
it cannot, therefore, be said that the oath administered to him as deputy prime minister was not the oath in accordance with the prescription of the constitution.
