in a suit filed by the respondent, the munsif though holding that there was a general custom of pre emption in the locality and that the respondent had a right to pre empt, under that custom, dismissed the suit because the sale did not include a strip of land 3 feet 6 inches wide between the respondent 's house and the property sold.
the respondent 's appeal was allowed by the district judge.
the appellants appealed to the high court which was unsuccessful because of the answer of the division bench to which the question was referred.
the division bench held that the law relating to pre emption on the ground of vicinage was saved by article 19(5) and was not void under article 13 of the constitution.
the appellant relied on the decision of this court in bhau ram vs baijnath and claimed that pre emption on the ground of vicinage could not be claimed.
the respondents in reply contended (a) that bhau ram 's case was concerned with a legislative measure whereas the present case arose from custom and was thus distinguishable and (b) that article 13(1) dealt with "all laws in force" and custom was not included in the definition of the phrase "laws in force" in cl.
(3)(b) of article 13.
held: (i) in so far as statute law is concerned bhau ram 's case decides that a law of pre emption based on vicinage is void.
the reasons given by this court to hold statute law void apply equally to a custom.
bhau ram vs b. baijnath singh, [1962] supp. 3 s.c.r. 724, followed.
digambar singh vs ahmad said khan, l.r. 42 i.a. 10, referred to.
(ii) custom and usage having in the territory of india the force of law are included in the expression "all laws in force".
