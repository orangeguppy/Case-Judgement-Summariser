on the refusal of the appellant employer to fix the minimum wages and rates for contract work of the workmen respondents who alleged that they were paid below the level of bare subsistance wage, the dispute was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication.
the first tribunal could not fix any minimum basic wage and the award of the second tribunal which fixed a scale was set aside on the ground that the appointment of the tribunal was not published according to law.
the third tribunal ultimately fixed the basic minimum wage on the industry cum region basis after considering the rates prevalent in various parts of the country and a place nearest to the appellant company.
the minimum awarded by the tribunal was slightly increased by the labour appellate tribunal in accordance with a statutory notification issued under ,the (xi of 1948), which had come into force after two years of the award of the tribunal and by which a scale of minimum wage and dearness allowance was fixed.
on appeal by the appellant company by special leave.
held, that the labour appellate tribunal committed no error of law in awarding the same minimum basic wage which was statutorily fixed and which came into force only two years after the award of the tribunal.
in determining the minimum basic wage the fact that a large amount of dearness allowance was paid to the employees in other comparable occupations in the same region should not be ignored.
in order that the central government might itself become the appropriate government within the meaning of section 2(a)(i) of the industrial (development and regulation) act, 1951, (65 of i 95 1) it must specify in that behalf that the industry in question was a controlled industry.
if the services of one tribunal were not available to the appropriate government it was perfectly competent to that government to appoint another tribunal to take up the work of adjudication.
