in the election held on 19.5.1982 to the haryana legislative assembly from the jind constituency, the appellant was declared elected over his nearest rival respondent no. i with a margin of 146 votes.
respondent no. i challenged the appellant 's election inter alia, on the ground that the appellant and his father sita ram and two others ram kishan and amrit lal visited kandela village on or about 16.5.1982 and contacted dalip singh, sarpanch of the village and one dewan singh, secretary of the backward classes.
thereafter all of them went to the house of one dharam singh where backward class voters including dewan singh, hari ram, devi ram, fateh singh and mauji ram had assembled.
the voters told the appellant that they intended to cast their votes in favour of congress (i) candidate as they had always been in favour of the congress (i) party then the appellant had a talk with the sarpanch dalip singh and one dharam singh and subsequently stated, for inducing the voters to cast their vote in his favour, that he is prepared to give a donation of rs. 5100 as he had been told that they needed some money for their mandir.
accordingly he gave a sum of rs. 5100 to the sarpanch dalip singh who passed it on to dharam singh and dewan singh.
the voters thereafter assured the appellant that they would vote for him and ensure that every vote belonging to their class will go in his favour.
thus, the appellant was alleged to have committed the corrupt practice of bribery as defined in section 123(1) of the representation of people act, 1951.
the appellant had denied that he had gone to kandela village on 16.5.1982 either alone or in the company of sita ram and others.
he also denied that he had contacted the sarpanch dalip singh and others and gave rs. 5100 as alleged in the election petition and that the voters of kandela village held out any promise for casting their votes in his favour.
the high court held that the appellant had committed that corrupt practice of bribery and set aside the election as void.
313 allowing the appeal by the appellant, a ^ held: 1.
as regards the corrupt practice of bribery, there is evidence only of p.ws. 1, 16, 90, 91 and 92 which is wholly unreliable and does not prove the corrupt practice of which the appellant has been found guilty by the learned single judge.
[320b] 2(i) the first respondent p.w. 1 has stated in his cross examination that the bribe money was paid by the appellant on 15.5.1982.
it would appear from his evidence that he claims to have personal knowledge about the alleged visit of the appellant and others to kandela village on 16.5.1982 and about the alleged payment of rs. 5100 by the appellant for the construction of a temple for the backward class people of the village in order to induce the voters of those classes to cast their votes in his favour.
but in his affidavit verifying the election petition he has stated that the allegations made in para 9(d) of the election petition regarding this item of corrupt practice are based upon information received by him from dewan singh.
therefore the evidence of p.w. 1 is wholly unacceptable.
[317c d] 2(ii) the evidence of p.w. 16 that on 15.5.82 the appellant offered to give a sum of rs. 5100 in the house of dewan chand and that it was given by one madan lal to dharam chand is inconsistent with the allegation in the election petition that the appellant offered to give rs. 5100 on 16.5.1982 as donation and gave it himself to the sarpanch dalip singh and he passed it on to dharama singh.
therefore the evidence of p.w. 16 also cannot be accepted.
[317h; 318a] 2(iii) the evidence of p.w. 90 is that the people asked for money to vote in favour of the appellant and that thereupon he gave rs. 5100 to dharma lohar on 16.5.82 is contrary to the allegation in the election petition, there is thus a vital discrepancy between the pleading in the election petition and the evidence of p.w. 90.
moreover p.w. 90 has stated that he does not know whether any receipt was passed for the amount whereas p.w. 16 has stated in his evidence that madan lal gave rs. 5100 to the temple committee 's president dharam singh in his presence on 16.5.1982 and he made an entry for receipt of that amount in exhibit p.w. 16/2 in the cash book.
in these circumstances no reliance could be placed on the evidence of p.w. 90.
[319d; f g] 2(iv) the evidence of p.w, 91 is also not consistent with the allegation made in the election petition that the appellant gave a sum of rs. 5100 to the sarpanch dalip singh and that he passed in on to dharam singh and dewan singh.
therefore no reliance can be placed on his evidence also.
[319d] 2(v) the evidence of p.w. 92 that madan lal of kandela village gave rs. 5100 is inconsistent with the allegation made in the election petition that the appellant himself gave that amount.
his evidence that it was given to dalip singh though consistent with the allegation made in the election petition and the evidence of p.w, 91, is inconsistent with the evidence of p.w. 90 that it was given to dharma lohar.
