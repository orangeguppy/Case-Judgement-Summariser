under a deed of settlement dated august 18, 1937, the respondent 's father settled certain properties on the widow of his son with life interest and upon her death those properties were to revert to the settlor or his heirs.
after the widow 's death, the respondent claimed the properties under the aforesaid deed of settlement.
however, the appel lant, brother of the widow set up title thereto under a will executed by the widow on may 14, 1964.
the question that arose for consideration in the courts below was whether the life estate created in favour of the widow under the settlement deed had been transformed into full ownership under section 14(1) of the of 1956 and all the three courts held that the fife estate carved out under the 1937 settlement did not get transformed into title in favour of the widow and she did not acquire any alienable interest in the properties to bequeath in favour of her brother.
dismissing the appeal by the appellant, held: 1. subs.2 of section 14 of the is an exception to subs.
1 thereof and if the situation is covered by subs.
2, transformation provided for in subs.
1 would not take place.
[360f] the settlement deed in the instant case, is an instru ment contemplated under subs.2 and admittedly it created a restricted estate in favour of the widow.
therefore subs.
1 of section 14 would not be attracted.
