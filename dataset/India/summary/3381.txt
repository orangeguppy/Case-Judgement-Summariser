the resondent filed a suit against the union of india alleging that due to negligence of the railways a consignment of tobacco despatched by him to gaya was substituted in transit and that in its place inferior tobacco was delivered at gaya.

the trial court dismissed the respondent 's suit.
the high court allowed the suit for damages but refused refund of excise duty said to have been paid by the respondent.
dismissing the appeal to this court, ^ held: (1) the appellant had not been able to make out a case of fraud.
