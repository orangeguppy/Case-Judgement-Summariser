the income tax officer took into account the respond ent 's entire dividend income of the year ending december 30, 1957, while calculating the super tax payable by it for the assessment year 1958 59.
in appeal against the computation the respondent contended before the appellate assistant commissioner that the dividend income included profits earned during the previous years, and that rebate should be reduced only with reference to the proportionate part of the dividend declared during 1957 which had come out of the other income assessed to income tax.
and super tax in the assessment year 1957 58.
the respondent 's contention was accepted in principle.
the department 's appeal was dis missed by the appellate tribunal.
the matter was then referred to the high court under section 66(1) of the indian income tax act, 1922, and decided in favour of the assessee.
allowing the appeals the court, held: for computing the reduction in rebate under para graph d of part ii of the first schedule to the finance act, 1958, the position of profits and gains as it existed in the previous year should be taken into account and not in the years prior to that clause (iii) introduces a fiction with regard to the amount of dividends which shall be deemed to have been distributed.
the taxing authorities have to take into account the company 's total income and the profits and gains other than capital receipts reduced by certain allow ances only in the previous year, i.e., the year in which the dividend was distributed.
the fact that those profits and gains accrued in years prior to the previous year and in cluded ' portions which were exempt from tax under the provi sions of the income tax act would not be of much relevance.
