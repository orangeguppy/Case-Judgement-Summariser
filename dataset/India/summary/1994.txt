the appellant filed a suit against the respondents for the recovery of rs. 8216 due on a promissory note executed by respondent no. 1 for a sum of rs. 6000.
the plea taken in defence was that the suit was not.
maintainable because the registration of the appellant under section 5(4) and r. 5 of the orissa money lenders act 1939 had become void on account of the money lent being in excess of the maximum amount of rs. 2,000 which the appellant was authorised to invest in the business by his registration certificate.
the contention was not accepted by the trial court but the high court.
accepting it, dismissed the suit.
in appeal, before this court, by special leave, it was urged on behalf of the appellant that the main act did not provide for any restriction on the amount of capital that could be invested and that the rules went beyond the act in making such a provision.
held : in the absence of any specific provision in the act providing for the fixing of the maximum capital which a money lender can invest in money lending business, it was not open to the state government to frame a rule in that regard and the rules framed by it about mentioning, in the application, the maximum capital for which the registration certificate was wanted and the mention in the certificate of the amount of the maximum capital for which the certificate is granted, do not lead to the conclusion that the registration of the money lender will become void if be exceeds the limit of the maximum capital laid down in the registration certificate.
