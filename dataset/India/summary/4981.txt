the tax credit certificate (excise duty on excess clearance) scheme 1965 was framed by the central government under section 280zd of the income tax act 1961.
it was made applicable to the cement industry in 1985.
for the year 1965 66, the excise duty for cement levied under the central excise and salt act 1944 was rs. 23.60 per ton, but under section 80 of the finance act 1965 a special duty of excise equal to 25% of the total amount of excise chargeable under the excise act on various articles including cement was levied.
the appellant company on the excess clearance of cement made during the concerned year 1965 66 over and above the quantity cleared in the base year (financial year 1964 65) applied for the grant of tax credit certificate to the concerned authority.
the authority however, granted tho, tax credit certificate only in respect of the central excise duty levied under the excise act, taking the view that the appellant was not entitled to have any tax credit in respect of any other excise duty levied under a different enactment, namely, section 80 of the finance act.
576 the appellant company challenged in the high court.
.theafore said view, but it was rejected on the ground that tax credit would not be available to the appellant company in respect of the, special excise duty levied under s.80 of the linance act, 1965 having regard to the special meaning assigned to the expression 'duty of excise ' by clause (b) of sub section (6) of section 280zd dismissing the appeals and special leave petitions to this court.

sub clause (3) & (4) of section 80 of the finance act, 1965 refer to the procedural aspect such as the quantification and collection of duty.
