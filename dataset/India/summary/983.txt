the appellant executed a deed of trust settling some of his lands for the maintenance of certain temples and thakoorbaries.
he was to be the trustee of the institutions and was to get 15% of the net income of those lands as trustee 's remuneration.
before the income tax authorities the appellant claimed that as the income received from agricultural properties of the trust by him as trustee was agricultural income in his hands and was by virtue of section 4(3)(viii) of the indian income tax act, 1922, exempt from liability to pay tax, the remuneration which by the covenant contained in the deed of trust he received was also exempt under that section because, when he appropriated a fraction of the rent or revenue of agricultural lands towards his remuneration, the original character of the income was not altered.
held, that the source of the right in which a fraction of the net income of the trust was to be appropriated by the appellant as his remuneration was not in the right to receive rent or revenue of agricultural lands, but rested in the covenant in the deed to receive remuneration for management of the trust, and the character of the income appropriated as remuneration was not the same as the character in which it was received by the appellant as trustee.
consequently, the remuneration not being received as rent or revenue of agricultural lands under a title, legal or beneficial in the property from which the income was received, it was not agricultural income within the meaning of section 2(1) of the indian income tax act, 1922, and was not exempt from taxation under section 4(3)(viii) of the act.
