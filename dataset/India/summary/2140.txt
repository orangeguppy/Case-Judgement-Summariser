the respondent, a manufacturer of cotton textiles, purchased unginned cotton and paid purchase tax thereon.
the cotton was ginned and pressed by the respondent, the ginned cotton was used in the manufacture of cotton textile while the cotton seeds were sold by it.
the respondent claimed refund of purchase tax paid on the unginned cotton under the bombay sales tax (exemption, set off and composition) rules, 1954 which was disallowed by the sales tax authorities on the ground that r. 6(ii) was not applicable when subsidiary or incidental product alone was ,,old and the main product was used in the manufacture of the goods and looking at the working of the aforesaid rule, all the products of the unprocessed goods should be sold.
in reference, the high court allowed the refund of the purchase tax under r. 12(i).
held : the respondent was entitled to refund under r. 12(i).
what is necessary under rule 12(i) is that the goods should have been actually used for the purpose specified viz., the production of any of the goods aforementioned for sale.
these conditions have been satisfied in this case because unginned cotton was used for the purpose of producing one of the goods specified in column 2 for sale, namely, cotton seeds.
