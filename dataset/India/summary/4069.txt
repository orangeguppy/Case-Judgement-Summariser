dismissing the appeal by special leave, the court ^ held: 1.
having due regard to the age of the accused munni marandi and to the absence of any overt act, a sentence of two years r.i. would, in the circumstances of his case meet the ends of justice for the offence u/s 149 read with section 326 i.p.c. [587 g h] 2.
absence of legislation cannot be made up for by judicial legislation, babua marandi was aged 15 years at the time of the offence and there is no children act in bihar.
though the conviction or sentence cannot be interfered with, in the hapless circumstances of the case and in the helpless situation of legislative vacuum all that this court can do is to direct that babua marandi be placed either in an open prison or in a model prison or any other prison available in the state where young offenders are kept apart from the adult offenders.
the special directions for doing so is that adolescents should be separated from adults in prison campuses for obvious reasons.
