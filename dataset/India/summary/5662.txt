disposing of the petition, ^ held: this court records it serious concern and disapproval of the growing conduct of parties and public officers, in particular, of ignoring the directions of the court and the multiplying instances of confrontation.
[285f] the court, including the apex one is a part of the state and is a built in mechanism of the constitution to administer justice in accordance with law.
for discharging that duty, the court has got to adopt an attitude of critical assessment of situations connected with litigation brought before it for adjudication.
the manner of functioning of the court in accord with the rule of law has to be dispassionate, objective and analytical.
the judges who preside over these courts do not act with a sense of superiority; nor do they look down upon others in the community.
[285f g] in order that the system may efficiently work and the purpose for which the courts are established is duly served, it is necessary that everyone within the framework of the rule of law must accept the system, render due obedience to orders made and in the event of failure of compliance, the rod of justice must descend down to punish.
everyone within the system must realise this situation and should not unnecessarily get into a confrontation.
[285h; 286a b] in the instant case, there is some material which if probed into further, might have established that respondent no. 6 had notice of the order of this court before physical dispossession of the petitioner was effected.
there is allegation of adoption of an attitude of resentment by respondent no. 6 or for the matter of that the local officers, when the writ petition was filed in this court.
that backdrop could supply the motive for the delay in complying with the directions of this court.
it is, however, not considered expedient to probe further into the matter on account of the fact that there has been compliance and each of the respondents has tendered unqualified apology which is accepted and the contempt notice is discharged.
