the appellant was appointed as a clerk in the state bank of india on december 14, 1953.
he made an application under s.33(c)(2) of the before the labour court.
he prayed before the labour court that he was enti tled to rs. 146/ plus dearness allowance as the benefit to which he was entitled under the sastry award but which had not been paid.
the case of the appellant was that he was entitled under the sastry award to have his annual increment in december each year as he was appointed on december, 14, 1953.
the case of the bank was that on the basis of the sastry award the appellant was entitled to get his annual increment in each year on april 1.
the respondent raised a preliminary objection that the question in regard to the increment of the appellant could not be decided in an application under s.33(c) (2) 276 of the act.
the labour court rejected this preliminary objection but on merits accepted the case of the bank.
hence the appeal.
held that under s.37(c)(2) of the the labour court has got jurisdiction to decide on an exami nation of an award or settlement whether or not the workman is entitled to the benefits claimed by him.
the preliminary objection must therefore be held to have been rightly rejected by the labour court.
(2) that para 292 of the sastry award dealt with the question of fitting the existing staff into the revised scales of pay.
persons who joined the service of the bank after the date when the new scales came into force would not be governed by para 292 of the award for the simple reason that they were not "existing staff" of the bank.
such workmen would come straight into the revised scales of pay.
thus, the present appellant appointed on december 14, 1953, would get the benefit of the new scales of pay from the very date of his appointment.
in consequence, he would get the increments under the new scale on december 14, each year.
