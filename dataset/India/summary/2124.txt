when item 40 of part 13 of the schedule to the constitution (scheduled castes) order, 1950, declared "sunris excluding sahas" as a schduled caste, it indicates that men of sunri caste but not those within that caste who formed the smaller caste group of sahas, are members of a scheduled caste.
it does not indicate that sahas are a caste distinct from the sunri caste, nor was it intended to exclude from sunris those members of that caste who bore the surname saha.
[391 a, d].
therefore, when the respondent challenged the election to the west bengal legislative assembly, of the appellant who described himself as a member of the sunri caste, on the ground that he was a member of the saha caste group but failed to prove the allegation, it must be held that the appellant was a sunri by caste and belonged to the scheduled caste specified in the item, even though he bore the surname saha.
[392 d].
