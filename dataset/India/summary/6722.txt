under rule 2 of the bihar public works department code, the governor of bihar took a decision on 7.4.1958 providing that 25% of the posts of assistant engineers in the bihar engineering service, class ii (the service) were to be filled by promotion, subject to availability of suitable hands, from overseers in the bihar subordinate engineering service (irrigation department) and 75% of the posts were to be filled by direct recruitment to the service.
respondents no. 1 to 5 in both these appeals were appointed as assistant engineers in the service on the recommendation of the bihar public service commission in the year 1961; and the appellants (in civil appeal no. 233 of 1978(respondents no. 6 to 23 in civil appeal no. 232 of 1978), who had been working as overseers in the bihar subordinate engineering service (irrigation department) were promoted to the posts of assistant engineers in the service in 1962 and thereafter.
however, by orders dated 12.7.1975, 20.1.1976 and 9.4.1977, the government changed the date of promotion of the appellants to the dates prior to the appointment of respondents no. 1 to 5 in the service, making the former senior to the letter.
respondents no. 1 to 5 filed writ petition before the high court challenging the seniority conferred on the appellants from the retrospective date and contended that the orders giving promotions to the appellants from a date earlier to date of their promotion in the service purported to affect prejudicially respondents no. 1 to 5 's right inasmuch as they were appointed to the service earlier to the promotion of the appellants; and that the seniority had to be reckoned amongst the officials working as assistant engineers in the service from the date of their appointment or promotion to the said service.
the appellants contended that they were entitled to be promoted retrospectively on the 411 basis of reservation of 25% of the cadre posts in the service till 1958.
the high court.
holding that the orders promoting the appellants with retrospective effect were bad, quashed the same and allowed the writ petition.
hence the present appeals.
on consideration of the legality and validity of the orders of the government giving promotions to the appellants from a date earlier to the date of their entry into the service as assistant engineers, and its effect on the inter se seniority amongst the appellants and respondents no. 1 to 5, who were directly appointed as assistant enginers in the service before the appellants entered in the said service.
dismissing the appeals, this court, held: 1.
the government orders dated 12.7.1975, 20.1.1976 and 9.4.1977 which purported to give promotion to the appellants retrospectively were arbitrary, illegal and inoperative inasmuch as these seriously affected rspondents no. 1 to 5.
the appellants were not borne in the cadre of assistant engineers even in officiating capacity at time when rspondents no. 1 to 5 were directly recruited to the post of assistant egineer.
as such, the promotee appellants could not be under any circumstance given seniority over the directly recruited respondents no. 1 to 5.
the judgment of the high court in quashing the impugned government orders was, therefore, unexceptionable.
[418f h; 420a] 2.1 no person can be promoted with retrospective effect from a date when he was not borne in the cadre so as to adversely affect others; and amongst members of the same grade, seniority is reckoned from the date of their initial entry into the service.
[419f] 2.2 seniority inter se amongst the assistant engineers in bihar engineering service, class ii would be considered from the date of the length of service rendered as assistant engineers.
therefore, the appellants could not be made senior to respondents no. 1 to 5 by the impugned government orders as they entered into the said service in 1962 and thereafter by promotion subsequent to respondent no. 1 to 5 who were directly recruited in the quota meant for them.
there was nothing to show that the appellants could be deemed to be recruited in 1958 quota and that these vacancies were carried forward.
