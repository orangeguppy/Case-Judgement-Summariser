on the completion of their 25 years of qualifying serv ice, the appellants were compulsorily retired in public interest, and were to receive 3 months salary in lieu of notice.
thereafter, the respondent government passed a general order forbidding re employment of compulsorily retired persons in semi government institutions.
the appellants filed, writ petitions under article 32 of the con stitution challenging the compulsory retirement orders as violative of article 16 and the ban on such re employment as a stigma under article 311.
dismissing the petitions, the court, held: (1) article 16 does not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for compulsory retirement.
the provi sion for compulsory retirement in public interest after the completion of a certain period of qualifying service or attainment of a certain age, applies to all government servants and as such it is not open to challenge either under article 14 or under article 16, and the individual applica tion of the order in a given case cannot offend article 16.
