the business of the assessee firm, carrying on land development business was sold as a going concern to a company promoted by the assessee s partners.
the purchase price included sums for the value of land, goodwill, etc.
the amount shown as the value of the goodwill v:as sought to be assessed to income tax on the grounds (i) that the assessee 's business was purely one of buying and selling land and (ii) the amount was profit attributable to the sale of land which was the stock in trade of the assessee.
in appeal to this court.
held: on the facts of this case it could not be said that the assessees were carrying on the business of purely buying and selling land.
they were engaged in buying land, developing it and then selling it.
the sale was the sale of the whole concern and no part of the slump price was attributable to the cost of the land.
if that was so, no part of it was taxable.
[617h 618a, e] commissioner of income tax, kerala vs west coast chemical and industries ltd. and doughty vs commissioner of taxes (1927) a.c. 327, applied.
in the case of a concern carrying on the business of buying land, developing it and the selling it is easy to distinguish a realisation sale from an ordinary sale, and it is very difficult to attribute part of the slump price to the cost of land sold in the realisation sale.
the mere fact that in the schedule the price of land was stated did not lead to the conclusion that part of the slump price was necessarily attributable to the land sold.
there was no evidence that any attempt was made to evaluate the land on the date of sale.
as the assessees were transferring the concern to a company.
constituted by the assessees themselves, no effort would ordinarily have been made to evaluate the land as on the date of sale.
