appellant 's daughter was married to respondent no. 2 on 15.12.1984.
she died on 13.8.1986.
the appellant filed a criminal comp .
laint against the respondents viz. daugh ter 's husband and his relatives for an offence under section 498 a, triable by a magistrate of first class, 'read with section 34 of the indian penal code, 1860 alleging that his daughter 's death was unnatural resulting from torture by her husband and his relatives.
by act no. 43 of 1986, the indian penal code was amended and section 304 b, offence of dowry death, was inserted in the code w.e.f.
19.11.1986.
since the newly inserted offence of dowry death was triable.
by a court of session, the appellant flied an application before the magistrate for committing the case to the caurt of session for trial of offence under section 304 b. 'the magistrate dismissed his application by holding that the amendment being prospective was inapplicable 'to the case because the death had occurred prior to the amendment.
thereafter the appellant filed an application in the high court for a direction to commit the case of dowry death to the court of session.
the high court also dismissed his application by holding that since the offence was committed prior to the date of insertion of section 813 304 b, the section was not applicable to the case.
in appeal to this court on the question whether section 304 b of the indian penal code was applicable to a case of dowry death where the death has occurred prior to the insertion of section 304 b, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that section 304 b of the indian penal code does not create a new offence and contains merely a rule of evidence.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
the offence of dowry death punishable under section 304 b of the indian penal code is a new offence inserted in the code with effect from .19.11.1986 when act no. 43 of 1986 came into force the said offence is punisha ble with a minimum sentence of seven years which may extend to life imprisonment and is triable by court of session.
the corresponding amendments made by act no. 43 of 1986 in the code of criminal procedure and the relate to the trial and proof of the offence.
section 498 a inserted in the indian penal code by the criminal law (second amendment) act, 1983 is an offence triable by a magistrate of the first class and is punishable with impris onment for a term which may extend to three years in addi tion to fine.
the offence of dowry death punishable under section 304 b provides for a more stringent offence than section 498 a. section 304 is a substantive provision creat ing a new offence and not merely a provision effecting a change in procedure for trial of a pre existing substanative offence.
the rule of evidence to prove the offence of dowry death is contained in section 113 b of the providing for presumption as to dowry death which was a simultaneous amendment made in the for proving 'the offence of dowery death.
the fact that the was so amended simul taneously with the insertion of section 304 b in the indian penal code by the same amendment act is another pointer in this direction.
there fore, it cannot be held that section 304 b. does not create a new offence and contains merely a rule of evidence.
[818d f, 819c d] 2.
the respondents are being tried in the court of magis trate of .the
first class for the offence punishable under section 498 a which was in the statute book on the date of death of appellant 's daughter their trial and punishment for the offence of dowry death provided in section 304 b of the indian penal code 'with the minimum sentence of seven years ' imprisonment for an act done by them prior to creation of the new offence of dowry death would clearly deny to them the protection afforded by clause (1) of article 20 of the constitution.
accord ingly, the view taken by the high court that the respondents cannot be 814 tried and punished for the offence provided in section 304 b of the indian penal code which is a new offence created subsequent to the commission of the offence attributed to the respondents does not suffer from any infirmity.
