responding to a notice under section 9 of the land acquisi tion act, 1894, the appellants flied a claim for rs.1500/ per acre at which rate the adjoining lands were sold.
the collector awarded compensation at the rate of rs.450/ per acre.
at the instance of the appellants under section 18 of the act, the matter was referred to the district judge who enhanced the compensation to rs.11,000/per acre.
an appeal by the collector was allowed by the high court on the ground that the district judge had acted contrary to the mandate contained in section 25(1) of the act, by awarding compensation in excess of the amount claimed.
the appellants contended that their land had building potentiality and its value was substantially more than rs.500/ per acre, which had been paid by them to the government as diversion charges for permission t.o use the adjoining land for building houses.
allowing the appeal by certificate, the court, held: the circumstance that the appellants had volun tarily paid rs.500/per acre as diversion charges, for laying out the adjoining land into plots as building sites, taken in conjunction with the other facts, namely, that the land in question is within the municipal limits and is located just on the edge of an inhabited locality of the town, having.
other buildings in the immediate vicinity, show that its potential value as building sites is much more than the rate of rs.450/ per acre, awarded by the collector and the high court.
