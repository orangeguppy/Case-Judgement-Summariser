section 4(2) of the provides that for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at the rate of 15 days ' wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned.
the employers sought to pay gratuity by dividing the workman 's monthly wages by 30 and computing the 15 days ' wages on that basis but the workman demanded that his monthly wages should be taken as what he got for 26 working days and not by taking half of his wages in a month of 30 days.
the controlling authority upheld the workman 's contention.
in dismissing the employer 's petition under article 227 of the constitution the high court observed that a worker received a full month 's wages not by remaining on duty for all the 30 days within a month but by remaining on work and doing duty for only 26 days and, therefore, gratuity payable to him should be calculated on this basis.
dismissing the employers ' appeals, ^ held: the view taken by the authorities, and upheld by the high court, is not in any way unreasonable.
although a month is understood to mean 30 days, the manner of calculating gratuity payable under the act to employees who worked for 26 days a month followed by the high court cannot be called perverse.
[67c] treating monthly wages as wages for 26 working days is not new or unknown.
the expression "average of the basic wage" occurring in an award has been interpreted by this court to mean the wage earned by a workman during a month divided by the number of days for which he has worked and multiplied by 26 in order to arrive at the monthly wage for the computation of gratuity payable to the workman.
