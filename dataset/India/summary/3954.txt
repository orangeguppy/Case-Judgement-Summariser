the apellant was apperhended at the bhuysawal railway station, and 17 containers with 17,000 white tablets were recovered from him.
the tablets were tested by the public analyst, and found to be not in accordance with the standard specified under section 18(a) of the drugs and cosmeties act.
the appelant was duly tried and convicted by the trial magistrate, under sections 27(a)(ii) and 28 of the act.
the appellant pleaded guilty, and in view of his young age, and that it was his first offence, the magistrate sentenced him only till the rising of the court.
but in revision, the high court enhanced the sentence to one year 's r.i.
it was contended that as there was no evidence to show that the tablets were "for sale", their possession simpliciter, of any quantity whatsoever, would not constitute an offence under section 27.
allowing the appeal as regards the conviction under section 27, the court, ^ held:1.
the absence of any cmma after the word "stocks" clearly indicates that the clause "stocks or exhibits for sale" is one indivisible whole and it contemplates not mere stocking the drugs, but stocking the drugs for the purpose of sale, and unless all the ingredients of this category are satisfied, section 27 of the act would not be satisfied.
[999 f g] 2.
there is no evidence to show that the appellant had either got these tablets for sale, or was selling them or had stocked them for sale.
before a person can be liable for prosecution or conviction under section 27(a)(i)(ii) read with section 18(c) of the act, it must be proved by the prosecution affirmatively that he was manufacturing the drugs for sale or was selling the same, or had stocked them or exhibited the articles for sale.
the possession simpliciter of the articles does not appear to be punishable under any of the provisions of the act.
