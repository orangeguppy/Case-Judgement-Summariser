on the question, whether limitation governs the suit for declaration by a dismissed employee, if the dismissal was illegal, void or inoperative being in contravention of the mandatory provisions of any rules or conditions of service, this court, allowing the appeals of the state the defendant, held: 1.
the court 's function on the presentation of plaint is simply to examine whether, on the assumed facts, the plaintiff is within time.
the court has to find out when the "right to sue" accrued to the plaintiff.
if a suit is not covered by any of the specific articles prescribing a period of limitation, it must fall within the residuary article.
[667h 668.
a suit for declaration that an order of dismissal or termination from service passed against the plaintiff is wrongful, illegal or ultra vires is governed by article 113 of the limitation act.
[6tog.h] 3.
the party aggrieved by the invalidity of the order has to approach the court for relief of declaration that the order against him is inoperative and not binding upon him.
he must approach the court within the prescribed.period of limitation.
if the statutory time limit expires the court cannot give the declaration sought for.
[669e f] 665 4.
if an act is void or ultra vires it is enough for the court to declare it so and it collapses automatically.
it need not be set aside.
the aggrieved party can simply seek a declaration that it is void and not binding upon him.
a declaration merely declares the existing state of affairs, and does not 'quash ' so as to produce a new state of af fairs.
[668f g] but none theless the impugned dismissal order has at least a de facto operation unless and until it is declared to be void or nullity by a competent body or court.

the words "right to sue" ordinarily mean the right to seek relief by means of legal proceedings.
generally, the right to sue accrues only when the cause of action arises, that is, the right to prosecute to obtain relief by legal means.
the suit must be instituted when the right asserted in the suit is infringed or when there is a clear and une quivocal threat to infringe that right by the defendant against whom the suit is instituted.
