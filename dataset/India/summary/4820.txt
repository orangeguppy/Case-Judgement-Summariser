an application for review against the order of dismissal of the special leave petition dated 9.12.83 was filled without disclosing any ground for review.
it was averred that the petition was being filed so as to be within the limitation prescribed under order xl of the supreme court rules and that further grounds would be filed if advised.
however, nothing was done though more than six months had elapsed by the date of hearing.
dismissing the petition, expressing its deep dissatisfaction and anguish with the indiscriminate manner in which petitions for special leave and petitions for review were being filed in the supreme court, [206a] ^ held: the application for review was nothing short of an abuse of the process of the court, a waste of the time of the court and was entirely frivolous.
