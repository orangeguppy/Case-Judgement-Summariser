the state of uttar pradesh issued two notifications in 1953, by one of which the uttar pradesh zamindari abolition and land reforms act, 1950, was extended to certain areas, in which, pargana agori which was owned by the respondent was situate, and by the other, it was directed that all " estates" in the area including the pargana should vest in the state.
the respondent challenged the notifications by a writ petition on the ground that the pargana was not an estate within section 3 (8) of the act.
while the matter was pending in the high court, the definition in section 3 (8) was amended by u.p. act 14 of 1958, and while appeals were pending in this court, by u.p. act 1 of 1964, by which, the pargana was deemed to be an "estate".
the amendments had retrospective effect from 1st july 1952.
the appellant state contended that act 1 of 1964 could not be impugned because, the pargana was an "estate ' either within article 3 1a(2) (a) or (iii).
held : the forest land or waste land in the pargana could not be deemed to be an estate within article 3 1a(2) (a) (iii) unless it was held or let for purposes ancillary to agriculture.
but the entire pargana is la grant in the nature of a jagir or inam, having been held by the respondent 's ancestor under sanads granting the land and the land revenue to him for services rendered to the british, and consequently, is an "estate, within article 31a(2) (a) (i) of the constitution.
[368 d, 370 g h; 371 f h] thakur amar singhji vs state of rajasthan [1955] 2 s.c.r. 303, followed.
the acquisition of the pargana was a necessary step in the implementation of agrarian reforms contemplated by article 31a.
therefore, u.p. act 1 of 1964 can claim the protection of article 31a, and the two notifications must be upheld.
