under the madhya pradesh motor vehicles (taxation of passengers) act, 1939, where returns have been accepted as correct nothing more need be done except to recover the tax due which has not been paid and no assessment order need be passed in view of the express language of section 7.
it is only when the returns have not been submitted or when returns submitted are found to be incorrect and incomplete that the tax officer has to make an enquiry and determine the sum payable by the operator by way of tax.
simmilarly if there has been escapement of tax, proceedings have to be taken under section 8 and an order has to be made after an enquiry.
the position would be the same if penalty is sought to be levied under section 9.
