the petitioner describing himself as an intending candidate for the presidential election filed a petition in the supreme court under article 71 (1) of the constitution of india impugning the election of the president, but it was returned by the registrar of the court on the ground that it was not in conformity with the provisions of the presidential and vice presidential elections act, 152, and the rules of the supreme court contained in or.
xxxvii a.
on appeal to the court it was contended for the appellant that (1) the petition was founded upon doubts as to the validity of the election and, in consequence, was not covered either by the act or the rules of the supreme court, (2) the act and the rules in question were void on the ground that they derogate from the jurisdiction conferred on the supreme court under article 71(1) and (3) in any case, the petitioner has a right as a citizen to approach this court for relief whenever an election has been held in breach of the constitutional provisions.
held that article 71(1) merely prescribes the forum in which doubts and disputes in connection with the election of the president and vice president would be enquired into, but the right to move the supreme court as well as the procedure therefor, are determined by the act of parliament as authorised by article 71 (3).
accordingly the act and the rules in question are valid, and the petitioner has no rights apart from those given by the statute to file an application for setting aside an election.
