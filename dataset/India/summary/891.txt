a hindu governed by the mitakshara school of hindu law died leaving three widows as his legal heirs.
the widows took the estate as joint tenants and did not exercise their right to separate possession and enjoyment.
the main income was from dividends and from immovable property.
the latter was held under section 9(3) of the income tax act not to be assessable as income 514 of an association of persons.
the question was whether the three widows could be assessed as an association of persons in respect of the rest of the income: held, that the three widows did not have the status of an association of persons within the meaning of section 3 of the income tax act.
an association of persons is one in which two or more persons join in a common purpose or common action and, for purposes of the income tax law, one of its objects must be to produce income, profits or gains.
it must be a combination of persons formed for the promotion of a joint enterprise for producing income.
in the present case except for receiving the dividends and interest jointly the widows had done no act which helped to produce the income.
