the assesses held the managing agency of a limited company in what was then called " british india and had also a pharma 728 ceutical business in the baroda state which was at the relevant time an indian state.
the business in british india showed profits assessable under the provisions of the business profits tax act, 1947, but the business carried on in baroda resulted in a loss, in the relevant chargeable accounting periods between 1946 and 1949.
before the income tax authorities the assessee claimed that the loss suffered by it in its business in baroda should be deducted in computing its business income liable to business profits tax, but this claim was rejected on the ground that though under section 5 of the act, if it stood by itself without any of the provisos, the act would be applicable to the baroda business, the third proviso had the effect of excluding that business from the purview of the act, except in so far as the income, profits or gains of the business were received or deemed to be received in or brought into british india: held, that the effect of the third proviso to section 5 of the business profits tax act 1947, was merely to exempt the income, profits and gains of the baroda business except when they were received or brought into british india, but the business itself was one to which the act was applicable under the substantive part of section 5.
consequently, the losses of the business could be set off against the profits of the business in british india.
the relevant provisions of the act are set out in the judg ment.
