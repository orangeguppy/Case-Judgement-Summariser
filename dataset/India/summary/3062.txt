in perspective publications (p) ltd. vs state of maharashtra, ; this court has laid down certain principles as to the law of contempt.
they are : (i) it will not be right to say that committals for contempt for scandalizing the court have become obsolete.
(ii)the summary jurisdiction by way of contempt should be exercised with great care and caution and only when its exercise is necessary for the proper administration of law and justice.
(iii)any one may express fair, reasonable and legitimate criticism of any act or conduct of a judge in his judicial capacity or make a proper or fair comment on any decision given by him.
(iv)a distinction must be made between a mere libel or defamation of a judge and what amounts to contempt of court.
the test in each 537 case would be whether the impugned publication is a mere defamatory attack on the judge or whether it is calculated to interfere with due course of justice or the proper administration of law by the court it is only in the latter case that it will be punishable as contempt.
[542 h] (v)alternatively, the test will be whether the wrong is done to the judge personally or it is done to the public.
the publication of a disparaging statement will be an injury to the public if it tends to create an apprehension in the minds of the people regarding the integrity, ability of fairness of the judges or to deter actual and prospective litigants from lacing complete reliance upon the courts administration of justice or if it is likely to cause embarrassment in the mind of the judge himself in the discharge of his judicial duties".

[544 b, 546 d] in the present case, the mere statement that a magistrate is friendly with a party who happens to be an advocate and enjoys his hospitality or has friendly relations with him will not constitute contempt unless there is an imputation of some improper motives as would amount to scandalizing the court itself and as would have a tendency to create distrust in the popular mind and impair the confidence of the people in the courts.
