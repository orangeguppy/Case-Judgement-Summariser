the respondents faced trial for the charge of theft.
after a general court martial, they were found guilty, convicted and sentenced.
all the three respondents were dismissed from service.
the respondents filed a writ petition in the high court challenging the decision of the court martial, and the order of the dismissal.
the high court set aside the order of conviction and punishment of imprisonment as also the order of dismissal from service by holding that the trial before the court martial general was in contravention of rule 22 of the army rules, 1954.
hence this appeal by the union of india.
allowing the appeal in part, this court.
held: 1.
it is a fact that the allegation at the stage of inquiry under rule 22 was described as prejudicial to good order and military discipline but the basic facts said to constitute that allegation were nothing else than removal of the foodstuff which constituted the charge of theft.
it is, therefore, clear that no prejudice has been caused to respondent 1 and the enquiry under rule 22 and the trial before general court martial were over the selfsame facts.
[21h; 22a] 2.
it is a fact that as against respondents 2 and 3 there was no inquiry under rule 22.
it is not disputed that the commanding officer of the unit had stated before the general court martial that he did not find any case against respondents 2 and 3.
the conclusion reached by the command ing officer was reasonable.
therefore there is no justifica tion to set aside the order of the high court so far as respondents 2 and 3 are concerned.
