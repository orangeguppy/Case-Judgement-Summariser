the appellant, a distiller of country liquor, carried on the business of selling liquor to licensed wholesalers.
due to shortage of bottles during the war a scheme was evolved, where under the distiller could charge a wholesaler a price for the bottles in which liquor was supplied at rates fixed by the government, which lie was bound to repay to the wholesaler on his returning the bottles.
in addition to this the appellant took a further sum from the wholesalers described as 'security deposit ' for the return of the bottles.
like the price of the bottles these moneys were also repaid as and when the bottles were returned with this difference that the entire sum was refunded only when go% of the bottles covered by it had been returned.
the appellant was assessed to income tax on the balance of the amounts of these additional sums left after the refunds made there out.
held, that the amounts paid to the appellant and described as 'security deposit ' were trading receipts and therefore income of the appellant assessable to tax.
these amounts were paid as an integral part of the commercial transaction of the sale of liquor in bottles and represented an extra price charged for the bottles.
they were not security deposits as there was nothing to secure, there being no right to the return of the bottles.
