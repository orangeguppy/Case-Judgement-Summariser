section 10(1)(b)(11) of the banking companies act, 1949 provided:" no banking company shall employ any person whose remuneration or part of whose remuneration takes the form . of a share in the profits of the company.
" the dispute between the appellant banks and their employees related, inter alia, to the question whether the provisions of the banking companies act, 1949, prohibit the grant of bonus to bank employees.
the labour appellate tribunal took the view that section 10 of the act did not stand in the way of granting bonus to bank employees, because bonus according to it was not a share in the profits of the company.
on appeal, it was contended for the appellant banks that bonus as awarded by the industrial courts is remuneration within the meaning of section 10 201 read with section 2 of the banking companies act, 1949, and that it was also a share in profits, and therefore, the express provisions of section 10 read with section 2 override the provisions of the , so far as banking companies are concerned, and prohibit the award of bonus to employees of banks.
held : (1) that the expression " shall employ any person in section 10 of the banking companies act, 1949, means and includes " shall have in employment any person " and that in this respect the amendment of 1956, merely makes clear what was already meant by the section ; (2) that the word " remuneration " in section 10 of the act has been used in the widest sense and includes bonus ; (3) that bonus in the industrial sense comes out of the available surplus of profits, and when paid, it fills the gap, wholly or in part, between the living wage and the actual wage.
it is labour 's share in the profits, and as it is a remuneration which takes the form of a share in profits, it comes within the mischief of section 10 of the act; (4) the , is not a declaratory act, and except in the small matter of the expression " shall continue to employ " in sub section
(1), it does not purport to explain any former law or declare what the law has always been.
consequently, though section 10 as amended by the act of i956 does not stand in the way of the grant of industrial bonus, for the period relating to the present appeals, the amended section had no retrospective effect.
accordingly, section 10 of the banking act, prior to the amend ment of 1956, prohibited the grant of industrial bonus to bank employees inasmuch as such bonus is remuneration which takes the form of a share in the profits of the banking company.
