after the poll the appellant was declared elected to the madras legislative assembly.
respondent no. 1 filed an election petition praying that it be declared that the election of the appellant was void.
in the petition it was alleged that two of the candidates at the election accepted money paid to them by the appellant and his election agent to induce them to abandon the contest and they actually abandoned the contest.
these two candidates were not made parties to the petition.
the appellant applied to the election tribunal to dismiss the petition under section 90(3) of the representation of the people act, 1951, for non compliance with the provisions of section 82 of the act on the ground that allegations of a corrupt practice were made against the two candidates and respondent no. 1 had failed to make them parties to the petition as required by section 82: held, that the acceptance of gratification is not a corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123(1) of the act and consequently it could not be said that allegations of corrupt practice had been made against the two candidates.
there was thus no non compliance with the provisions of section 82 and the election petition was not liable to be dismissed under section 90(3).
