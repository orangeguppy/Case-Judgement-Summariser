the appellant along with kanahiya lal, ram niwas and badri lal was charged under section 302 read with section 34 indian penal code and tried for the offence of murder of one gyanchand by the sessions judge, bhilwara, rajasthan.
the learned judge convicted and sentenced kanahiya lal alone to life imprisonment and acquitted the rest.
in appeal, the high court of rajasthan, while confirming the conviction of kanahiya lal as also the acquittal of two out of the three persons, convicted and sentenced the appellant also to life imprisonment.
hence the appeal under the supreme court enlargement of criminal appellate jurisdiction act, 1970.
dismissing the appeal, the court, ^ held: since the high court set aside an order of acquittal and sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment it is necessary for the supreme court to consider whether two views of the evidence are reasonably possible and whether, the high court was justified in setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial court in favour of the appellant.
approaching the case and assessing the evidence from that point of view, it is clear, that the conviction of the appellant in view of the evidence of bodu lal as corroborated by the discovery of the blood stained baniyan and knife is unassailable.
he is an independent and the most important witness in whose cycle rickshaw the appellant and the co accused kanhiya lal travelled from the hotel of shankar maharaj to the scene of offence.
bodu lal identified the appellant in the identification parade and his evidence as to the colour of baniyan worn by the appellant at the time of the incident tallied with that of the one stained with human blood and recovered from the accused.
a knife stained with human blood also recovered from his person confirmed his guilt.
