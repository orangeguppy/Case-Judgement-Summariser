the appellant brought a suit for possession of land against respondent birdhi lal, under ss. 180 and 183 of the rajasthan tenancy act, 1955.
the assistant collector, baran, dismissed the suit, but the revenue appellate authority allowed his appeal and held that birdhi lal was a trespasser.
a further appeal by birdhi lal was dismissed by the board of revenue, rajasthan.
thereafter, his application made under article 226 was allowed by the high court.
the high court held birdhi lal to be a tenant within the meaning of section 5(43), and not a trespasser as conceived by section 5(44).
on appeal by special leave, the appellants contended before this court that the high court was not justified in exercising appellate jurisdiction and interfering with the concurrent opinions of the revenue authorities.
it was further contended that even if birdhi lal was held to be a tenant.
he was liable to be ejected, as the original suit had been framed alternatively under section 180 of the act.
dismissing the appeal, the court ^ held: (1) the material on record does not establish that birdhi lal took or retained possession of the land without authority.
the essential conditions for holding birdhi lal to be a trespasser under section 5(44) were manifestly not satisfied.
the high court was right in rectifying the error of law apparent on the face of the record and quashing the judgments of the appellate revenue authority and the board of revenue.
[589f h & 590a] (2) the alternative case under section 180 required necessary averments and proof of facts which were absent in the case.
the plea therefore, cannot be entertained.
