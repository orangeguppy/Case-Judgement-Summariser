under an order passed by the appellant, a magistrate, one g was put in possession of some property on october 14, 1955.
in revision the order was set aside by the high court on august 27, 1957, and the opposite party s applied, on november.
20, 1957, to the appellant for redelivery of possession.
g applied to the high court for a review of its previous order and on november 25, 1957, the application was admitted and an interim stay was granted of the proceedings before the appellant.
on november 26, 1957, an application bearing an illegible signature and not supported by an affidavit was filed before the appellant indicating that the high court had stayed the proceedings.
a telegram addressed to a pleader, not the counsel for g, was filed along with the application.
the appellant refused to act on this application and telegram and on november 27, 1957, he passed an order allowing the application of s for restitution.
on november 28, 1957, a copy of the order of the high court was received and thereupon the writ for redelivery of possession was not issued.
the high court convicted the appellant for contempt of court for passing the order for restitution on november 27, when the high court had stayed the proceedings.
the appellant appealed to the supreme court and impleaded the chief justice and judges of the high court as respondents.
320 held, that the appellant was not guilty of cortempt of court.
before a subordinate court can be held to be guilt, of contempt of court it must be stablished that it had knowledge of the order of the high court and intentionally disobeyed it.
the knowledge must be obtained from a source which was either authorised or otherwise authentic.
in the present case the appellant was entitled to ignore the application as well as the telegram.
in a contempt matter the chief justice and judges of the high court should not be made parties and the title of such a proceeding should be "in re. . the alleged contemnor".
