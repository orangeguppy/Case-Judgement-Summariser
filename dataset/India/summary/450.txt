sub section (2) of section 30 of the ajmer merwara municipalities regulation, 925, as amended, provided that " every person who would be entitled under the representation of the people act, 1950 (xliii of 1950) to be registered in the electoral roll for a parliamentary constituency if that constituency had been co extensive with the municipality, and whose name is registered in the electoral roll for the parliamentary constituency comprising the municipality, shall be entitled to be enrolled as an elector of the municipality"; and section 43 enabled the chief commissioner to make rules consistent with the regulation for the preparation and revision of electoral rolls and the adjudication of claims to be enrolled and objections to enrolment.
in exercise of this power the appellant framed rules which, inter alia, provided that the electoral roll for the particular municipality shall be the same as the final printed roll for the parliamentary constituency representing the area covered by the municipality.
he notified an election programme and also authenticated and published an electoral roll on august 8, 1955.
the respondent whose father 's name was recited wrongly in the electoral roll applied for rectification of the mistake in the parlia mentary electoral roll, on august 10, 1955, but it was rejected on the ground that the roll of the municipal elections had been finally published on august 8, 1955, and therefore no correction could be made.
the respondent challenged the validity of the notification and the electoral roll.
held, that under section 30 (2) of the ajmer merwara municipalities regulation, 1925, the electoral roll for the parliamentary constituency was only treated as the basis for the electoral roll of the municipality and that the rules in so far as they made no provision for the revision of the electoral roll, for the adjudication of claims to be included therein or for entertaining objections to such inclusion, were defective and, therefore, the electoral roll of the ajmer municipality which was authenticated and published by the appellant on august 8, 1955, was not in conformity with the provisions of section 30 (2) and the relevant,provisions of the regulation 69 and could not form the basis of any valid elections to be held to the ajmer municipal committee.
