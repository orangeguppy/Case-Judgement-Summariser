by article 20(2) of the constitution "no person shall be prose cuted and punished for the same offence more than once.

the sessions judge on appeal upheld the conviction and sentence under section 409 of the indian penal code, but set aside the conviction and sentence under section 105 of the insurance act on the ground that no sanction under section 107 of the insurance act had been obtained.
sanction was thereafter obtained and a fresh complaint was filed against the respondents under section 105 of the insurance act.
the trial ended in an acquittal by the magistrate who held that article 20(2) of the constitution and also section 26 of the were a bar to conviction.
the state appealed to the high court against the 108 order of acquittal but the appeal was dismissed.
