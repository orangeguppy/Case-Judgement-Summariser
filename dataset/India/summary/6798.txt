the temporary junior professors and others applied for the posts.
the commission selected 25 candidates out of whom 21 were already working as temporary junior professors.

some of the junior professors were promoted on 10.9.1986 and appointed as professors.

high court contending that once the temporary services were regularised retrospectively with effect from the date of entry in the. service, the seniori ty should he reckoned by glvlng the benefit of regularised service notwithstanding the ranking in the approved list.
the high court allowing the writ petitions directed the govern 619 ment to make a proper order of promotion in the light of the views expressed in the judgment, against which appeals were made in this court.
allowing the appeals, this court, held: 1.
the order of regularisation of the services of the candidates expressly states that the inter se seniority of the candidates would be in accordance with the rankings in the approved list prepared by the public service commis sion and will not be affected in any way by the date of regularisation of services.
when the order of regularisation of temporary service itself denies such service for the purpose of determining seniority, the court cannot count that service for the purpose of seniority.
