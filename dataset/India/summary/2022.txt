in appeal to this court, held : on a proper construction of the central provinces and berar motor vehicles rules made by the state government in regard to the grant of permits and counter signatures of inter regional permits, the regional transport authority, raipur, was not competent to renew the counter signature on the permit for the inter regional route granted by the regional transport authority, bilaspur, and the permit was valid only so far as it related to the route within the limits of bilaspur region, (225 h] even though by section 63 of the , the power to counter sign the permit is entrusted to the regional transport authority of the region in which the remaining part of the route is situate, the effect of r. 63 is that the power to counter sign the permit is vested in the authority which grants the renewal of the permit.
in the context and the language of the rule the word "may" in the rule, though permissive in form, is obligatory.
if the regional transport authority, bilaspur, had power to renew the counter signature on the permit under the rule,, it must be held that the regional transport authority, raipur, had no such power under r. 62, because, the latter rule as expressly made subject to the provisions of r. 63, and the power granted to the regional transport authority under r. 62 is taken away by the provisions of r. 63.
