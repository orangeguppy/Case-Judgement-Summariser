the appellant was a partnership firm carrying on the business of manufacturing khandsari sugar in the district of muzaffarnagar, u.p.
under section 114 of the u.p. district boards act x of 1922 a district board had power to levy a tax on circumstances and property subject to certain conditions and restrictions.
the powers of district boards, under the aforesaid act were by virtue of the u.p. antarim zila parishad act, 1958 conferred on the parishads formed under the latter act.
the u.p. antarim zila parishad act 1958 expired on 31st december, 1959 but its life was extended to 31st december, 1960 by .amending
act no. 1 1960 which received the assent of the governor on january 5, 1960.
when the taxing officer of the antarim zila parishad muzaffarnagar subjected the appellant to circumstances and property tax for 1959 60 the appellant filed a writ petition in the high court contending inter alia that amending act no. 1 of 1960 could not continue the act of 1958 because the latter had already expired on 31st december, 1959 while the former received the consent of the governor on january 5, 1960.
the constitutionality of the taxing provisions was also challenged.
the writ petition was dismissed by the high court on the sole ground that the remedy by way of appeal under section 128 of the district boards act 1922, had not been exhausted.
the u.p. kshetra samitis and zila parishads adhiniyam of 1961 (u.p. act 32 of 1961) was passed in november, 1961.
acting under it the .taxing officer of the zila parishad subjected the appellant to circumstances and property tax for the year 1961 62 without giving any notice or inviting objections.
in respect of this assessment also the appellant filed a writ petition in the high court pleading denial of natural justice as well as challenging the constitutionality of the taxing provisions.
this petition was also dismissed on the same ground as the earlier one.
the appellant came to this court.
held: the rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies before a writ is granted is a rule of self imposed limitation, a rule of policy and discretion rather than a rule of law and the court may therefore in exceptional cases issue a writ such as a writ of certiorari notwithstanding the fact that the statutory remedies have not been exhausted.

there are at least two well recognised exceptions to the doctrine with regard to the exhaustion of statutory remedies.
in the first place it is well settled that where proceedings are taken before a tribunal under a provision of law, which is ultra vires, it is open to a party aggrieved thereby to move the high court under article 226 for issuing appropriate writs for quashing them on the ground that they are incompetent.
without his being obliged to wait until those proceedings run their full course.

state of bihar, a.i.r. 1961 s.c. 1615 and the bengal immunity co. ltd. vs state of bihar, , relied on.
in the second place the doctrine has no application in a case where the impugned order has been made in violation of the principle of natural justice.
[523 d] state of uttar pradesh vs mohammad nooh, [1958] s.c.r. 596, 605, referred to.
in the present case in view of the allegations of the appellant that the .taxing provisions were ultra vires and that there was a violation of the principles of natural justice the high court was in error in summarily dismissing the writ petition on the ground that the appellant had an alternative remedy of statutory appeal.
the high court was no doubt vested with a discretion but in the present case the discretion had not been exercised in accordance with law.
