the high court had clearly and indubitably jurisdiction to proceed with the trial against the respondent in respect of offences under sections 418 and 477a. on its plain language the inhibition in section 195(1)(c) applies only where a person is being tried for an offence under section 463 or punishable under sections 471, 475 or 476.
