' of the net annual profits subject to a minimum of rs. 50000 and an office allowance of rs. 1,000 per mensem.
the appellant claimed that the income derived from the managing agency was income from property held under trust to be applied wholly for charitable purposes, and was, in consequence, exempt from taxation under section 4(3)(i) of the indian income tax act, 1922.
it was contended on behalf of the income tax authorities (1) that the income in question was remuneration for services rendered and was not derived from any property, as a managing agency could not be considered to be property, and that, therefore, it did not fall within section 4(3)(i) of the act, (2) that on the terms of the deed of trust the managing agency could not be property held on trust, as no part of the sum of rs. 1 lac was utilised in the acquisition of the business so as to impress it with the character of accretion, and (3) that even if the managing agency business could be regarded as property within section 4(3)(i), it was governed by the special provision contained in section 4(3)(ia), and as the conditions laid down therein had not been satisfied, no exemption could be claimed.
held: (1) a managing agency is business which would be property within section 4(3)(i) of the act.
