on may 15, 1961 the state government passed orders (exhibit pi) that all panchayat officers functioning under the travancore cochin panchayats act, 1950 and panchayat execu tive officers functioning under the madras village pan chayats act, 1951 as on december 31, 1961 who continue to hold their appointments when the kerala panchayat act, 1960 came into force would be absorbed as panchayat executive officers under the new panchayats.
the order also provided that the staff of the malabar district board shall be ab sorbed as panchayat executive officers in suitable grades.
on the recommendation of the state public service com mission the state government appointed 17 panchayat officers in a higher grade by an order dated december 28, 1961 (exhibit p8) and the officer joined their posts between decem ber 30, 1961 and january 2, 1962.
to fill up the resulting vacancies 17 of this panchayat executive officers who were in grade ii (respondents 3 to 18) were appointed.
the appellants were appointed as executive officers on the grade i, as and from january 1, 1962.
the respondents ' representation to the government that they should be appointed with effect from december 28, 1961, that is, the date on which the public service commission communi cated their appointment was rejected by the state government (exhibit p10) on the ground that the vacancies arose only on the dates stated in that order commencing from december 30, 1961 and ending with january 2, 1962 and that the appointments can only be on the occurrence of the vacancies.
in a petition under article 226 of the constitution the high court directed that fresh lists be prepared.
allowing the appeal, held: the respondents are not entitled to the reliefs prayed for by them in the writ petitions.
[691 f] the appellants were promoted to a higher post before the respondents were integrated into the government service.on january 1, 1962.
throughout, the appellants have been treated as occupying a higher post and respondents much lower post.
though the promotion of the appellants was before january 1, 1962 and was confirmed by various orders of the government the respondents did not choose to chal lenge the orders till 1972.
[689 g] there is no ground for challenging exhibit p10 order.
it refers to the g.o. of february 13, 1962 by which 16 respond ents in the writ petition were promoted as executive offi cers grade i on the advice of the state public service commission.
their promotion having been ordered on february 13, 1962, without challenging that order a subsequent order which determined the date of their commencement of service cannot be challenged.
[689 e f] there is no merit in the respondents ' contention that if the vacancies in which the appellants and other panchayat executive officers were absorbed arose after january 1, 1962 the respondents would be entitled to be integrated along with the panchayat executive officers and since they were drawing the same pay they ought to have been given an equal ranking.
the appointments of the appellants and other panchayat executive officers were made before december 31, 1961 and as the integration was to take effect from january 1 688 1962 they cannot have any grievance.
further, the respond ents were not equated with the appellants and other pan chayat executive officers when they were integrated from the district board service.
