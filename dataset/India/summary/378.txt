a sentence of death passed on the appellant by the sessions judge of trichur (now situated in the united state of travancore cochin and previously in the former state of cochin) was confirmed by the high court.
mercy petitions presented to the raj pramukh of travancore cochin and to the president of india were rejected.
the question for determination was whether the appellant could rely on the pre existing power of the maharaja of cochin to exercise the power of pardon in respect of a sentence of death passed by the courts in his state, the prerogative right having been affirmed by article xxi of the covenant dated the 29th may 1949, entered into between the rulers of travancore and cochin.
held that the pre existing prerogative right of pardon vested in the maharaja of cochin must be taken to have been superseded and abrogated having regard to the events which culminated in the accession and integration of the state of travancore cochin with the dominion of india and thereafter its absorption into the union of india when the constitution of india came into force on the 26th january 1950, the continuance of such prerogative being inconsistent with articles 72, 161 and 238 of the constitution.
