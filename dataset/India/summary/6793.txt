mr. laxmidhar misra, in due course, submitted his report in two parts one dealing with the identification of the bonded labour and the second covering the inquiry into the implementation of the 21 directives.

mr. mahabir jain of the faculty of national labour institute was appointed to inquire into the measures and report on the degrees to which the 21 directives issued by the court had been implemented and to present to the court a clear picture of the issues involved for enabling it to make its own assessment and come to a conclusion as to whether the directions had been or were being implemented and also as to whether action for contempt was appropriate or in the matter of monitoring the social problem, some other course was necessary to he adopted, and in february, 1989, the report was submitted to the court.

for a loan taken at an exorbitant rate of interest the debtor virtually sells himself to the creditor and gets bonded usually for a period of life and renders service for the purpose of satisfying the debt.
the creditor anxious to exploit the situation ensures that the debt is never satisfied and often on the traditional basis of pious obligation the liability is inherited by the children of the original debtor.
the system thus provides a built in mecha nism for continuation of the under privileged section of the society by the privileged few living therein.
[537h 538b] 2.
the bonded labourers are paid nominal wages and often their family members are not permitted to take remunerative jobs elsewhere without permission of the master.

in the manner the employer has to make provi sion for water and medical care, it should also have the responsibility of providing schooling for the children of the workmen.

these are quarries located near about the industrial belt of haryana and not far away from delhi.
dust emanating from the, working area in haryana is bound to affect adversely ,the delhi atmosp 527 here.
if adequate importance is given to the angle of pollu tion the industry itself has to he regula`ed or may have to be stopped.

the state of haryana has not taken court 's interven tion in the proper spirit and has failed to exercise appro priate control though some eight years back this court had in clear terms laid down the guidelines and had called upon the public authority to take charge of the situation and provide adequate safeguards.

as a welfare state it is now the obligation of the state of haryana to cater to these requirements of the area.

in these circumstances the state of haryana was called upon to attend to the needs of the workmen in a well considered and systematic way.
since those workmen who will be working there have to be protected from the vagaries of employment and the anxiety of the employer to draw work without adequate payments, the authorities of the state of haryana must take care to protect the workmen from the hands of the: employer by ensuring compliance with the laws if there he any vacuum in the laws, the state of haryana should rise to play the role of a welfare state and.
