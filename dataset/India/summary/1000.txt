the appellant was a member of a joint hindu family which carried on the business of government stockists of grain under a contract with the government of bihar.
his nomination for election to the bihar legislative assembly was rejected on the ground that he was disqualified under section 7(d) of the representation of the people act, 195t, as he had an interest in a contract for the performance of services undertaken by the bihar government.
the appellant contended that the service undertaken by the government was the sale of foodgrains under the grain supply scheme and the contract was not for the sale of such foodgrains and did not attract the provisions of section 7(d).
held, that the contract was not one for the performance of any service undertaken by the government and the appellant was not disqualified under section 7(d).
a contract of bailment which imposed on the bailee the obligation to stock and store the foodgrains in his godowns was not a contract for the purpose of the service of sale of grain which the government had undertaken.
the government had undertaken the work of supplying grain but the contract was not one for the supply of grain.
