a hindu undivided family was assessed to tax under the indian income tax art 1918 in respect of its business, inter alia, in timber.
in 1934 there was dissolution of the family and five of its members entered into a partnership to carry on the business.
ibis firm was dissolved on march 31, 1939 and its accounts were settled on and up to that date.
the timber business of the dissolved firm was taken over by the assessee firm.
an instrument of partnerhip for the new firm was drawn up on june 29, 1939 in which the facts relating to the dissolution of the earlier firm were also recited.
the new firm the assessee was also dissolved in march 1943.
in assessment proceedings for 1943 44 the assessee claimed benefit under section 25(3) or in the alternative section 25(4) of the indian income tax act, 1922.
the claim was rejected by the assessing and appellate authorities but in reference, the high court allowed the claim under section 25(4).
the commissioner of income tax, with certificate, appealed to the supreme court.
the material question for determination was whether the assessee was carrying on business at the commencement of act 7 of 1939 so as to be entitled to the benefit under section 25(4).
held: the indian income tax (amendment) act 7 of 1939 was brought into force on april 1. 1939.
section 5(3) of the general clauses act (10 of 1897) provides that unless the contrary is expressed, a central act or regulation shall be construed as coming into being on the expiration of the day preceding its commencement.
act 7 of 1939 must therefore be deemed to have come into operation at a point of time immediately on the expiration of march 31, 1939.
[648 d e] whether the assessee was carrying on business at the point of time which act 7 of 1939 came into force had to be decided from the recitals in the partnership deed executed by the respondents on june 29, 1939.
the recitals in the instrument that the accounts were settled up to march 31, 1939 and that the erstwhile partners had become separate would imply that the firm formed in 1934 did not do business after march 31, 1939, the assessee was constituted to carry on the timber business allotted to it at the time of dissolution from april 1, 1939.
the timber business was an old and running business and an intention to maintain continuity of the business and its transactions may reasonably be attributed to the assessee.
it must therefore be held that the assessee commenced doing business immediately after the dissolution of the firm of 1934 become effective.
the business of that firm continued up to the midnight of march 31, 1939, and immediately thereafter the business of the assessee commenced.
[649 e h; 650 a] 646 the new partnership therefore came into being at the precise period of time at which act 7 of 1939 came into force and it could not be said that the assessee was not carrying on business at the commencement of the act.
the high court was therefore right in holding that the assessee was entitled on the dissolution of the firm in march 1943 to the benefit of section 25(4) of the indian income tax act, 1922.
