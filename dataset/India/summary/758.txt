this appeal by special leave was directed against the order of the high court asking the income tax appellate tribunal under section 66(4) of the income tax act to submit a supplementary ' statement of case on points, which were never raised by the parties nor decided by the income tax authorities or the tribunal.
the only question canvassed before them was whether certain cheques, which were received by the assessee at bhavnagar having been cashed in british india, the monies in respect of them could be said to have been received in british india.
the tribunal held that the monies related back to the receipt of the cleques and were as such received at bhavnagar.
the question was whether the receipt of the cheques at bhavnagar amounted to receipt of the sale proceeds at bhavnagar. ' the high court held that the mere receipt of the cheques by post at bhavnagar was not conclusive in absence of a further finding as to whether the cheques were sent by post without any request, express or implied, having been made by the assessee and observed as follows " but we cannot shut out the necessary inquiry which even from our own point of view is necessary to be made in order that we should satisfactorily answer the question raised in the reference.
it must not be forgotten that under sec.
66(4) of the income tax act we have a right independently of the conduct of the parties to direct the tribunal to state further facts so that we may properly exercise our advisory jurisdiction.
