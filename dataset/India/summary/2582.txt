the assessee company was carrying on the business of coal mining and of a dry ice factory, in addition to various other kinds of business.
it obtained a prospecting licence, and after prospecting for coal sold it within a short time of its acquisition and thereby earned profits in the accoun ting years 1948 49 and 1949 50.
it sold the ice factory in 1948.
though the purchaser took possession of the ice factory in 1948, the price was finally settled in december 1949.
by that sale the assessee company suffered a loss.
the assessee claimed (1) that the 'profits were gains of a capital nature and hence not liable to tax; and (2) that the loss was deductible from its income in the assessment year 1950 51.
(1) the department, tribunal and high court held that the profits from the sale of colliery were in the nature of revenue and were liable to tax under the income tax act, in the two corresponding assessment years, namely, 1949 50 and 1950 51; and (2) it was held that loss in the ice factory transaction was suffered in the accounting year 1948 49 and assessee 's claim could be sustained only under section 24(2), of the income tax act, 1922, but that the subsection was not applicable, because, the business ceased completely before the commencement of the following accounting year 1949 50 (assessment year 1950 51).
in appeal to this court, held : (1) where a person disposes of a part or the whole of his assets the general 'rule is that the mere change or realization of an investment does not attract liability to income tax, but, where such a realisation is an act which in itself is a trading transaction, profit earned by sale or conversion is taxable.
in determining whether the gain is realization of a mere enhancement of value (capital gain) or is again made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making (revenue) no uniform rule can be evolved.
though a transaction is an isolated one, it may be intimately related to the normal business of the tax payer.
in such a case, the profit arising from the transaction will be out of the tax payer 's business and will be assessable as business profits.
[799 c d. f) 800 b c] prospecting of coal was a part of the mining business which the assessee was carrying on.
therefore, the transaction of prospecting, developing and selling the colliery was one in the nature of business.
797 hence, the profit arising from the sale, though it was an isolated transaction, was in the nature of revenue and liable to tax.

(2) by section 24(1) the loss or profits or gains suffered under any head in any year was liable to be set off in that year against the income, profits or gains under any other head; but by section 24(2) where the loss suffered in any business, profession or vocation could not be wholly set off under sub section
(1) the loss not so set off has to be carried forward to the following year and set off against the profits and gains of the same business in the subsequent year.
l802 f g] in the present case, loss was suffered in the accounting year 1949 50 when the price was settled and not in 1948 49 when the sale took place.
therefore, under section 24(1) the loss was allowable against the business income of the assessee for the accounting year 1949 50, that is, in proceedings for the assessment year 1950 51.
