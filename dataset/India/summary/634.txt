on september 6, 1952, the appellant, who was being tried by an assistant sessions judge and a jury, was caught while giving a bribe to one of the jurors.
by a notification dated november 27, 1952, the government of west bengal, acting under section 4(2) of the west bengal criminal law amendment (special courts) act, 1949, entrusted the case against the appellant under section 161/116 indian penal code to the special judge, burdwan, for trial.
before this date as a result of the introduction of section 165a in the indian penal code by the criminal law amendment act, 1952, providing for punishment for abetment of offences under sections 161 and 165, abetment of section 161 had ceased to be an offence under section 161/116 though it was an offence specified in the schedule to the west bengal act.
the records were received by the special judge on december 23, 1952, and he took cognizance of the case.
on february 10, 1954, a charge under section 165 a indian penal code was framed by the special judge and on july 7, 1954, the appellant was convicted under section 165 a and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months.
an appeal to the high court of calcutta was dismissed.
the appellant obtained special leave and appealed.
held, that the special judge had no jurisdiction to try and convict the appellant for the offence under section 165a indian penal code as when the case was distributed to the special judge section 165a was not one of the offences specified in the schedule of the west bengal act.
the case which was distributed to the special judge was one under section 161/116 indian penal code, an offence which was non existent at that time.
section 165a cannot be deemed to have been specified in the schedule merely because abetment of the offences under sections 161, 162 163 and 165 indian penal code was specifically mentioned in the schedule.
the offence under section 165a is a distinct offence.
it is not merely a restatement of the offence of abetment under section 116 ; it comprises also abetment under section 109 and provides for in enhanced penalty.
this defect of jurisdiction could not be cured by section 529(e) of the code of criminal procedure.
section 529(e) applied to 1277 magistrates and would not apply to special judges whose jurisdiction arose not on their taking cognizance under section 190 of the code but on the case for offences specified in the schedule being distributed to them by the state government by a proper notification.
