the petitioners challenged before the high court the levy of excise duty on the weight of the yarn sized for the purpose of weaving them into fabrics.

the sized yam which is actually put into the integrated process will not again be subjected to payment of excise duty, for the unsized yam which is sized for the purpose, does not change the nature of commodity as yarn.
