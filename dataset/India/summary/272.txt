uttar pradesh food grains (futures and options prohibition) order, 1951, made it illegal and a punishable offence for any person to enter into any futures in pulses other than gram, or to pay or receive or to agree to pay or receive any margin relating to such futures.
by section 9 of that order the order of 1945 containing similar provisions was repealed.
an application under article 32 of 839 the constitution presented by several persons (including the present petitioners) for the enforcement of their fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the constitution to carry on their business and restraining the state from enforcing the order of 1951 in so far as it related to pulses other than gram and for a declaration that section 2(a) of the order read with items 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the schedule thereto was illegal and ultra vires the state government ' succeeded in the supreme court and the state of uttar pradesh was directed by the supreme court by its judgment dated the 15th 'day, 1952, to abstain from giving effect to it.
on the 10th june, 1953, a letter (exhibit b to the petition) was addressed by the deputy commissioner, food, uttar pradesh, to all regional food controllers and deputy food controllers and all district magistrates in uttar pradesh instructing them to regard all futures in foodgrains mentioned in the schedule to the 1945 order including pulses other than gram as punishable.
it was contended on behalf of the state (1) that section 3 of 1946 act which reproduced section 3 of the 1946 ordinance conferred on the central government extensive powers to control production, supply, distribution of and trade and commerce in essential commodities and this power was delegated by the central government to the provincial government by notification dated 21st october, 1946, under section 4 of the 1946 ordinance.
the subsequent amendments made by two notifications dated 5th march, 1947, and dated 15th november, 1947, withdrew the power so delegated only with respect to "edible oils and oil seeds and pulses other than gram" and such withdrawal was only with regard to production, supply, and distribution of those commodities but was not with regard to trade and commerce therein; (ii) that the order of 1951 having been declared ultra vires, the order of 1945 which was continued by section 5 of the ordinance of 1946 and then by section 17 of the act of 1946 was still in force.
held, (repelling the contentions) (i) that as the order of 1945 ceased to have effect with regard to the price, production, distribution and movements of those commodities, that order could not in any way continue to regulate or control trade or commerce in those commodities and the two notifications of 1947 quite effectively superseded the order of 1946 so far as it purported to regulate or control the price, production, distribution and movement of or trade and commerce in edible oils and oil seeds and pulses other than gram; (ii) that the order of 1951 was not declared ultra vires and invalid in its entirety by the judgment of the supreme court dated 15th may, 1952.
the order was declared invalid in so far as it purported to restrict the dealings in edible oils and oil seeds and pulses other than gram.
the rest of the order of 1951 and in particular section 9 thereof by which the order of 1945 had been withdrawn, remained unaffected by the judgment of the supreme court.
840 strong disapproval was expressed by the supreme court of the wholly unwarranted attitude adopted by the officers of the state of uttar pradesh in circumventing the decision of the supreme court on a flimsy pretext.
the contentions advanced on behalf of the state government should have been advanced before the supreme court on the previous occasion when it delivered its judgment dated 15th may, 1952, or the matter should have been brought before the supreme court by way of review if any review was competent.
