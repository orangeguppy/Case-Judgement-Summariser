"actus curiam neminem gravabit ' ' an act of court shall prejudice no man.
[534e] (d) having regard to the time normally consumed for adjudication, the 10 years exemption or holiday from the application of the rent act would become illusory, if the suit has to he filed within that time and be disposed of finally.
[534f] (e) it is common knowledge that unless a suit is instituted soon after the date of letting, it world never be disposed of within 10 years and even then within that time it may not be disposed of.
that will make the 10 years holiday from the rent act illusory and provide no incentive to the landlords to build new holiday to solve problem of shortages of houses.

2.(a) purposive interpretation in a social amelioration legislation is an imperative irrespective of anything else.
[534g] (b) judicial time and energy is more often than not consumed in finding what is the intention of the parliament or in other words, the will of the people.
the fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made, by signs most natural and probable and these signs are either the words, the context, the subject matter, the effects and consequences or the spirit and reasons of the law.
[534h 535a] (c) each word, phrase or sentence has to be construed in the light of the purpose of the act itself but words must be construed with imagination of purpose behind them.
though the court is concerned with seeking of intention, it is rather looking to the meaning of the word that the legislator has used and the true meaning of the words used.
