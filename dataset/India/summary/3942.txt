the appellant who was charged for the offences (a) under section 120b i.p.c. (b) under section 161 i.p.c. read with section 5(2) and 5(1) (d) of the prevention of corruption act 1947 and (c) under section 5(2) read with section 5(1) (a) of the prevention of corruption act 1947 was acquitted by the special judge holding that neither the charge of conspiracy nor any other charge against the accused was proved.
but the special judge held that the assets of the appellant from 1st of july '55 to 30th april 1961 had exceeded his income by rs. 33,588.34 and they were disproportionate to the known sources of income of the petitioner.
the trial judge, however, found that as section 5(3) of the act had been repealed on 18 12 1964 and as specific instances of payment of bribe to the petitioner could not be proved the accused could not be held guilty of the charges.
aggrieved by the decision, the state preferred an appeal to the delhi high court on 11th april, 1967.
pending the appeal before the high court, act no. 16 of 1967, came into force on 5th may 1967 re introducing section 5(1)(e) in the act.
in the high court the appellant challenged the vires of act no. 16 of 1967 on the ground that revival of section 5(3) of the act and making it applicable retrospectively was void and unconstitutional as it was in violation of article 14 and 20(1) of the constitution.
a division bench of the high court of delhi by its judgment dated 27th november, 1973 allowed the appeal upholding the validity of act no. 16 of 1967 and remanded the case to be tried from the stage at which it was pending on 18th december, 1964.
in appeals by special leave it was contended that (a) since section 5(3) of the p. o. f. a., 1947 was repealed on 18 12 64 the court below cannot take into account the provisions of section 5(3) of the act after the date of its repeal on 18 12 64 and (b) act no. 16 of 1964 which gave retrospective operation to section 5(3) of the act is violative of articles 14 and 20(1) of the constitution.
^ held: 1.
whether act 16 of 1967 had been brought into force on 20th june 1967 or not the rule of evidence as incorporated in section 5(3) of the p.o.f.a., 1947 would be available regarding offences that were committed during the period before the repeal of section 5(3).
[823 g] 2.
section 5(3) of the prevention of corruption act, 1947 provided an additional mode of proving an offence punishable under sub sections 5(2) for which an accused person is being tried and, therefore, prescribes a rule of evidence.
section 5(3) does not create a new kind of offence of criminal misconduct by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty.

while repealing section 5(3) by act 40 of 1964 the statute did not say that the section shall be deemed not to have been in force at all.
section 6 of the provides that the repeal shall not affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed unless a different intention appears.
the operation of all the provisions of the prevention of corruption act would continue in so far as the offences that were committed when section 5(3) was in force.
the offences that were committed after the date of the repeal will not come under the provisions of section 6(b) of the .
section 6(c) also preserves all legal proceedings and consequences of such proceedings as if the repealing act had not been passed.

keshavan madhava menon vs state of bombay, [1951] 2 scr followed.
article 20(1) of the constitution deals with ex post facto laws though that expression has not been used in the article.
usually, a law prescribes a rule of conduct by which persons ought to be governed in respect of their civil rights.
certain penalties are also imposed under the criminal law for breach of any law.
though a sovereign legislature has power to legislate retrospectively creation of an offence for an act which at the time of its commission was not an offence or imposition of a penalty greater than that which was under the law provided violates article 20(1).
all that article 20(1) prohibits is ex post facto laws and is designed to prevent a person being punished for an act or omission which was considered innocent when done.
it only prohibits the conviction of a person or his being subjected to a penalty under expost facto laws.
[824 b d].
in the instant case, the appellant cannot object to a procedure different from what obtained at the time of the commission of the offence.
the offence that was committed was when section 5(3) was in force and by act 16 of 1967 the procedure is revived.
it is not as if the procedure is brought into force for the first time.

there can be no objection in law to the revival of the procedure which was in force at the time when the offence was committed.
the effect of the amendment is that sub section (3) of section 5 as it stood before the commencement of 1964 act shall apply and shall be deemed to have always applied in relation to trial of offences.
it may be, if by this deeming provision a new offence was created then the prohibition under article 20(1) may come into operation.
in this case what is done is no more than reiterating the effect of section 6(1) of the .

in the present case the old procedure is revived and no new procedure is given retrospective effect.
the procedure given effect to is not of such a natural as to result in creation of a new offence.
