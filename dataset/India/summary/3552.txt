the respondent took the disputed land on lease for 5 years from the appellant corporation, and held it unautho risedly after the lease period expired.
his suit for a permanent injunction against interference with his posses sion, was dismissed, and his appeal rejected.
the appellant then instituted the suit in appeal, claiming possession.
the suit was decreed and the respondent was directed to deliver possession.
on appeal, the high court remanded the case.
upon remand, the respondent applied for an amendment of his written statement, claiming protection under the karnataka land reforms act, 1961.
he also applied for a stay of the suit by the civil court, and for a reference to the tribunal for deciding whether he was a tenant or not.
the application was dismissed, but on revision, the high court reversed the decision.
the principal question in appeal before this court was whether section 107 of the karnataka land reforms act, 1961, was applicable to the disputed land held by the respondent.
allowing the appeal, the court, held: section 107 of the karnataka land reforms act, 1961 makes it .
quite clear that the only provision which applies to lands belonging to or held on lease or from a local authority is section 8.
there is no dispute that the lease was determined by efflux of time.
the question wheth er the respondent is a tenant or deemed to be a tenant does not arise because the tenancy came 'to an end.
section 8 is not applicable.
therefore no question can be referred for determination by the tribunal under section 133.
section 133 cannot apply where the lease had expired and the local authority sues for possession on the ground that there is unauthorised occupation.
