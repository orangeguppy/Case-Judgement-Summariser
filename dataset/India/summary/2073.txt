in 1936, certain ryotwari lands belonging to the estate of the respondent in madhya bharat were leased for cultivation to the appellants ' father m by the court of wards which was in management of the estate.
after the court of wards released the estate in 1951 the respondent terminated the tenancy and instituted a suit for a decree in ejectment and for mesne profits.
the trial court passed a decree in the respondent 's favour and this was confirmed in appeal by the district court as well as by the high court.
it was contended on, behalf of the appellants that on the coming into force of the madhya pradesh land revenue code, 1954, m acquired the status of an occupancy tenant as he held land of the nature described by section 185(1).
on the other hand it was the respondent 's contention that even though a ryotwari sub lessee might acquire the status of an occupancy tenant; the tenant m was disentitled to that status since at the commencement of the tenancy the respondent, was subject to a disability of the character set out in section 168(2).
accordingly, the case fell within the exception to section 185(1) provided in sub section
(3) of that section.
by virtue of section 185(1), m became an occupancy tenant of the land when the code was brought into operation; the appeal must therefore be allowed and the respondent 's suit dismissed.
[426 e] for the exemption from the operation of section 185(1) to apply, it had to be established that the respondent at the commencement of the code belonged to the disabled class.
although being a minor he belonged to the disabled class at the time when the lease w ; granted, he did not belong to the disabled class at the commencement of the code.
what is decisive for the operation of the exemption under section 185(3) read with section 168(2) is the status at the commencement of the code.
