the appellant firm was assessed to sales tax under the pro visions of the bihar sales tax, 1944, for three periods commencing from october 1, 1947, and ending on march 31, 1050.
its claim for certain deductions was disallowed, and its applications in revision under section 24 of the act to the board of revenue, bihar, were dismissed by three orders dated august 20, 1953, september 3, 1953 and april 30, 1954.
under section 25(1) of the act the appellant applied to the board to state a case to the high court of patna on certain questions of law, but the applications were dismissed by order dated august 30, 1954, on the ground that no questions of law arose.
the appellant then moved the high court for requiring the board to state a case on the said questions of law.
the high court dismissed the applications in respect of the first two periods of assessment, but by order dated november 17, 1934, directed the board to state a 277 case in regard to the third period on one of the questions of law which only, in its opinion, arose.
by its judgment dated january 21, 1957, the high court answered the question against the appellant.
on february 17, 1955, the appellant made applications to the supreme court for special leave to appeal against the orders of the board of revenue dated august 20, 953, and september 3, 1953, in respect of the first two periods; and on april 12, 1955, it similarly applied for special leave in respect of the third period.
leave was granted in respect of all the three applications by order dated december 23, 1955, the leave granted in regard to the third period being confined to the order of the board dated august 30, 1954.
when the appeals came up for hearing the question was raised as to whether the appeals were maintainable in view of the fact that no applications for leave to appeal were filed against the orders of the board of revenue and the high court subsequent to the orders of the board in respect of which only special leave had been granted.
held, that though the words of article 136 of the constitution of india are wide, the supreme court has uniformly held as a rule of practice that there must be exceptional and special circumstances to justify the exercise of the discretion under that article.
