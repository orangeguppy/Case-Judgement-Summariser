under section 72 of the 9th sch.
of the government of india act, 1935: " the governor general may, in cases of emergency, make and promulgate ordinances . and any ordinance so made shall, for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation, have the like force of law as an act passed by the indian legislature . " ; section i (3) of the india and burma (emergency provisions) act, 1940, provided that section 72 of the government of india act, 1935, shall as respects ordinances made during the period beginning with june 27, 1940, the date of the passing of that act, and ending with such date as his majesty may by order in council declare to be the end of the emergency, have effect as if 635 the words " for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation " were omitted.
the appellant was prosecuted for having on july 11, 1953, contravened the provisions of section 4 of the high denomination bank notes (demonetisation) ordinance, 1946.
the ordinance was promulgated by the governor general of india on january 12, 1946, but on april 1, 1946, an order in council was published in the gazette of india extraordinary whereby the period of emergency referred to in the india and burma (emergency provisions) act, 1940, was declared to have ended on april 1, 1946.
it was contended for the appellant that the ordinance in question was not in operation on the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed and that therefore the prosecution was not maintainable, because (1) the ordinance had been promulgated in exercise of the emergency powers and that it lapsed ipso facto on april 1, 1946, when the declaration was made that the emergency was at an end; and (2) section 72 of the 9th sch.
of the government of india act, 1935, having been restored with effect from april 1, 1946, one must look to its terms as they originally stood, to justify the continuance of the ordinance after april i, 1946.
held, that the deletion of the words " for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation " from section 72 of the 9th sch.
of the government of india act, 1935, by section 1 (3) of the india and burma (emergency provisions) act, 1940, had the effect of equating ordinances which were promulgated between june 27, 1940, and april i, 1946, with acts passed by the indian legislature without any limitation of time as regards their duration, and therefore continuing in force until they were repealed.
though after april i, 1946, section 72 of the 9th sch.
of the government of india act, 1935, was restored in its original form, the continuance of the ordinance in question after that date had to be determined having regard to the terms of the section as they stood on the date of such promulgation, as there was nothing to justify retrospective operation of the section so restored.
