the respondent was defendant in a suit.
he engaged the appellant as an advocate.
the suit was compromised on 14.6.77 ordering that out of the amount lying with the court receiver, plaintiff was to be paid a sum of rs. 64,000 and the balance to be paid to the defendant respondent and possession of suit property to be handed over to the respondent.
during the tendency of the suit the court receiver inducted a tenant in a suit property.
the tenant filed a suit praying for an interim injunction restraining the court receiver from handing over possession to the respondent.
tenant 's suit was continued.
after the compromise decree was passed on 14.6.77, the appellant withdrew a total amount of rs. 50,379 from the court receiver.
out of the amount, appellant paid only rs. 18,000 to the respondent.
on 9.1.81 the respondent filed a complaint against the appellant before the bar council of india.
on receiving a notice, the appellant submitted reply.
the disciplinary committee of the bar council rejected certain receipts produced to evidence payment to the respondent and also the plea of the appellant that the account books were lost.
the committee suspended the appellant for a period of two years and further directed to pay a sum of rs. 500 to the respondent.
before this court the order of the disciplinary committee of the bar council of india was challenged contending that the committee did not properly appreciate the evidence and that it was incorrect to hold that the 1007 receipt dated 8.8.77 was a suspicious document merely because the account books were not produced.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held : 1.01.
advocacy is not a craft but a calling , a profession wherein devotion to duty constitutes the hall mark.
sincerity of performance and the earnestness of endeavor are the two wings that will bare aloft the advocate to the tower of success.
given these virtues other qualifications will follow of their own account.
this is the reason why legal profession is regarded to be a noble one.
but it cannot be allowed to become a sorriest of trades.
therefore.
an exacting standard is what is expected of an advocate.
[1010 c d, 1011 c] 1.02.
the members of the noble profession must set an example of conduct worthy of emulation.
if any of them falls from the high expectations, the punishment has to be commensurate with the degree and gravity of the misconduct.

the appellant had withdrawn the money from the court receiver.
none of the correspondence addressed to the respondent mentioned about the receipt dated 8th of august, 1977.
the plea taken by the appellant based on the receipt is clearly false.
the statement of the appellant that the account books had been lost in transit cannot be believed.
under these circumstances this is a clear case wherein the misappropriation by the appellant has been fully established.
[1012 f] 2.02.
the appellant has been withdrawing the money over 14 years and lit has illegally retained the amount.
out of a sum of rs. 50,379 which was admittedly withdrawn from the court receiver only rs. 18,000 was paid on different occasions.
still a sum of rs. 22,379 is due.
[1012 h, 1013 a] 2.03.
in view of the established finding of misappropriation the proper punishment will be the name of the advocate must be struck off the rolls.
[1013 b] 1008 2.04.
when section 38 of the advocates act says, 'deems fit", it must be construed as to meet the ends of justice.
the respondent should not be driven to a civil court for recovery of this amount even when the appellant has been found guilty.
therefore, it is directed that there shall be a decree in favour of the respondent (complainant) for a sum of rs. 22,379 together with interest at 9% per annum from the date of the complaint till the date of payment 11013 f g]
