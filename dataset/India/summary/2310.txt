(ii) however, when the appellant struck the deceased with the knife, he must have known that the deceased then being in a bent position, the blow would land in the abdomen or near it a vulnerable ' part of the human body and that such a blow was likely to result in his death.
in these circumstances it would be quite legitimate to hold that he struck the deceased with the knife with the intention to cause an injury likely to cause death.
the offence, therefore.
clearly fell under section 304 part 1.
