the respondent, the sole inamdar of village chinnaven katapuram in the parlakimidi zamindari in the district of srikakulam filed a writ petition before the high court chal lenging lnter alia the notification issued under section 3 (4) of the madras estates land (reduction of rent) act by which the rents in respect of ryoti lands included in his estate were reduced.
he also challenged the provisions of the act.
the high court accepted the challenge to the notification on the ground that the net income from rents was reduced to less than 25% of the original income and that the reduction was so substantial as to amount to an unreasonable restriction on the respondent 's right to hold property under article 19 (1) (f ) of the constitution.
on appeal by a certificate.
held, that the provisions of the act were valid as they laid down reasonable restrictions in the interest of ameliorating the conditions of tenants of ryoti land in 'estates ' who were at a disadvantage compared to tenants of ryotwari lands.
held, further, that it is only in a theoretical case where a land holder would be virtually ' deprived of his income by the reduction of rents that it can be said that the reduction was unreasonable.
by the reduction the income of the respondent was brought on a par with that of the highest prevailing rents in ryotwari lands and so it cannot be said that the reduction of rents made by the notification was violative of the land holders ' rights under article 19 (f ).
the method of comparing the rents prior to reduction with the rents after reduction for the purpose of deciding the unreasonableness of the restriction was not sound as not humane landholders but those who were charging unconscionable rents would benefit thereby.
