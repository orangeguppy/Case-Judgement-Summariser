in construing a document whether in english or in vernacular the fundamental rule is to ascertain the inten tion from the words used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered but that is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the words which have actually been employed.
to convey an absolute estate to a hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words of such amplitude are used as would convey full rights of ownership.
the term 'malik ' when used in a will or other document as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to held, has been held apt to describe in owner possessed of full proprietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surrounding circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended be conferred to 767 the mere fact that a gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could not be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time.
the extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as ex pressed by the language used, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest.
the desire to provide maintenance or rcsidence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a measure of the extent of the gift.

meria aforesaid, widow of chhedi lal and made her the owner (malik) " ' held, that there was nothing in the context of the document or in the surrounding circumstances which would displace the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the words 'malik ' is apt ordinarily to convey and the daughter in law obtained under the gift deed a full heritable and transferable title to t, he properties con veyed thereby.
