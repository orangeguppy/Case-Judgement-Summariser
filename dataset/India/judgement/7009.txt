p. chidambaram, pallay shishodia, a.p. medh and r.m. tahija for the respondents.
the judgment of the court was delivered by verma, j.
leave granted.
these appeals by special leave are by the state of rajasthan and certain candidates whose promotions are adversely affected by the impugned judgment of the rajasthan high court.
the dispute in the writ petitions filed in the high court was between members of the rajasthan educational service belonging to group 'e ' and group 'f pertaining to their rival claims for promotion to the posts of principal higher secondary school, which posts are in group 'd ', section ii of the rajasthan educational service.
the dispute between these two groups arises from the fact that in the rajasthan educational service rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as 'the rules '), the aforesaid two groups 'e ' and 'f ' are clubbed together as the feeder cadre for promotion to group 'd ', section ii, even though in the service hierarchy the lowest is group 'f ', above which is group 'e ' and then comes group 'd '.
in the writ petitions filed in the high court, the writ petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of this provision in the rules clubbing together group 'e ' and group 'f for the purpose of promotion to group 'd '.
section ii on the ground that unequals had been equated.
the high court has allowed these writ petitions and held that item no. 1(a) in column 5 under the head "group 'd ' section ii" of 1091 schedule 1 to the rules as also item no. 1 in schedule 11 under the head 'group 'd ' section 11" in column 5 are unconstitutional, being violative of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution.
accordingly, the high court has quashed the orders promoting members of group 'f to posts in the group 'd '.
it is this judgment dated 3.9.1991 of the rajasthan high court which is challenged in these appeals by special leave by the state of rajasthan and members belonging to group 'f of the service whose promotions are quashed.
before we refer to the relevant provisions, mention may be made of the rival contentions before us shri p.p. rao, learned counsel for the aggrieved group 'f teachers, advanced several arguments.
he submits that the rules require preparation of a combined seniority list of an eligible members of group 'e ' and 'f and prescribed the placing of those in group 'e ' en bloc above the persons belonging to group 'f; and it is also prescribed that amongst those selected for promotion to group 'd ', the pre existing inter se seniority within the group and also between the two groups is to be maintained, that is, all those from group 'e ' are to rank above those from group 'f. he submits that the interpretation and working of the rules in this manner, which is the case of the state government, is in consonance with articles 14 and 16 of the constitution.
his next submission is that reservation of a percentage of the promotion quota to be filled exclusively on the basis of merit does not violate the guarantee of equality since it promotes the object of greater efficiency as those considered in the merit quota are all qualified and eligible for promotion.
his further submission is that rule 25(5) applies to promotion to the next higher grade from the lowest grade while rule 25 (6) applies to promotions to all other higher grades.
in other words, for promotion from group 'f to group 'e ', rule 25(5) applies while for promotion from group 'f directly to group 'd ': rule 25(6) applies.
he also submitted that rule 23a does not apply where promotion to a higher grade is from more than one grade.
shri aruneshwar gupta, appearing for the state of rajasthan, adopted the arguments of shri rao.
he also submitted that the writ petitioners having appeared for interview before the d.p.c. and taken their chance, they are precluded from making the challenge when they failed to get selected.
shri v.m. tarkunde, who appeared for one of the aggrieved appellants, supported shri rao and made some more submissions.
shri tarkunde submitted that the difference between members of group 'f and group 'e ' is not substantial since both of them had been 1092 functioning as headmasters and discharging similar duties so that they were equally suitable and qualified for promotion as principal of a higher secondary school.
shri tankunde submitted that no person belonging ' to group 'e ' found suitable for promotion to group 'd ' was left out and, therefore, filling the remaining vacancies from amongst suitable and qualified persons belonging to group 'f ' cannot be violative of the rights, if any, of those in group 'e ' who were not promoted because they were not found suitable for promotion.
learned counsel also submitted that qualitatively those promoted from group 'f ' were, according to the service record, not inferior to persons lower down in group 'e 'who had not been selected and the principle of equation adopted was fair to all.
it was also shown with reference to the particulars of those not selected for promotion from group 'e ' and those found suitable for promotion in group 'f ' that the principle adopted and applied was fair and reasonable, with no element of arbitrariness.
in reply, shri pallay shishodia, learned counsel for the respondents, who arc persons not selected for promotion from group 'e ' to group 'd ', attempted to support the impugned judgment.
in all, there were 14 such persons who filed the three writ petitions in the high court.
the main argument of shri shishodia is that ex facie clubbing of group 'f ', a lower cadre, with group 'e ' for promotion to group 'd '.
section ii, violates the equality clause.
shri shishodia contended that the explanation now given by the state government to justify the promotions made is not based on a policy adopted and followed, but on the fortuitous circumstances which have emerged from the results of the promotions.
shri shishodia also submitted that the yardstick was applied equally rigidly to members of group 'e ' as to those from 'f ' when it should have been more stringent for those in group 'f ' which was a lower grade.
in order to satisfy ourselves that the policy adopted by the state government was fair in its application to members of both group 'e ' and group 'f, we directed the state government to produce the relevant material including the particulars of candidates selected for promotion and those not found fit for promotion in group 'e ', as also the guidelines followed.
on examination.
of those details, we are satisfied that the net result of the working of the rules in accordance with the principle adopted has been fair and it cannot be held that those not selected for promotion in group 'e ' have been dealt with unfairly, in any manner, to justify 1093 quashing the promotions made at this selection.
we may, however, observe that it would be advisable for the state government to lay down more clearly its policy for the future to avoid even the semblance of treating unequals as equals for the purpose of promotion, in consonance with the well known maxim that 'justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done.
we do hope that the state government would take advantage of the experience gained from this litigation to dispel the misapprehension from the minds of a section of its employees who think that the state 's action is not fair.
obviously the high court was denied the benefit of the material which the state government placed before us, on our directions, which enabled us to remove the gloss of seeming inequality in the policy adopted under the rules read with the guidelines for its working.
we may first refer to the relevant parts of the rajasthan educational service rules, 1970.

the existing sub rule (6) of the relevant rules regarding revised procedure for promotion, provides for promotion to certain categories of posts on the basis of "seniority cummerit" and "merit" in the ratio of 50:50.
these rules do not clearly indicate whether selections for such categories of post shall be made first on the basis or "seniority cummerit" or on the basis of "merit '.
the matter has been considered by the government and 1104 the following procedure should be followed "the number of posts to be filled separately on the basis of seniority cum merit and merit should be determined in accordance with the explanation below sub rule (6) of the rule laying down the revised criteria of eligibility, promotion etc.

" xxx xxx xxx" the high court examined the scheme of these rules and pointed out that even though the writ petitions before it concerned schedule i to the rules relating to the boys ' institutions, yet the principle was enqually 1105 applicable for schedule ii relating to the girls ' institutions, since the hierarchy of the grades in both the schedules is the same.
the lowest grade in schedule i is group 'f '.
item 1(a) of group 'f is the post of headmaster.
secondary school for boys.
it is to be filled 50 per cent by direct recruitment and 50 per cent by promotion from the lower grade.
the minimum qualifications are prescribed in column 4 and the post or posts from which promotion is to be made is shown in column 5 which is teachers in grade 1, 11 and teachers grade i in sections c, d, e, f of the schedule appended to the rajasthan education subordinate service rules, 1971.
the next higher grade is group 'e ' which are posts of headmaster, higher secondary school for boys under item 1(a) to be filled 100 per cent by promotion from group 'f ' posts.
the minimum qualification and experience required for this grade is master 's degree in addition to those prescribed for headmasters secondary school.
accord ingly, only such of the headmasters of secondary school for boys belonging to group 'f ' who possess master 's degree in addition to the qualifications prescribed for that post are eligible for promotion as headmaster, higher secondary school for boys under groups 'e '.
the next higher grade is group 'd ', section ii of schedule i and in item 1(a) there under are the posts of principal, higher secondary school/bstc/rtc (boys).
these posts are to be filled 100 per cent by promotion from groups 'e ' and 'f ' posts; and the qualifications prescribed are the same as those for headmaster of higher secondary school.
above this grade is group 'd ', section i, in item 1 of which is the post of inspector of schools, which is to be filled 100 per cent by promotion from group 'd ', section ii posts.
then comes group 'c ', above which is group 'b ' which is the highest post of joint director of education range in schedule i to be filled 100 per cent by promotion from group 'c '.
from the hierarchy of posts in schedule i indicated above, it is clear that the lowest grade of group 'f ' in schedule i is filled 50 per cent by direct recruitment and 50 per cent by promotion, while all the higher grades are filled entirely by promotion from the next lower grade, except for group 'd '.
section ii, which is filled by promotion for groups 'e 'and 'f taken together.
in other words, the posts of principal.
higher secondary school in group 'd ', section ii are filled 100 per cent by promotion from groups 'e 'and 'f 'together, that is, headmaster, higher secondary school 1106 and headmaster, secondary school; and those from group 'f are considered only if they have the minimum qualifications prescribed for appointment to group 'd ', section ii.
it is this clubbing of groups 'e ' and 'f ' for promotion to group 'd ', section ii which was successfully challenged in the writ petitions filed before the high court.
the high court has taken the view that clubbing of groups 'f and 'e ' together for promotion to the next higher post in group 'd ' section ii, amounts to clubbing of unequals and the rule to this extent is invalid.
the contention of the state has been rejected wherein it was indicated that a common seniority list was prepared of persons in groups 'e ' and 'f with those in group 'e ' being placed en bloc above those in group 'f '; that persons in group 'f ' were considered for promotion only after every one in group 'e ' had been considered and vacancies remained to be filled on account of suitable persons not being found in group 'e ' to fill those vacancies; persons form group 'f were considered only then, subject to the prescribed qualifications for appointment to group 'd '.
section ii; and the nature of functions of both the categories of headmasters being similar, their equation for this purpose was considered to be reasonable.
the high court did not accept this as sufficient justification to consider persons in group 'f ' for filling the remaining vacancies in group 'd ' section ii even when the remaining persons of group 'e ' were not found suitable for promotion.
the high court also appears to have overlooked the fact that all posts in group 'd ', section ii being required to be filled by promotion, there was no other avenue to fill the remaining vacancies in group section ii except the next lower cadre of group 'f for want of adequate number of suitable person in group 'e ' for appointment to group 'd '.
the question really is : whether the policy adopted by the state government of first considering all the persons in groups 'e ' for promotion to group 'd ', section ii and promoting all found suitable, and then only considering the qualified persons in group 'f 'for appointment to the remaining vacancies for want of suitable persons in group "e ' for promotion, when the posts in group 'd ' section ii are required to be filled 100 per cent by promotion, is invalid for any reason? it is in this perspective that the dispute between members of group 'e ' and group 'f ' of the service raised in the present case has to be decided.
obviously, the grievance of members of group 'e ' can arise only if those in group 'f ' are 1107 treated on par with group 'e ' which is a higher grade or members of group 'f ' get appointments by promotion in group 'd ' which would otherwise have gone to those in group 'e ' but for the rule making group 'f also eligible for promotion to group 'd ' by clubbing groups 'e ' and 'f ' together for this purpose.
there can be no legitimate grievance to members of group 'e ' in case vacancies remain to be filled in group 'd ' which can be filled only by promotion, after every one in group 'e ' has been considered and only those not found fit for promotion therein are left unpromoted.
the appointment to the remaining vacancies by promotion of members of group 'p, the next lower cadre, possessing the prescribed qualifications and found suitable for promotion cannot result in inequality or injustice to those remaining in group 'e ' on account of their unsuitability.
there is no other available avenue to fill the remaining posts in group 'd ' by promotion.
there can be no legitimate claim of an unsuitable person for promotion to provide foundation for the challenge so made.
it is for this reason that we required the state government to place before us the material indicating the procedure followed for making the selection for promotion to the posts in group 'd ' section ii from groups 'e ' and 'f ' of the service.
it has been shown with reference to full particulars that it is only the vacancies in group 'd ' remaining unfilled for want of suitable persons in group 'e ' which are filled by appointment of persons found suitable in group 'f ' who possess the prescribed qualifications and are also found outstanding.
it does appear to be the only feasible manner in which the remaining vacancies in group 'd ' can be fined since promotion from the services is the only prescribed mode of filling of the posts in group "d '.
moreover, the nature of duties and functions of the post of principal, higher secondary school in group 'd ', section ii is similar to that of headmaster of a higher secondary school or secondary school, which are the posts held by persons in groups 'e ' and 'f respectively.
that apart, an unsuitable person in group 'e ' cannot claim placement above a qualified and suitable person in group 'f ', when the nature of duties of both are alike and so is that of the higher post in group d ' in order to assure ourselves that the principle adopted was fair and reasonable and so was its application in making the promotions to group d ', section ii from groups 'e ' and 'f, we also directed the filing of an affidavit by a senior officer giving all the relevant particulars in addition to 1108 production of a chart which would enable comparison of persons in group 'e ' who were not found suitable for promotion to group 'd ', section ii with those in group 'f ' who were found fit for promotion on the basis of merit.
on a scrutiny of these particulars along with the facts stated in the affidavit of m.r. advani, deputy legal remembrancer, education department, government of rajasthan.
we are satisfied that the principle adopted and followed was fair and reasonable and does not result in any injustice to the persons not found fit in group 'e ' for promotion.
the affidavit of m.r. advani shows that the duties of the office of principal as well as headmaster are of a similar nature and there is no qualitative difference in the duties performed by persons belonging to groups 'e ' and 'f '.
it has also been stated that the reporting officer for the purpose of annual performance appraisal of persons in group 'e ' is the principal and their reviewing officer is the district education officer, while in the case of persons belonging to group 'f ', the reporting officer is the district education officer and the reviewing officer is the deputy director/joint director.
prior to introduction of 10 + 2 scheme, the reporting officer for group 'e ' persons also was the district education officer and the reviewing officer was the deputy director/joint director.
this shows that the standard of their annual performance appraisal is also on par, being made in this manner.
paras 10 and 11 of this affidavit dated 15.10.1992 read as under: "10.it is respectfully submitted that pursuant to the subrule (11) of rule 25 of the 1970 rules while considering the merits of candidates the departmental promotion committee first considered all the candidates of category 'e. ' who were in the zone of consideration and every candidate who had 5 or more 'very good ' or 'outstanding ' report and not having any adverse report was selected on merit.
11.after considering all the candidates of category 'e ' the posts which were left unfilled were filled by considering the merits of candidates of category 'f '.
while considering the merits of category 'f ' candidates, first of all candidates having 5 or more :outstanding ' and 'very good ' acr were selected.
if the number of vacancies are less, the merit list 1109 is prepared on the basis of those having 6 or an 7 acrs to be 'outstanding ' or 'very good '.
for the year 1989 90 as sufficient vacancies were available in d 11 category all e and f category candidates were promoted who had required minimum merit." along with the particulars relating to all the candidates from groups 'e ' and 'f considered for promotion to group 'd '.
section ii, an additional affidavit dated 21.10.1992 was filed on behalf of the state government by b.c. bairathi wherein para 4 is as under: "4.
it is respectfully submitted that it is evident from the statement that all candidates of category 'e ' who were in the zone of consideration and had 5 or more 'outstanding ' and 'very good ' reports and did not have any adverse reports have been selected on merits.
the leftout candidates in group 'e ' are only those who had less than 5 'outstanding 'or 'verygood 'reports and they could not have been selected on merits pursuant to the express provisions of rule 25(11) of the 1970 rules.
it is also evident from the said statements that all candidates of category 'f who have been appointed had 5 or more outstanding 'and 'very good 'acrs and none of them had less than 5 'outstanding ' or 'very good ' acrs.
" the explanation to rule 25(11) as amended vide notification dated 30.11.1991 prescribes that for such promotion no one having less than 5 outstanding/very good annual confidential reports in the immediate preceding 7 years is to be considered fit for promotion.
the facts clearly show that every one in group 'e ' satisfying this criterion has been selected and those not found suitable in group 'e ' are persons who do not satisfy this criterion.
vacancies remained in group 'd '.
section ii which could not, therefore, be filled from persons in group 'e ' since suitable persons amongst them were not available.
the only manner in which the remaining vacancies in group 'd ', section ii could be filled, since all vacancies were to be filled by promotion according to the rules, was by promoting the outstanding persons from group 'f. the duties and functions of persons in groups 'e ' and 'f being of a similar nature, consideration of persons 1110 from group f ' for filling the remaining vacancies in this situation was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary but the only available mode left for filling the remaining vacancies.
it also appears that the outstanding persons selected from group 'f ' were qualitatively found superior to those remaining unselected in group 'e ', particularly in view of the express requirement of the explanation to rule 25(11) which the unsuitable persons in group 'e ' did not satisfy.
in chiranjit lal chowdhuri vs the union of india and others, ; , while dealing with the right to equality, fazil ali.
j. indicated that a doctrinaire approach is not warranted and a passage from constitutional law by prof. willis was cited as a correct proposition of the principle underlying this guarantee where in it was stated as under: ". .
mathematical nicety and perfect equality are not required.
similarity, not identity of treatment, is enough.
if any state of facts can reasonably be conceived to sustain a classification, the existence of that state of facts must be assumed.
one who assails a classification must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis." (p.877) in mohd. hanif quareshi & others vs the state of bihar, ; , while dealing with the meaning, scope and effect of article 14, it was reiterated that 'in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and may assumed every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation '.
the validity of the impugned rules has to be adjudged in this background.
the challenge to the validity, upheld by the high court, was on the only ground that clubbing of groups 'e ' and 'f ' for promotion to group 'd ', section ii was invalid, since unequals had been equated for the purpose of promotion.
from the undisputed facts, it is clear that the total number of posts in group 'd ', section ii is nearly the same as the total number of posts in group 'e ', while the total number of posts in group 'f ' is about five times thereof.
since appointment to group 'd ', section ii is 100 per cent by promotion.
it is a distinct possibility, as in the present case, that the requisite number of suitable candidates from group 'e ' may 1111 not be available to fill all the existing vacancies in group 'd ', section ii.
in such a situation, all appointments to group 'd ', section ii posts being by promotion, the only available option is to fill the remaining vacancies by selection of outstanding persons from group 'f.
this is more so because the nature of duties and functions of the posts in groups 'e ' and 'f ' is similar and so is that of the posts in group 'd ' section ii.
in such a situation, the provision made.
in the rules for promotion to group 'd '.
section ii from group 'e ' as well as group 'f ' does not in any manner offend the guarantee of equality in the constitution.
the manner in which the rule is worked, that is, consideration first of all persons in group 'e ' for promotion to group 'd ', section ii and moving to group 'f ', if necessary, for filling only the remaining vacancies by selecting outstanding amongst them who satisfy the requirement of explanation to rule ensures fairness lo all while also maintaining efficiency in the administration.
if the need arises to look to group 'f ' for filling the remaining vacancies on account of want of suitable persons in group 'e ', those found unsuitable in group 'e ' cannot complain of discrimination if persons duly qualified and more suitable performing similar functions are selected, since the unsuitable left out in group 'e ' are excluded from the competition on the ground of unsuitability, and cease to remain contenders for the remaining posts.
these provisions in the rules are, therefore, not in any manner violative of articles 14 or 16 of the constitution.
reference may also be made to md. usman & ors.
vs state of andhra pradesh & ors.
, [1971] supp.
s.c.r. 549, wherein clubbing of udcs and ldcs for recruitment to posts of grade ii sub registrars was upheld as valid.
the contention there was that the rule permitting the clubbing violated article 14 of the constitution by treating unequals as equals.
the high court struck down the rule as violative of article 14, but this court reversed that decision and upheld validity of the rule.
it was held by this court that the promotion based on the principles of seniority cum merit, even though the position of udc is superior to that of ldc, satisfies the guarantee of equality.
in the present case, this decision applies with greater force since the selection from group 'f ' is based purely on merit and it is only the outstanding from the group who are promoted.
1112 for the aforesaid reasons, we allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment of the high court with the result that the writ petitions filed in the high court stand dismissed.
no costs.
r.p. appeals allowed.
