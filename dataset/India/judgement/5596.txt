that being so, no writ of mandamus can lie.
the president of india as a constitutional functionary has discharged his duties under article 217(3) of the constitution and the decision must rest on the advice of the chief justice of india and not the council of ministers.
as laid down in the union of india vs jyoti prakash mitter,.
[1971] 3 scr at 503 & 504, the matter as to the age of the chief justice or a sitting judge of a high court is a judicial function of the president of india, which has to be discharged in accordance with the special provisions made under article 217(3) of the constitution.
such a question as to the age of the chief justice or a judge under article 217(3) of the constitution is beyond the reach of the council of ministers under article 74 of the constitution.
j.c. shah, c.j., speaking for the constitution bench has laid down the law in these words: it is necessary to observe that the president in whose name all executive functions of the union are performed is by article 217(3) invested with judicial power of great significance which has bearing on the independence of the judges of the higher courts.
the president is by article 74 of the constitution the constitutional head who acts on the advice of the council of ministers. " the question as to the age of shri k. bhaskaran, the chief justice of the andhra pradesh high court must, therefore, be decided by the president of india on the advice of the chief justice of india as enjoined by article 217(3) of the constitution in the light of the principles laid down by this court in jyoti prakash mitter 's, case.
the high court, in our considered opinion, should have thrown out the petition under article 226 of the constitution at the very threshold because the president of india was seized with the question under article 217(3) of the constitution.
indeed, it appears from the judgment of the 731 high court that when the learned counsel for the union of india a informed the court that the president of india is seized with the question, the counsel for the appellant conceded that the writ of quo warranto is not maintainable.
the special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.
