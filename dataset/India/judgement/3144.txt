solicitor general of india, a. n. kirpal, section p. nayar and r.n. sachthey for the respondent.
the judgment of the court was delivered by hegde, j.
this is an appeal by special leave.
the appellant is the assesssee.
in this case we are concerned with his assessment for the assessment year 1958 59.
the relevant previous year ended on march 31, 1958.
the assesses firm applied for renewal of its registration under section 26(a) of the indian income tax act 1922 (in short 'the act ') before the income tax officer on may 26, 1958.
in that application he mentioned that the previous years ' income had been divided among the partners.
the income tax officer rejected that application.
he did not believe the version of the assessee that the previous years ' income 77 had been divided.
in appeal, the appellate assistant commissioner agreed with the conclusion reached by the income tax officer.
on a further appeal being taken to the income tax appellate tribunal the tribunal agreed with the conclusions reached by the lower authorities.
before the tribunal yet another contention appears to have been taken.
that contention was that at any rate the partners having divided the income of the previous year as evidenced by the balance sheet before the assessment was made, the assessee firm was entitled for its registration under section 26(a).
the tribunal did not go into that question.
the high court agreed with the view taken by the tribunal.
the only question that arises for decision in this case is whether it was incumbent on the part of the assessee to have divided the profits of the previous year before it made its application for renewal of the registration certificate.
for deciding this question it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the act as well as the rules.
section 26 (a) of the act reads.
thus. "26a. procedure in registration of firms (1) application may be made to the income tax officer on behalf of any firm, constituted under an instrument of partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners, for registration for the purposes of this act and of any other enactment for the time being in force relating to income tax or super tax.
(2) the application shall be made by such person or persons, and at such times and small contain such particulars and shall be in such form, and be verified in such manner, as may be prescribed; and it shall be dealt with by the income tax officer in such manner as may be prescribed.
" turning to the relevant rules, they are found in rules 2, 3 and 6.
these rules read thus: "rule 2 any firm constituted under an instrument of partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners may, under the provisions of section 26a of the indian income tax act, 1922 (hereinafter in these rules referred to as the act), register with the incometax officer, the particulars contained in the said instrument on application made in this behalf.

from a reading of these provisions it is clear that in the case of an application for renewal it is incumbent on the part of the assessee to have divided the previous year 's profits.
this conclusion appears to be obvious from section 26(a) read with rules 2, 3, 6 and the forms set out earlier.
the contention ' of mr. sharma, the learned counsel for the assessee, that if the relevant provisions are interpreted in the manner that we have done it leads to hardship to the assessee, is not relevant in view of the plain language of the provisions.
our conclusion in this regard receives support from the decision of madras high court in surajmall vs commissioner of, l63lsup cl/73 82 income tax, madras(1), and that of the allahabad high court in ganesh lal laxmi narain vs commissioner of income tax, u.p.(2).
in khanjan lal sewak ram vs commissioner of income tax, u.p.(3) this court had ruled that para 3 of rule 6 (supra) is mandatory.
we see no merit in this appeal.
it is dismissed with costs.
v.p.s. appeal dismissed.
