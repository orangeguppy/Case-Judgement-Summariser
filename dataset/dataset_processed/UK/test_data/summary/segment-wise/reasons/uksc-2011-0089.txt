the rule in hastings-bass the rule in hastings-bass, properly understood, depends on breach of duty in the performance of something that is within the scope of the trustees powers, not in the trustees doing something that they had no power to do at all [43]. the rule is centred on the failure of trustees to perform their decision-making function. it is that which founds the courts jurisdiction to intervene if it thinks fit to do so [91]. as a matter of principle there must be a high degree of flexibility in the range of the courts possible responses. to lay down a rigid rule would inhibit the court in seeking the best practical solution in the application of the rule in hastings-bass in a variety of different factual situations [92]. for the rule in hastings-bass to apply, the inadequate deliberation on the part of the trustees must be sufficiently serious as to amount to a breach of fiduciary duty. it is generally only a breach of duty on the part of the trustees that entitles the court to intervene. it is not enough to show that the trustees deliberations have fallen short of the highest possible standards, or that the court would, on a surrender of discretion by the trustees, have acted in a different way. apart from exceptional circumstances (such as an impasse reached by honest and reasonable trustees) only breach of fiduciary duty justifies judicial intervention [73]. however, where trustees have been in breach of duty by exercising a discretion with inadequate deliberation, setting aside their decision may not be the only course open to the court [63]. it would be contrary to principle and authority to impose a form of strict liability on trustees who conscientiously obtain and follow, in making a decision which is within the scope of their powers, apparently competent professional advice which turns out to be wrong [80]. such a result cannot be achieved by the route of attributing any fault on the part of professional advisers to the trustees as their supposed principals [81]. there have been, and no doubt will be in the future, cases in which small variations in the facts lead to surprisingly different outcomes. that is inevitable in an area where the law has to balance the need to protect beneficiaries against aberrant conduct by trustees (the policy behind the rule in hastings-bass) with the competing interests of legal certainty, and of not imposing too stringent a test in judging trustees decision-making [83]. rescission on the ground of mistake the true requirement for rescission on the ground of mistake is simply for there to be a causative mistake of sufficient gravity. the test will normally be satisfied only when there is a mistake either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction, or as to some matter of fact or law which is basic to the transaction [122]. consequences (including tax consequences) are relevant to the gravity of a mistake [132]. a mistake must be distinguished from mere ignorance, inadvertence, and misprediction [104]. forgetfulness, inadvertence or ignorance is not, as such, a mistake, but it can lead to a false belief or assumption which the law will recognise as a mistake [105]. mere ignorance, even if causative, is insufficient [108]. however, the distinctions may not be clear on the facts of a particular case [109]. in order to satisfy the test for setting aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake, the gravity of the mistake must be assessed by a close examination of the facts. the injustice of leaving a mistaken disposition uncorrected must be evaluated objectively, but with an intense focus on the facts of the particular case [126]. the court must make an evaluative judgment whether it would be unconscionable, or unjust, to leave the mistake uncorrected, and form a judgment about the justice of the case [128]. mrs pitt had an incorrect conscious belief, or made an incorrect tacit assumption, that the proposed snt had no adverse tax effects [133]. the snt could have complied with statutory requirements without any artificiality or abuse of statutory relief. it was precisely the sort of trust to which parliament intended to grant relief [134].
