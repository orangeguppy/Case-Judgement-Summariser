a clearly discernible historical trend of increasing the age at which liability for more serious offences is incurred, while reducing the sentence imposed, can be detected [3]. section 4 as originally enacted referred to unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 13 years old. this was amended to 14 years by the children and young persons (northern ireland) act 1950 (the 1950 act). section 5 of the 1885 act created the same offence in relation to a girl between the ages of 13-15. section 5 and section 6 (permitting defilement on premises) contained provisos that it would be a defence to show that the accused reasonably believed the girl was of or above the age of 16 years. such defences were abolished by section 2 of the criminal law (northern ireland) amendment act 1923, as amended by section 140 of the 1950 act. section 5 thus referred to any girl under 17 years old, with an express prohibition of any defence of reasonable belief that she was 17 or older. no such type of defence has ever been explicitly provided in any version of section 4 [7-13]. the constitutional principle that mens rea is presumed to be required in order to establish criminal liability is a strong one. it is not to be displaced in the absence of clear statutory language or unmistakably necessary implication. where the statutory offence is grave and carries a heavy penalty or a substantial social stigma, the case is enhanced against implying that mens rea of any ingredient of the offence is not needed [26]. one must at least begin with an examination of what the legislative intention was before considering whether modification of that intention is justified by later amendments or contemporary social contexts [31]. there can really be no doubt that the section in its original form was intended to impose criminal liability for carnal knowledge of a female under the age of 14 without proof that the perpetrator knew or had reason to believe that she was below that age. the decision in r v prince (1875) lr 2 ccr 154 10 years prior to the 1885 act confirmed that proof of knowledge or lack of reasonable belief in the age of the victim was not required under section 51 of the offences against the person act 1861. this formed the crucial backdrop to the 1885 act. the juxtaposition of sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 act, which originally contained a defence of reasonable belief, with section 4 make it clear that no such defence was to be provided for under the latter section [32]. it would be anomalous if the subsequent removal of the defence from sections 5 and 6 meant that it should be implied into section 4 to which it had not previously applied [34]. while the amended legislation is to be construed in its revised form, it does not follow that its antecedent history has to be entirely left out of account. to suggest that the removal of the defence under sections 5 and 6 would have the effect of introducing it under section 4 by implication takes contrivance too far [36]. the policy approach of protecting younger females by ensuring that a defence of reasonable belief should not be available has been unswerving. further, there is nothing in the contemporary social context which militates against the denial of the defence of belief as to age for section 4 offences [37- 38].
