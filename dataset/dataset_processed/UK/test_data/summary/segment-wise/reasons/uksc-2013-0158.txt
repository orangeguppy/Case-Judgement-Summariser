lord sumption holds that the regulations definition of establishment, which must be read as a whole, envisages a fixed place of business and business activity carried on there consisting in dealings with third parties, and not merely acts of internal administration [13]. for example, disposal of stock in trade would clearly satisfy the definition, but mere internal administration of the winding up including administration of remaining premises in the uk would not [14]. olympic airlines sa was not carrying on business activity at its head office on 20 july 2010 and did not therefore have an establishment in the uk at that date [16]. the requirement of showing at least some subsisting business with third parties is acte clair and so no reference to the court of justice of the european union is necessary [16].
