the court identified four issues of increasing specificity facing the court in this appeal [21]: (1) whether the european convention on human rights (the convention) requires domestic courts to consider the proportionality of evicting a person from his home before making an order for possession; (2) if so, the general implications of this conclusion in practice for claims for possession; (3) the implications of this conclusion on the compatibility of the statutory demoted tenancy regime with the convention; and (4) the application of conclusions (1)-(3) above to the facts of mr pinnocks appeal. in light of the clear and constant line of jurisprudence of the european court of human rights, the court departed from the previous line of the house of lords authorities and concluded that a court, which is asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a persons home, must have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order and, in making that assessment, to resolve any factual disputes between the parties [49], [74]. the court emphasised that this conclusion relates to possession claims by local authorities and is not intended to bear on cases where the person seeking possession is a private landlord, which issue will have to be determined when it arises [50]. the court noted that the appeal involved a comparatively rare type of possession claim, a claim against a demoted tenant. nevertheless, the court was able to make certain general points [61]-[64]: (1) article 8 only comes into play where a persons home is involved; (2) as a general rule, the proportionality of seeking possession will only need to be considered if the point is raised by the occupier concerned; (3) any article 8 defence should initially be considered summarily; (4) even where an outright order for possession is valid under domestic law, article 8 may justify granting an extended period for possession, suspending any possession order or refusing an order altogether; (5) the conclusion that the court must have the ability to consider the article 8 proportionality of making a possession order may require certain statutory and procedural provisions to be revisited; and (6) article 8 proportionality is more likely to be relevant in respect of occupiers who are vulnerable, due to either a mental or a physical disability. the court went on to conclude that it was possible to read and give effect to section 143d(2) in a way that would permit the court to review the proportionality of a landlords decision to seek possession and, if necessary, to make its own assessment of facts in dispute. in particular, he concluded that, by virtue of section 7(1) of the human rights act, county court judges have the necessary jurisdiction to carry out the article 8 proportionality review [77]-[80]. it therefore followed that the demoted tenancy regime is compatible with the convention [104]. given the above conclusions, the court went on to consider whether it was proportionate to evict mr pinnock and his family from the property in light of their article 8 convention rights. having regard to the undisputed evidence of three serious offences committed by mr pinnocks sons in, or in the vicinity of, the property during the year when the demotion order was in force, the court concluded that the possession order against mr pinnock was indeed proportionate and should be upheld [127]-[132].
