whether a justice ministry can be a judicial authority mr bucnys, mr sakalis and mr lavrov submitted that the relevant ministries of justice could not be a judicial authority because they were not part of the courts or judiciary as ordinarily understood. the supreme court, in a judgment given by lord mance with which all other justices agree, holds that member states were not intended to have carte blanche to define judicial authority however they choose. the concept is embedded in european union law. the framework decision is based on article 31(1)(a) of the former treaty of european union, which itself distinguishes between ministries and judicial authorities [23]. the concept falls under eu law to be interpreted by looking at the instruments context and intended effects [45]. in the context of the framework decision, the most obvious purpose of insisting on the concept was to ensure objectivity (including freedom from political or executive influence) in decision-making and to enhance confidence in a system which was going to lead to a new level of mutual cooperation including the surrender of member states own nationals to other member states [45]. an eaw issued by a ministry for a convicted person with a view to his or her surrender can be regarded as issued by a judicial authority if the ministry under the relevant national law issues the warrant at the request of, and by way of endorsement of a decision that the issue of such a warrant is appropriate made by, the court responsible for the sentence or by some other person or body properly regarded as a judicial authority responsible for its execution [66]. if this condition is satisfied, the existence of a discretion on the part of the ministry not to issue a eaw which the responsible court (or other judicial authority) has decided appropriate and requested it to issue does not affect this [66]. that could work only in favour of the person sought by the warrant and would be in the spirit of the framework decision [56]. in issuing the eaws for the arrest of mr bucnys and mr lavrov, the respective ministries acted only at the request of and by way of endorsement of a decision made by a court responsible for the sentence. these two eaws therefore satisfied the above test [66] and are valid. however, in issuing the eaw for mr sakaliss arrest, the lithuanian ministry was acting only on a request from the prison service, and this eaw did not meet the above test and is invalid [67]. the certification of the requests mr bucnys, mr sakalis and mr lavrov also submitted that the terms of section 2(7) of the 2003 act meant that a ministry of justice could be certified by soca only if it was responsible for issuing domestic arrest warrants rather than european ones. while that was not inconsistent with the bare language of the act, such an interpretation would involve soca in onerous investigations of overseas practice and may have perverse results where, for example, the european warrants with which part 1 is concerned were issued by a different, but more senior, judicial authority than the domestic ones [26 28]. the correct interpretation was that section 2(7) referred to the authority responsible for issuing european arrest warrants [33]. the warrants and certification were thus unobjectionable in that respect.
