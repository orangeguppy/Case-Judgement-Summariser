the difficulty with the appellants argument is that the statute says nothing about the potential consequences of failure to use an approved device. this is despite the fact that there are numerous examples of other statutes where such consequences are expressly spelled out, such as in relation to obtaining specimens of breath for road traffic offences [8]. there is a well understood common law rule that evidence which has been obtained unlawfully does not automatically become inadmissible. it is clear that this rule extends equally to evidence created by an unlawful process as it does to existing material uncovered by unlawful process. the common law background to the legislation (article 61 (8b)) shows that inadmissibility of the fingerprints here under consideration cannot possibly simply follow from the existence of the requirement for device approval [9]. it is not correct to say that article 61 (8b) would have no purpose unless fingerprints obtained from unapproved devices were inadmissible at trial. a defendant who was asked to give a fingerprint on an unapproved device could lawfully refuse to do so. while, if such devices were found to be routinely in use by police, there would be no defence to an application for judicial review in which their unlawfulness could be declared and further use prohibited [10]. the appellants relied on the rule that the product of a breathalyser test was inadmissible unless the testing device was an approved one. however, the requirement for approval of fingerprint devices is not analogous to that in cases of breath tests or speed guns. the latter are methods of measuring something that cannot be re-measured, they capture a snapshot of the suspects activity and are often the offence itself i.e. being found to be over the prescribed limit of alcohol at the time of driving. the fingerprints on the other hand could be reproduced at any time afterwards, and would be the same. if the livescan readings were disputed they could readily be independently checked for accuracy and further fingerprints taken by a different method. the ease of which this could be done shows there was no need for parliament to stipulate that the product of unapproved fingerprint readers should be inadmissible. further, no challenge was ever made by the appellants to the accuracy of the fingerprints taken by the livescan device [15]. the background material to the legislation shown to the court further shows that the purpose of the requirement for device approval was not principally the protection of the individual against the risk of conviction on inaccurate evidence [16]. relevant parts of the protection for freedoms act 2012 and criminal justice (northern ireland) act 2013 regarding fingerprints that have yet to come into force further support the construction of the legislation chosen by the supreme court in this case as, where required, express provision is made for evidence to be inadmissible [18].
