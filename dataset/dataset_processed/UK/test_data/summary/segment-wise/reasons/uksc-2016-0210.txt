in deciding which interpretative tools will best assist in ascertaining the meaning of a contract or trust, and the weight to be given to each of the relevant interpretative tools, english courts must have regard to the nature and circumstances of the particular instrument [13]. a pension scheme has several distinctive characteristics which are relevant to the courts selection of the appropriate interpretative tools. first, it is a formal legal document which has been prepared by skilled and specialist legal draftsmen. secondly, unlike many commercial contracts, it is not the product of commercial negotiation between parties who may have conflicting interests and who may conclude their agreement under considerable pressure of time. thirdly, it is an instrument which is designed to operate in the long term, defining peoples rights long after the economic and other circumstances, which existed at the time when it was signed, may have ceased to exist. fourthly, the scheme confers important rights on parties, the members of the pension scheme, who were not parties to the instrument and who may have joined the scheme many years after it was initiated. fifthly, members of a pension scheme may not have easy access to expert legal advice or be able readily to ascertain the circumstances which existed when the scheme was established [14]. in light of these characteristics, it is appropriate for the court to give weight to textual analysis, by concentrating on the words which the draftsman has chosen to use and by attaching less weight to the background factual matrix than might be appropriate in certain commercial contracts [15]. however, the emphasis on textual analysis as an interpretative tool does not derogate from the need both to avoid undue technicality and to have regard to the practical consequences of any construction. such an analysis does not involve literalism but includes a purposive construction when that is appropriate [16]. the court is persuaded that the correct interpretation of the first sentence of the definition is that rpi means the rpi or any index that replaces the rpi and is adopted by the trustees [19]. the court reaches this view for the following eight reasons. first, the draftsman chose to use the word replacement which does not naturally suggest the selection of an alternative to an option which remains available. it is, nonetheless, capable of bearing that meaning, and one must look to the context for guidance [20]. secondly, the word order and grammatical construction of the phrase a replacement adopted by the trustees suggest that the rpi must first be replaced and that the trustees adopt the replacement. [21]. thirdly, the existence of a discretion on the part of the trustees and the requirement that the adoption should not prejudice the approval of the commissioners of inland revenue (cir) do not militate against this view [22]. fourthly, consistency within the rules of the scheme as a whole, and indeed within the definition itself, would suggest that it is the relevant official authority and not the trustees who are to effect the replacement in the first sentence of the definition [23]. fifthly, the cir guidance on approval of schemes does not assist because the draftsman has not chosen to use wording similar to that guidance in the definition [25]. sixthly, the superseded rules do not assist in interpreting the definition [26]. seventhly, a provision which provides for the circumstance of the official replacement of a cost of living index does not lack a rational purpose [27]. eighthly, while the requirement of indexation by reference to the rpi imposes obligations on barnardos and contributes to the pension deficit at a time when many see the cpi as a more reliable index for the cost of living, the court must construe the rules of the scheme without any preconceptions as to whether a construction should favour the sponsoring employer or the members [28].
