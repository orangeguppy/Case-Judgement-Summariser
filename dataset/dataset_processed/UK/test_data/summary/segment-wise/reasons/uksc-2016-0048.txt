under s 40 of the constitutional reform act 2005, appeals to the supreme court are subject to provision under any other enactment restricting such an appeal. the question therefore is whether the provisions of biir constitute such an enactment or otherwise override the jurisdiction granted to the supreme court by s 40 [12]. the application to register a judgment governed by biir is intended to be a speedy and essentially administrative process. either party may appeal the decision under article 33, which is subject to the provision in article 34 that the judgment given on such an appeal may be contested only by the proceedings referred to in the list notified by each member state to the commission pursuant to article 68. the uk has provided in its list of notifications under article 68 that appeals in england and wales under article 34 may be brought only by a single further appeal on a point of law to the court of appeal [16]. it has been the practice of the uk in several previous european instruments concerned with the free movement of judgments and judicial cooperation to provide for only one tier of further appeal. the purpose of this restriction is to further the intention of these instruments that member states should recognise and enforce each others judgments without too many avenues for challenge [26]. the provisions of biir and the notification under article 68 are directly applicable in the uk. article 34 does not depend for its implementation upon the member states choice of avenue of appeal and in any event the uk did make a notification [37]. it is not necessary for the notification to reflect all appellate rights under uk law: to further the objective of biir, article 68 permits member states to make notifications which cut down the routes of appeal which would otherwise be available [38]. it follows that the supreme court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in this case and the appeal is struck out.
