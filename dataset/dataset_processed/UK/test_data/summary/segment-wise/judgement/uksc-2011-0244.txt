the supreme court unanimously dismisses the appeal. there is no general rule that an authority such as the fsa, acting pursuant to a public law duty, should be required to give a cross-undertaking in respect of losses incurred by third parties. further, there are no particular circumstances which mean that the fsa should be required to give such a cross-undertaking on the facts of this case. the judgment of the court is given by lord mance.
