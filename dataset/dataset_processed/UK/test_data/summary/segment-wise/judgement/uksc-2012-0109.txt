the supreme court unanimously dismisses the appeal. the judgment of the court is given by lord toulson, with a concurring judgment by lady hale. mr stott was treated in a humiliating and disgraceful manner by thomas cook. however, his claim falls within the substantive and temporal scope of the convention, and as a result damages cannot be awarded for injury to feelings. substantively, the convention deals comprehensively with the carriers liability for physical incidents involving passengers between embarkation and disembarkation. the fact that mr stotts claim involves an eu law right makes no difference. temporally, mr stotts claim is for damages and distress suffered in the course of embarkation and flight, and these fall squarely within the temporal scope of the convention. it is not enough that the operative causes began prior to boarding.
