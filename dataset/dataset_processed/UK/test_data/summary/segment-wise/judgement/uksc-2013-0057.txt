the supreme court unanimously holds that the common law rule of proportionate recovery established in barker [2006] ukhl 20 continues to apply in guernsey; it accordingly allows zurichs appeal in respect of compensation; but it dismisses the appeal in relation to defence costs [35 and 100]. the judges order is therefore restored. the other issues do not in these circumstances arise, but, because of their general importance, the supreme court states its opinion on them. by a majority of 4-3 the court concludes that, had the position in guernsey been as in the uk under the 2006 act, zurich would have been liable in the first instance to meet iegs claim in respect of the compensation paid by ieg in full, but would have been entitled, in respect of the 21 years not covered by the midland insurance, to claim pro rata contribution from the excess and ieg [96]. lord mance (with whom lords clarke, carnwath and hodge agree) gives the leading majority judgment, and lord sumption (with whom lords neuberger and reed agree) the leading minority judgment. lord hodge gives a separate judgment, as does lord neuberger and lord reed.
