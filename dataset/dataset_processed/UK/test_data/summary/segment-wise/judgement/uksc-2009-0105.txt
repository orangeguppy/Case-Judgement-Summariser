the supreme court has dismissed the appeal by the governing body of jfs. on the direct discrimination issue, the decision was by a majority of five (lord phillips, lady hale, lord mance, lord kerr and lord clarke) to four (lord hope, lord rodger, lord walker and lord brown). the majority held that jfs had directly discriminated against m on grounds of his ethnic origins. lords hope and walker in the minority would have dismissed the appeal on the ground that jfs had indirectly discriminated against m as it had failed to demonstrate that its policy was proportionate. lords rodger and brown would have allowed jfss appeal in its entirety. the supreme court unanimously allowed in part the united synagogues appeal on costs.
