the supreme court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the extradition order of district judge rose. lord sumption gives the judgment of the court. just before this judgment was due to be delivered, the court was informed that mr. zakrzewski had returned voluntarily to poland after the argument on the appeal and been arrested there. accordingly, the warrant has been withdrawn by the court which issued it. this does not affect the issue which the court has to decide. but it does mean that, formally, the appeal must now be dismissed: see section 43(4).
