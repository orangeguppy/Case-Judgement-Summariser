mr and mrs stott decided to take a holiday in zante, greece, in september 2008. mr stott is paralysed from the shoulders down and a permanent wheelchair user. he has double incontinence and uses a catheter. when travelling by air, he depends on his wife to manage his incontinence, help him to eat, and change his sitting position. mr stott booked return flights with thomas cook tour operators ltd (thomas cook), a tour operator and air carrier. he telephoned thomas cooks helpline twice, informing them that he had paid to be seated with his wife, and was assured that this would happen. however, on arrival at check-in for the return journey, mr and mrs stott were told that they would not be seated together. they protested, but were eventually told that the seat allocations could not be changed. mr stott had difficulties in boarding the aircraft, and was not sufficiently assisted by thomas cook staff. he felt extremely embarrassed, humiliated, and angry. he was eventually helped into his seat, with his wife sitting behind him. this arrangement was problematic, since mrs stott could not properly assist her husband during the three hour and twenty minute flight. she had to kneel or crouch in the aisle to attend to his personal needs, obstructing the cabin crew and other passengers. the cabin crew made no attempt to ease their difficulties. mr stott, assisted by the equality and human rights commission, brought a claim under the civil aviation (access to air travel for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility) regulations 2007 (si 2007/1895) (the uk regulations), which implement ec disability rights regulations (the ec regulations). the uk regulations enable civil proceedings in uk courts for breaches of the ec regulations, and state that compensation awarded may include sums for injury to feelings. the ec regulations require community air carriers (among other things) to make reasonable efforts to provide accompanying persons with a seat next to a disabled person. mr stott claimed that thomas cook had breached this duty, and sought a declaration and damages for injury to his feelings. thomas cook argued that it had made reasonable efforts and that the montreal convention (the convention), an international treaty which governs the liability of air carriers in international carriage by air, precluded a damages award for injury to feelings. under articles 17 and 29 of the convention, damages can only be awarded for harm to passengers in cases of death or bodily injury. the judge at trial found that thomas cook had breached the uk regulations, and made a declaration to that effect. however, he held that the convention prevented him from making any damages award to mr stott. the court of appeal agreed. mr stott appealed, arguing that his claim was (i) outside the substantive scope of the convention, since the convention did not touch the issue of equal access to air travel which are governed by the ec regulations and (ii) outside the temporal scope of the convention, since thomas cooks failure to make all reasonable efforts began before mr and mrs stott boarded the aircraft. he relied on eu cases discussing a different eu regulation which required compensation and assistance for passengers in the event of cancellations and delays: the european court had held that this regulation was not incompatible with the convention. the secretary of state for transport intervened to support mr stotts claim on the second (temporal) ground.
