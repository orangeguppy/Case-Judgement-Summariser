this appeal concerns the legality of attempts by the lord chancellor to introduce a residence test for civil legal aid by amending the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders act 2012 (laspo). part 1 of laspo came into force on 1 april 2013. it includes section 9, subsection (1) of which provides that civil legal services are to be available to an individual if they are legal services described in part 1 of schedule 1, and the director of legal aid casework has determined that the individual qualifies for the services in accordance with part 1 of laspo. part 1 of schedule 1 accordingly sets out the services for which civil legal aid is available. subsection 9(2) permits the lord chancellor to (a) add to, and (b) vary or omit services in part 1 of the schedule. in april 2013, the ministry of justice (moj) issued a paper in which it stated that, subject to certain specific exceptions, the government would proceed with the introduction of a residence test so that only those who are lawfully resident in the uk (or crown dependencies or british overseas territories) at the time of the application and have so resided for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any point in the past would be eligible for civil legal aid. in september 2013, the lord chancellor decided to proceed with the proposal and to make regulations to that effect in the form of delegated legislation (the draft order), which was put before parliament on 31 march 2014. before the draft order was laid before parliament, the public law project applied to the high court for a declaration that the draft order was unlawful on the basis that it was (i) ultra vires, i.e. outside the scope of the power granted to the lord chancellor by laspo to bring forward delegated legislation; and (ii) unjustifiably discriminatory in its effect. the divisional court held that the draft order was unlawful on both grounds. following the decision of the divisional court, the lord chancellor withdrew the draft order before any debate in the house of lords could take place. on appeal, the court of appeal allowed the lord chancellors appeal on both grounds, holding that the draft order was intra vires and that, while it was discriminatory in its effect, the discrimination could be justified. the public law project now appeal to the supreme court on both grounds.
