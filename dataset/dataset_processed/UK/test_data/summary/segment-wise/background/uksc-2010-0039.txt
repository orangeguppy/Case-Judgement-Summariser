this appeal concerns the scope of the exceptions to the principle that statements made in the course of without prejudice negotiations are not admissible in evidence (the without prejudice rule). the issue is whether it is permissible to refer to anything written or said in the course of the without prejudice negotiations to help interpret any agreement which results from the negotiations. the appellants, tmt asia limited and others, and the respondent, oceanbulk shipping & trading sa, had entered into a number of forward freight agreements. when the appellants failed to pay a sum due under those agreements, the parties entered into settlement negotiations which were expressed to be without prejudice. the negotiations resulted in a written settlement agreement in respect of the sum due. the respondent brought a claim for damages against the appellants alleging breach of a clause of the settlement agreement. in their defence the appellants sought to rely on statements made during the without prejudice negotiations in support of their interpretation of the clause. the respondent contended that reliance on the statements was precluded by the without prejudice rule. the high court held that the evidence was admissible for the purpose of determining how the terms of the settlement agreement were to be construed notwithstanding the without prejudice rule. the majority of the court of appeal (longmore and stanley burnton ljj), however, allowed oceanbulks appeal, holding that the evidence was not admissible.
