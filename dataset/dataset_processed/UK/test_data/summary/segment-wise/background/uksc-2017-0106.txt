until 1960 cyprus was a colony of the uk. in 1960, pursuant to the cyprus act, the treaty concerning the establishment of the republic of cyprus between the uk, turkey greece and cyprus and an exchange of notes between the uk and cyprus, cyprus became an independent republic. the territory of the new republic was composed of the island of cyprus with the exception of two areas - akrotiri and dhekelia - which were retained under uk sovereignty as sovereign base areas (sbas) for the purposes of accommodating military bases. article 40(1) of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees (1951) (the convention) as modified by the protocol relating to the status of refugees (1967) (the protocol) states that: any state may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare that this convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for the international relations of which it is responsible. on 24 october 1956, prior to cypriot independence, the uk notified the un secretary-general that, subject to certain reservations, the convention would be extended to cyprus. post independence, cyprus notified the secretary-general in 1963 that it had acceded to the convention and in 1968 to the protocol. no notification has ever been made by the uk specifically in relation to the sbas post cypriot independence. the respondents are six refugees. in october 1998 they boarded a ship in lebanon which was bound for italy but which foundered off the coast of cyprus. on 8 october 75 passengers including the respondents were airlifted to safety by raf helicopters and brought to akrotiri in south-western cyprus. in due course they were accepted as lawful refugees under the convention by the sba administration, and permitted to remain. the sba administration sought to persuade the uk government to allow them to resettle in the uk but this was not acceptable to ministers. ever since then they have lived in disused and highly unsatisfactory service accommodation in the sba, while continuing to press for their admission to the uk, on the basis that this is the only practicable way for the uk to discharge its obligations to them under the refugee convention. the arrival of the respondents in the sbas followed by further arrivals in 2000 and 2001 gave rise to arguments between the sbas and cyprus about which of them was to be responsible for the refugees and asylum-seekers among them. these arguments were resolved for future arrivals on 20 february 2003 when the uk and cyprus entered into a memorandum of understanding relating to illegal migrants and asylum seekers (the 2003 memorandum). the agreement provided, in summary, for the full range of governmental services to be provided to refugees by cyprus but at the expense of the uk. shortly after the 2003 memorandum, the sba administrator enacted the refugee ordinance 2003 which gave effect within the sbas to rights substantially corresponding to those conferred by the convention. the 2003 memorandum did not apply to refugees such as the respondents who had arrived in the sbas prior to the date of its conclusion. the appellants case is that in 2005 the cypriot authorities agreed with the sba administration that they would deal with refugees recognised as such by the sba administration in accordance with the 2003 memorandum irrespective of the date of their arrival in the sbas. this agreement, however, has never been reduced to writing. the respondents were unwilling for responsibility for them under the convention to be transferred to the republic, and did not accept that this could lawfully be done without their consent. they continued to press for admission to the uk, latterly with the support of the un high commissioner for refugees (unhcr). the unhappy course of the ensuing dispute is summarised in the judgment. it came to a head when in 2013, the respondents formally asked to be admitted to the uk. in a decision dated 25 november 2014, the secretary of state refused entry. the respondents challenged that decision on the basis that it was inconsistent with the convention. the high court held that the convention did not extend to the sbas as a matter of international law, but quashed the secretary of states decision on the basis that she had failed to take into account concerns raised by the unhcr. the court of appeal overturned that decision, declared that the convention did extend to the sbas and directed the secretary of state to make a fresh decision on whether to admit the respondents to the uk, having regard to the uks obligations under the convention. on 6 july 2017, the secretary of state made a fresh decision refusing to admit the respondents on the basis that she considered that they could resettle in the cyprus or, alternatively that the uk could comply with its obligations by arranging for the respondents to be supported by cyprus as agreed in 2005. the broad question at issue in the appeal is whether the respondents are entitled or should be permitted to be resettled in the uk on the basis of the convention or that in the exceptional circumstances of the case the secretary of state should exercise his discretion to admit them. the specific issues identified by the court as essential to the resolution of the appeal are as follows [60]: (i) does the convention (as extended by the 1967 protocol) apply to the sbas? (ii) does the convention by its terms entitle the respondents to be resettled in the uk? (iii) was the memorandum of understanding of 2003 a valid performance of the convention obligations for those within its scope? in particular: a. was the uk in principle entitled to fulfil its obligations under the convention by arranging for support to be provided by cyprus? b. if so, were the terms of the memorandum of understanding (including the 2003 refugee ordinance) a proper basis on which to do so? a. was the uk entitled in 2005 to make the same arrangements in respect of the respondents without their consent given their lawful and accepted presence as refugees in the sbas since 2000 (it being accepted that the respondents are entitled to continue to live in the sbas [107])? b. if so, was the 2005 agreement with cyprus a legally effective means of doing so, having regard to its informality and the absence of incorporation into sba law? c. has the support of cyprus for the respondents in accordance with the 2005 agreement been available in practice, and can it be assured in the future? (v) if the 2005 agreement, for whatever reason, was not a legally effective means of discharging the uks obligations to the respondents under the convention, or if such support has not been available in practice, what are the consequences, in terms of rights or remedies potentially available in these proceedings, and how should the court give effect to them in its order? (iv) if the answer to (iii) is yes:
