the appellants in these cases challenged the validity of an amendment to the immigration rules in 2010 requiring a foreign spouse or partner of a british citizen or person settled in the united kingdom to pass a test of competence in the english language before coming to live here (rule e-ecp 4.1 and e-ltrp 4.1 in appendix fm) (the rule). they argued that the rule itself is an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private and family life protected by article 8 of the european convention on human rights (echr) and/or is unjustifiably discriminatory in securing the enjoyment that right contrary to article 14, or unlawful by reason of its irrationality. the governments objectives in introducing the pre-entry english requirement for spouses and partners were (a) to assist the spouse or partners integration into british society at an early stage, (b) to improve employment chances for those who have access to the labour market, (c) to raise awareness of the importance of language and to prepare for the tests that the spouses or partners would later have to pass to settle indefinitely in the uk, (d) to save translation costs, (e) to benefit any children the couple might have and (f) to reduce the vulnerability of newly arrived spouses, especially women. the rule requires spouses and partners to show the ability to speak english at a basic level by passing a test with an approved test provider unless exceptional circumstances are shown. guidance accompanying the rule makes it clear that exceptional circumstances will rarely arise and do not include financial reasons or lack of literacy. the appellants are uk citizens who have been married to foreigners since 2009 and 2010 respectively. their husbands are unable to satisfy the pre-entry language requirement, in saiqa bibis case because he would have to relocate to rawalpindi in pakistan for several months, which is not affordable, and in mrs alis case because there is no test centre in the yemen where they have had to live. the high court held that the rule itself was not unlawful. the court of appeal by a majority upheld the high courts decision.
