the respondent, mrs cox, worked as the catering manager at hm prison swansea. she was in charge of all aspects of the catering, including the operation of the kitchen producing meals for prisoners. she supervised prisoners who worked in the kitchen alongside other civilian catering staff. on 10 september 2007 mrs cox instructed some prisoners to take some kitchen supplies to the kitchen stores. during the course of this operation, one of the prisoners, mr inder, accidentally dropped a sack of rice onto mrs coxs back, injuring her. mrs cox brought a claim against the ministry of justice (moj) in the swansea county court. his honour judge keyser qc found that mr inder was negligent, but dismissed the claim on the basis that the prison service, which is an executive agency of the ministry of justice, was not vicariously liable as the relationship between the prison service and mr inder was not akin to that between an employer and an employee. the court of appeal reversed the decision, finding that the prison service was vicariously liable for mr inders negligence. the question on the mojs appeal to the supreme court concerns the sort of relationship which has to exist between an individual and a defendant before the defendant can be made vicariously liable in tort for the conduct of that individual. this case was heard alongside mohamud v wm morrison supermarkets plc [2016] uksc 11 which addresses the question of how the conduct of the individual has to be related to that relationship, in order for vicarious liability to be imposed on the defendant.
