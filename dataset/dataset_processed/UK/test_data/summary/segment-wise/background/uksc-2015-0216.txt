the children and young people (scotland) act 2014 (the 2014 act) makes provision for a named person service (the nps) in relation to children and young people (c&yp) in scotland. the nps establishes the new professional role of the named person, and envisages that all c&yp in scotland will be assigned a named person. the nps aims to achieve two policy aims: first, a shift away from intervention by public authorities after a risk to welfare has been identified, to an emphasis on early intervention to promote wellbeing. secondly, moving from a legal structure under which the duties of statutory bodies to cooperate were linked to the performance of their individual functions, to one which ensures that they work collaboratively and share information in order to support wellbeing. the 2014 act is supplemented by revised statutory guidance (the guidance), which is still in draft. part 4 of the 2014 act (part 4) provides that named persons will exercise certain functions in relation to c&yp. these include: (a) advising, informing or supporting them or their parents; (b) helping them or their parents access a service or support; and (c) discussing or raising a matter about them with a service provider (e.g. health boards and local authorities) or relevant authority (e.g. the nhs and scottish police authority). the authority responsible for the provision of the nps (the nps provider) changes depending on the age and circumstances of the child or young person. part 4 also sets out powers and duties relating to information sharing, including (in s.23) conditions for when information must be shared following a change in nps provider, and (in s.26) conditions for when information must be shared between service providers or relevant authorities, and the nps provider. section 26(8) includes an additional power of disclosure where the nps provider holds information and it considers that providing it to a service provider or relevant authority is necessary or expedient (s.26(9)) for the purpose of the exercise of any of the named person functions. the powers and duties of disclosure under ss.23 and 26 cannot, however, be exercised where the information would be provided in breach of a prohibition or restriction under an enactment. the appellants are four registered charities with an interest in family matters, and three individual parents. they challenged part 4 by way of judicial review on the basis that it is outside the legislative competence of the scottish parliament under the scotland act 1998 (the scotland act) because: (a) it relates to matters which are reserved under the scotland act to the uk parliament (the reserved matters challenge); (b) it is incompatible with rights under the european convention on human rights (the echr challenge); and/or (c) it is incompatible with eu law (the eu law challenge). the appellants challenges were dismissed in both the outer house and the inner house of the court of session. they now appeal to the supreme court.
