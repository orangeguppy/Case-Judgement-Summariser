farstad supply as (farstad) owned an oil rig supply vessel which was damaged by fire while berthed in harbour on 7 july 2002. at the time of the fire, the third party charterer, asco uk limited (asco), had engaged the defender, enviroco limited (enviroco), to clean out tanks on board the vessel. following the fire, farstad sued enviroco for damages, alleging that the fire was caused by the negligence of envirocos employees. enviroco, as well as alleging contributory negligence against farstads employees, sought a contribution from asco under section 3(2) of the law reform (miscellaneous provisions) (scotland) act 1940 (the 1940 act). section 3 of the 1940 act is entitled contribution among joint wrongdoers. section 3(1) deals with the case where the party suing (farstad) proceeds against two defenders in respect of loss or damage caused by both and a judgment is given against both, so that both are found jointly and severally liable in damages. subsection (2) provides that a defender who has been held liable and pays damages to the suing party under subsection (1), has a right to recover such contribution as the court deems just from any other person who, if sued, might also have been held liable in respect of the loss or damage on which the action was founded. by clause 33(5) of the charterparty, farstad agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless asco from all liabilities resulting from damage to the vessel. if therefore enviroco was entitled to a contribution from asco under section 3(2) it was agreed that asco would (at the least) be entitled to an indemnity from farstad under clause 33(5). whatever the result therefore, asco would not ultimately be liable. in the outer house, court of session, the lord ordinary held that enviroco was not entitled to a contribution from asco under section 3(2) of the 1940 act. an extra division of the inner house, court of session, allowed envirocos subsequent reclaiming motion by a majority of 2:1. farstad appealed to the supreme court to restore the decision of the lord ordinary. the three agreed issues to be decided on appeal were: 1) the meaning and effect of section 3(2) of the 1940 act; 2) whether a defence provided by a pre-existing contract (such as the charterparty) can be taken into account in determining whether a person if sued, might also have been held liable for the purposes of section 3(2); and 3) if the answer to (2) is yes, whether clause 33(5) of the charterparty has the effect that asco is not a person who, if sued, might have also been held liable to farstad for the purposes of section 3(2).
