this appeal concerns the lawfulness of the airports national policy statement (the anps) and its accompanying environmental report. the anps is the national policy framework which governs the construction of a third runway at heathrow airport. any future application for development consent to build this runway will be considered against the policy framework in the anps. the anps does not grant development consent in its own right. successive governments have considered whether there is a need for increased airport capacity in the south east of england. the secretary of state for transport (the secretary of state) declared that the government accepted the case for airport expansion in 2015. he announced that the north west runway (nwr) scheme was the preferred scheme in october 2016. the uk was separately developing its policy on environmental issues and climate change. on 22 april 2016 the uk signed the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change (the paris agreement). the uk ratified the agreement on 17 november 2016. the agreement sets out various targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, and the reduction of temperature increases resulting from global warming (the paris agreement targets). two government ministers andrea leadsom mp and amber rudd mp made statements about the governments approach to the paris agreement in march 2016. against this background, the secretary of state designated the anps as national policy on 26 june 2018. objectors to the nwr scheme, including friends of the earth ltd (foe) and plan b earth, challenged the lawfulness of the secretary of states designation on a number of grounds. the divisional court dismissed all of the objectors various claims in two separate judgments. the court of appeal upheld the main parts of these judgments on appeal but allowed some of foe and plan b earths grounds. it held the secretary of state had acted unlawfully in failing to take the paris agreement into account when designating the anps. accordingly, the anps was of no legal effect. the secretary of state does not appeal the court of appeals decision. however, the company which owns heathrow airport, heathrow airport ltd (hal), is a party to the proceedings and has been granted permission to appeal to the supreme court. hal has stated that it has already invested a large sum of money in promoting the nwr scheme and wishes to make an application for development consent to carry the project through.
