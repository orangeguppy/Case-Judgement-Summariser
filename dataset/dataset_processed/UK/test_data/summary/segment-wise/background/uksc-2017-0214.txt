tadalafil is the generic name for a drug which is sold under the brand name cialis for the treatment of, among other things, erectile dysfunction (ed). tadalafil is a competitor (second in class) to sildenafil, which was and is sold under the brand name, viagra. the patent which is the subject of this appeal is ep(uk) 1,173,181 (the 181 patent). it is owned by icos and exclusively licensed to eli lilly (collectively lilly). it was filed on 26 april 2000 and granted on 15 october 2003. the 181 patent relates to the use of tadalafil in a dosage form for the treatment of ed. this case is concerned with section 3 of the patents act 1977 (1977 act): section 2(2) of the 1977 act provides: an invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter which forms part of the state of the art by virtue only of section 2(2) above (and disregarding section 2(3) above). the state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything else) which has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available to the public (whether in the united kingdom or elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use or in any other way. these statutory provisions mandate the court to assess whether an invention is obvious by having regard to the state of the art at the priority date of the invention. if the invention is not obvious to the skilled person at that date, section 3 deems the invention to involve an inventive step. lilly asserts that the essence of the invention is the discovery that tadalafil is effective in treating ed at a low dose and with minimal side effects. this discovery has allowed the drug to be taken daily (for chronic use) rather than on demand, avoiding the need to anticipate when sexual activity might occur. this is, lilly claims, a significant technical advantage as sildenafil is approved for on-demand use only. the respondents raised proceedings to revoke the 181 patent. lilly defended the claim and counterclaimed that the respondents were threatening to infringe its patent. the high court held that a 5mg daily dose of tadalafil was not obvious as a treatment for ed and therefore concluded that the 181 patent involves an inventive step. the court of appeal allowed the appeal on the ground that the 181 patent lacked inventive step. lilly appealed to the supreme court.
