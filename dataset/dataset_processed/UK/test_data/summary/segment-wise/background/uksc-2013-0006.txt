on 6 december 2010 the crown prosecution service applied to the crown court for restraint orders under section 41 of the proceeds of crime act 2002 (poca) against two individuals, and restraint and receivership orders (under s. 48 poca) against eastenders group. eastenders group, of which the individuals were the joint owners, was a holding company for a number of trading cash and carry retail outlets. these orders were sought because the cps was conducting a covert investigation into a suspected fraud on hmrc, allegedly carried out through eastenders group companies. a poca restraint order prevents named persons from dealing with their own assets until the order is discharged. a receivership order appoints a receiver to manage the assets of the company subject to the restraint order. the cps sought to have mr barnes, a partner in a well-known firm of accountants, appointed as eastenders groups receiver under a letter of agreement between the cps and mr barnes. the letter of agreement suggested that mr barnes would be remunerated from eastenders group property. the restraint and receivership orders were made by the crown court judge after a short hearing. mr barnes was appointed and began to manage the group. on 23 december 2010, the eastenders group sought to have its orders discharged, but the judge refused. the group appealed to the court of appeal, heard on 25 january 2011. on 26 january 2011 the court of appeal quashed the orders over the group. they held that the orders should never have been made: there was no good arguable case that the group assets should be regarded as the individuals assets, and 95% of the business of the group was demonstrably legitimate. however, during the period of the receivership, the receiver had incurred costs and expenses of 772,547. this included significant sums for site security, legal expenses and the receivers fees. the receiver applied to the crown court for permission to draw his remuneration and expenses from eastenders group assets. the application was refused by underhill j, who held that requiring the companies to pay would breach the groups right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions under article 1 of protocol 1 to the european convention on human rights (a1p1), and so would be unlawful under s. 6 human rights act 1998 (s. 3 hra 1998). he went on to hold that it was possible to interpret poca (by s. 3 hra 1998) to give the court the power to require the cps to pay the receivers remuneration and expenses. the cps appealed to the court of appeal. the majority of the court of appeal upheld underhill js decision that the groups rights under a1p1 would be infringed by an order entitling the receiver to draw his remuneration from its assets on the basis that the order was insufficiently foreseeable. laws lj, dissenting on that point, would have allowed the receiver to draw his remuneration from eastenders assets. the court was unanimous that there was no basis under poca or the hra 1998 for the cps to be required to pay the receivers remuneration and expenses. the receiver appealed to the supreme court.
