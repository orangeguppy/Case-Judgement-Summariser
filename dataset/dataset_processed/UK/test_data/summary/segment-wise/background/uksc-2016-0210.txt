there is a recognised need for private pension schemes to provide some form of indexation of pensions to protect the value of members pensions against price inflation. to this end, barnardos adopted a pension scheme which provides for pensions in the course of payment to be increased by the prescribed rate, which is defined as an increase at the rate of the lesser of:- (a) 5%, and (b) the percentage rise in the retail prices index (if any) over the year ending on the previous 31 december. the definition of retail prices index lies at the heart of the dispute: retail prices index means the general index of retail prices published by the department of employment or any replacement adopted by the trustees without prejudicing approval. where an amount is to be increased in line with the retail prices index over a period, the increase as a percentage of the original amount will be equal to the percentage increase between the figures in the retail prices index published immediately prior to dates when the period began and ended, with an appropriate restatement of the later figure if the retail prices index has been replaced or re-based during the period (the definition). the critical clause in the definition is or any replacement adopted by the trustees without prejudicing approval. barnardos argues that this clause empowers the trustees to adopt another index which they consider a more suitable measure of price inflation (such as the consumer prices index (the cpi)), regardless of whether or not the retail price index (rpi) continues to be published. representatives of members of the scheme, who are concerned that the adoption of the cpi as the index would over time reduce benefits which they receive from the scheme, argue that the clause does not empower the trustees to depart from the rpi for the purposes of the indexation if the rpi continues to be published. the trustees adopt a neutral stance. the trustees sought a ruling on the meaning of the definition. the high court held that, on a proper construction, the definition did not empower the trustees to adopt an index other than the rpi unless the rpi had been discontinued as an officially published index and replaced. barnardos appealed this decision. the court of appeal by majority (lewison and mcfarlane llj, vos lj dissenting) dismissed the appeal. barnardos appealed to the supreme court.
