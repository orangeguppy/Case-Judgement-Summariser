on 9 september 2004 the appellant, steve allison, was convicted after trial in the high court at glasgow of four contraventions of section 4(3)(b) of the misuse of drugs act 1971. in effect, he was found guilty of being concerned in the supplying of cocaine and three other controlled drugs. the trial judge sentenced him to 8 years imprisonment. the appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. on 7 november 2008 the appeal court (lord osborne, lady paton and lord philip) refused his appeal against conviction, leaving his appeal against sentence to be heard on a date to be fixed. one of his grounds of appeal, which was first advanced in an additional note of appeal, related to the record of a police interview of a john stronach. mr stronach had died before the trial and the crown introduced the interview into evidence in accordance with the procedure in section 259(5) of the criminal procedure (scotland) act 1995. neither before nor during the trial did the crown disclose to the defence that mr stronach had a number of previous convictions and that there were outstanding charges against him. one of the outstanding cases was under the misuse of drugs act and related to events covered by the trial and it was therefore known to the appellants legal advisers. the crown disclosed the previous convictions and the other outstanding charges only while the appellants appeal was pending before the appeal court. this prompted the appellant to argue that the crowns failure to disclose to the defence the existence of all the previous convictions and outstanding charges was incompatible with his article 6 convention rights. as a result, the defence had been unable to prepare and conduct their defence properly and appellant did not receive a fair trial. when dismissing the appellants appeal, the appeal court accepted that the failure by the crown to disclose mr stronachs previous convictions had been incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) rights. having considered the circumstances of the case, however, the appeal court was not persuaded that the crowns failure had resulted in an unfair trial and hence a miscarriage of justice. the appeal court drew a distinction between mr stronachs previous convictions and the outstanding charges against him. because of the presumption of innocence, the appeal court did not consider that the existence of outstanding charges could be of importance in connection with the preparation of a defence or with any challenge that might be mounted to the credibility of a witness.
