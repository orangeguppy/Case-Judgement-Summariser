these proceedings concern a child, called dd in the judgment, who was born in 2006 in romania, to romanian parents who met while working in england. the family returned to england after the birth. the parents separated in 2007 and dd has lived in england since then in the care of his mother. the father returned to romania in 2009 but has maintained a significant relationship with his son. he commenced divorce and custody proceedings in romania in 2007 which, after long delays, culminated in a decision of the bucharest court of appeal in november 2013 that dd should live with his father. the father applied for the recognition and enforcement of this custody order by the english court in february 2014. these proceedings are governed by the brussels ii (revised) regulation (biir). dd was made a party. in july 2014 a high court judge refused the fathers application, applying article 23(b) biir which provides that a judgment should not be recognised if it was given, except in a case of urgency, without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the member state in which recognition was sought. the romanian court had not made direct or indirect enquiry of dd regarding his wishes and feelings. the court of appeal upheld the judges order. the father sought to pursue a further appeal to the supreme court. the supreme court considered as a preliminary issue whether it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against an order for the enforcement of a custody order in proceedings governed by biir.
