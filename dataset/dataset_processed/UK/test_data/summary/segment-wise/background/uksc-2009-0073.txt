the appellants were convicted of serious criminal offences after trials in which the victims of the offences did not give evidence: in one case because he had since died and in the other because she had run away in fear when the trial was about to commence. in each case a statement from the victim was admitted pursuant to s 116 criminal justice act 2003 and placed before the jury. the appellants complained that their convictions were based solely or to a decisive extent on the statement of a witness whom they had had no chance to cross-examine. this had infringed their right to a fair trial guaranteed by articles 6(1) and 6(3) of the european convention on human rights which provide: 6(1) in the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law (3) everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: (d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of the court of appeal had dismissed the appellants appeals against conviction, holding that the test of fairness laid down by the european court of human rights in al-khawaja and tahery v united kingdom (2009) 49 ehrr 1 was not determinative of the results in these appeals. the united kingdom had requested that this decision be referred to the grand chamber of the strasbourg court. on 5 june 2009 the panel of the grand chamber adjourned consideration of that request pending the judgement of the supreme court in this case.
