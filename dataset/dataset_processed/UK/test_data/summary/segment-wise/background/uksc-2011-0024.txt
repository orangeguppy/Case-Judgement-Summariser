the issue is whether the ban on the entry for settlement of foreign spouses or civil partners unless both parties are aged 21 or over, contained in paragraph 277 of the immigration rules, was a lawful way of deterring or preventing forced marriages. paragraph 277 of the immigration rules [paragraph 277] was amended with effect from 27 november 2008 to raise the minimum age for a person either to be granted a visa for the purposes of settling in the united kingdom as a spouse or to sponsor another for the purposes of obtaining such a visa from 18 to 21. the purpose of the amendment was not to control immigration but to deter forced marriages. a forced marriage is a marriage into which at least one party enters without her or his free and full consent through force or duress, including coercion by threats or other psychological means. mr quila, a chilean national, entered into a fully consensual marriage with ms jeffery, a british citizen. mr aguilar quila applied for a marriage visa before the amendment took effect, but his application was refused as his wife was only 17 and a sponsoring spouse had to be 18. by the time that ms jeffrey had turned 18 the amendment was in force and the home office refused to waive it. consequently, mr quila and his wife were forced to leave the uk initially to live in chile (his wife having had to relinquish a place to study languages at royal holloway, university of london) and subsequently to live in ireland. bibi (as she invited the court to describe her) is a pakistani national who applied to join her husband, mohammed, a british citizen, in the uk. bibi and mohammed had an arranged marriage in pakistan in october 2008, to which each of them freely consented. their application was refused as both parties were under 21. the respondents claims for judicial review of the decisions were both rejected in the high court. the respondents successfully appealed to the court of appeal, which declared that the application of paragraph 277 so as to refuse them marriage visas was in breach of their rights under article 8 of the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms 1950 [the echr]. the secretary of state has appealed to the supreme court.
