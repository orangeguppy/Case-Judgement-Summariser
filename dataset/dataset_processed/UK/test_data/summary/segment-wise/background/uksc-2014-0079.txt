the benefit cap was introduced in the welfare reform act 2012 and implemented by the benefit cap (housing benefit) regulations 2012 (the regulations). the main issue in this appeal is whether the regulations are unlawful under the human rights act 1998. it is argued that the cap has an unjustifiably discriminatory impact on women in relation to their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, contrary to article 14 of the european convention on human rights taken with article 1 of the first protocol to the echr (a1p1). the cap applies where the total entitlement of a single person or couple to specified welfare benefits exceeds an amount which represents the average weekly earnings of a working household in great britain, net of tax and national insurance contributions. the regulations fix the cap at 350 a week for a single claimant without dependent children, and 500 for all other claimants. benefits taken into account include housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit. the governments justification for the scheme is that it is necessary (i) to set a reasonable limit on the extent to which the state will support non-working families from public funds; (ii) provide members of households of working age with a greater incentive to work and (iii) achieve savings in public expenditure. the cap does not apply to persons or families entitled to working tax credit. receipt of this benefit requires a lone parent responsible for a child to work at least 16 hours a week, and a couple with a child to work a total of 24 hours a week, with one of them working at least 16 hours. the cap affects a higher number of women than men. that is because the majority of non-working households receiving the highest levels of benefits are single parent households, and most single parents are women. the appellants are two lone mothers and their youngest children. the application of the cap reduced sgs weekly income from the specified benefits by 75, and nss by 55. the courts below held that the indirectly discriminatory impact of the scheme upon lone parents, and therefore women, could be justified and that the scheme was therefore lawful.
