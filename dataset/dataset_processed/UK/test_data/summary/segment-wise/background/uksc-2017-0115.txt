on 26 may 2013, the respondent, ms bianca cameron, was injured when her car collided with a nissan micra. it is not in dispute that the incident was due to the negligence of the driver of the micra. the registration number of the micra was recorded, but the driver made off without stopping or reporting the accident to the police and has not been heard of since. mr naveed hussain, the registered keeper, was not the driver and has declined to identify the driver. he has been convicted of failing to disclose the drivers identity. the car was insured under a policy issued by the appellant, liverpool victoria insurance co ltd, to a mr nissar bahadur, whom the company believes to be a fictitious person. neither mr hussain nor the driver was insured under the policy to drive the car. ms cameron initially sued mr hussain for damages. the proceedings were amended to add a claim against liverpool victoria insurance for a declaration that it would be liable to meet any judgment against him. the insurer served a defence, denying liability on the ground that there was no right to obtain a judgment against him as there was no evidence that he was the driver. ms cameron then applied to amend her claim form and particulars of claim. she sought to substitute for mr hussain, as defendant, the person unknown driving vehicle registration number y598 sps who collided with vehicle registration number kg03 zjz on 26 may 2013. district judge wright dismissed that application and entered summary judgment for the insurer. hhj parker dismissed ms camerons appeal. on further appeal, the court of appeal allowed the appeal by a majority (gloster and lloyd jones ljj, sir ross cranston dissenting). the majority considered that the court had a discretion to permit an unknown person to be sued whenever justice required it and that an alternative right of claim against the motor insurance bureau (mib) was irrelevant. sir ross cranston would have dismissed the appeal in light of the alternative right to an mib claim. liverpool victoria insurance appealed to the supreme court in relation to two issues: (1) the power to issue or amend the claim form and (2) the compatibility of the road traffic act 1988 (the 1988 act) with the sixth motor insurance directive (2009/103/ec).
