on 20 december 2010, the financial services authority (fsa), acting in pursuance of its public duties under sections 3 to 6 of the financial services and markets act 2000 (fsma), made a without notice application for a freezing injunction against sinaloa gold and ph capital invest under section 380(3) of fsma. the fsa alleged that both companies were involved in promoting the sale of shares in sinaloa without proper authorisation and an approved prospectus and that ph capital invest had breached fsma in various other respects. schedule b to the injunction stated that the fsa gave no cross-undertaking in damages. however, under schedule b, the fsa undertook to cover both costs and losses incurred by third parties as a result of the injunction. the undertaking in respect of third party losses was inadvertent and the fsa applied to have it removed. barclays - with whom sinaloa gold plc had six bank accounts - intervened to oppose this application. the application to have the undertaking removed was refused in the high court. however, this decision was reversed in the court of appeal. the effect of the court of appeals decision was to preserve the undertaking in respect of third party costs but eliminate the undertaking in respect of third party losses. barclays appealed to the supreme court.
