ms rhuppiah, a tanzanian national, entered the uk in 1997 with leave to reside here as a student for three months. the home secretary granted further leave to her to reside in the uk as a student on 12 occasions, but some of these applications for leave were made after the previous leave had expired. while they were studying at the same college, ms rhuppiah met ms charles, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, a gravely debilitating condition. they have resided together since 2001. ms rhuppiah cooks food suitable for ms charless medical condition and accompanies her to bristol, to hospital and in effect everywhere. instead of paying her for looking after her in these respects, ms charles provides her with largely free board and lodging. ms rhuppiah, a seventh day adventist, cares for ms charles out of friendship, faith and habit. were ms rhuppiah to leave the uk, ms charless health would be compromised, her life turned upside down, and she would have to turn to the state for care. after her final grant of leave expired in november 2009, ms rhuppiah twice failed to secure indefinite leave to remain in the uk, first because her residence here over the past ten years had not always been lawful, and second because she applied on the wrong form and by the time she reapplied the immigration rules, hc395 (the rules) had changed, fatally for her reapplication. the home secretary was then obliged to determine whether her reapplication could nevertheless succeed outside the rules, on the basis of her right to respect for the private life she had established in the uk, including her friendship with ms charles, under article 8 of the european convention on human rights. the home secretarys determination on this basis was also negative. ms rhuppiah challenged the home secretarys decision at the first-tier tribunal (ftt). under section 117b(5) of the nationality, immigration and asylum act 2002 (the 2002 act), little weight should be given to an applicants private life if it was established in the uk at a time when his or her immigration status was precarious. the ftt dismissed ms rhuppiahs challenge on the basis that this provision applied to her; and that, besides, she was not financially independent (another consideration, which section 117b(3) of the 2002 act required the home secretary to weigh against her right to respect for her private life) as she depended on support from her father and from ms charles. ms rhuppiah appealed unsuccessfully to the upper tribunal and the court of appeal. her appeal has now become academic, because she has now lived continuously in the uk for long enough to secure leave to remain by a different route. the supreme court nevertheless heard the appeal, because of the public importance of providing a definitive interpretation of the word precarious in section 117b(5).
