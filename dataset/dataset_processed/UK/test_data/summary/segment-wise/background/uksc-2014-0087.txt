on 15 march 2008 the claimant entered the respondents premises in small heath, birmingham which include a petrol station and a kiosk where customers pay for their purchases. having parked his car he entered the kiosk to ask whether he could print some documents from a usb stick. mr amjid khan was behind the kiosk desk, employed by the respondent to see that petrol pumps and the kiosk were kept in good order and to serve customers. mr khan refused the claimants request in a rude manner, at which the claimant protested. mr khan responded in foul, racist and threatening language and ordered the claimant to leave. the claimant returned to his car followed by mr khan. before the claimant could drive off, mr khan opened the passenger door, told the claimant in threatening words never to return and punched him on the left temple. the claimant got out and walked round to close the passenger door when mr khan subjected him to a serious attack. the claimant had not done anything which could be considered aggressive or abusive. the claimant brought proceedings against the respondent on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the actions of its employee mr khan. the trial judge dismissed the claim because he considered that there was an insufficiently close connection between what mr khan was employed to do and his tortious conduct in attacking the claimant for the respondent to be liable. the court of appeal upheld the judges decision. the claimant appealed, challenging whether the close connection test was the appropriate standard to apply and also arguing that his claim should have succeeded in any event.
