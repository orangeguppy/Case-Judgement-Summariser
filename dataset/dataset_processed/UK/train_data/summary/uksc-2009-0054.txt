the supreme court unanimously allows the appeal, holding that the reasonable tolerability test applied by the court of appeal is contrary to the convention and should not be followed in the future.
hj and hts cases are remitted for reconsideration in light of the detailed guidance provided by the supreme court.
there is no dispute that homosexuals are protected by the convention, membership of the relevant social group being defined by the immutable characteristic of its members sexuality [paras [6] and [10] per lord hope and para [42] per lord rodger].
to compel a homosexual person to pretend that their sexuality does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny him his fundamental right to be who he is.
homosexuals are as much entitled to freedom of association with others of the same sexual orientation, and to freedom of self expression in matters that affect their sexuality, as people who are straight [paras [11] and [14] per lord hope and para [78] per lord rodger].
the convention confers the right to asylum in order to prevent an individual suffering persecution, which has been interpreted to mean treatment such as death, torture or imprisonment.
persecution must be either sponsored or condoned by the home country in order to implicate the convention [paras [12] and [13] per lord hope].
simple discriminatory treatment on grounds of sexual orientation does not give rise to protection under the convention.
nor does the risk of family or societal disapproval, even trenchantly expressed [paras [13], [15] and [22] per lord hope and para [61] per lord rodger].
one of the fundamental purposes of the convention was to counteract discrimination and the convention does not permit, or indeed envisage, applicants being returned to their home country on condition that they take steps to avoid offending their persecutors.
persecution does not cease to be persecution for the purposes of the convention because those persecuted can eliminate the harm by taking avoiding action [paras [14] and [26] per lord hope and paras [52] [53] and [65] per lord rodger].
the reasonable tolerability test applied by the court of appeal must accordingly be rejected [para [29] per lord hope and paras [50], [75] and [81] per lord rodger].
there may be cases where the fear of persecution is not the only reason that an applicant would hide his sexual orientation, for instance, he may also be concerned about the adverse reaction of family, friends or colleagues.
in such cases, the applicant will be entitled to protection if the fear of persecution can be said to be a material reason for the concealment [paras [62], [67] and [82] per lord rodger].
lord rodger (with whom lords walker and collins and sir john dyson scj expressly agreed), at para [82] and lord hope, at para [35], provided detailed guidance in respect of the test to be applied by the lower tribunals and courts in determining claims for asylum protection based on sexual orientation.
