the madras legislature enacted the madras commercial crops markets act for providing satisfactory conditions for the growers of commercial crops to sell their produce on equal terms with the purchasers and at reasonable prices.
the act, rules and the bye laws framed thereunder have a long term target of providing a net work of markets wherein facilities for correct weighment are ensured, storage accommodation is provided, and reliable market information is given.
till such markets are established the act provides for the imposition of licensing restrictions to enable the buyers and sellers to meet in licensed premises.
after the establishment of the markets no licenses would be issued within a reasonable radius from the markets and all growers will have to resort to the markets for selling their crops.
the result would be to eliminate, as far as possible, the middlemen and to give reasonable facilities for the growers of commercial crops to secure best prices for their commodities.
held, that the impugned provisions of the act impose reasonable restrictions on the citizen 's right to do business and are valid.
such a statute cannot be said to create unreasonable restrictions on the citizen 's right to do business unless it is clearly established that the provisions are too drastic, unnecessarily harsh and over reach the object for which they were made.
