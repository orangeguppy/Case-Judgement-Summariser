appellant was detained under section 3(1)(a)(i) of the preventive detention act, act iv of 1950 on the grounds that with the financial help given by the portuguese authorities he was carrying on espionage on their behalf with the help of underground workers and that he was also collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and was making such intelligence available to the portuguese authorities.
appellant made no application to the government for further particulars.
held, that in these circumstances and having regard to the fact that what is alleged is espionage activity, the grounds could not be considered to be vague.
in answer to the objection in the writ application before the high court that the grounds were not specific and that no particular of the alleged activities of the appellant were given the under secretary to the government in his affidavit claimed privilege under article 22(6) of the constitution.
held, that the right of the detenue to be furnished particulars is subject to the limitation under article 22(6).
hence even if the grounds are vague due to the reason that facts cannot be disclosed in the public interest, the order of detention cannot be challenged on the ground of such vagueness.
the necessity of communicating the decision to claim privilege under article 22(6) would arise only when the detenue asks for parti 383 culars.
in the absence of any such request by the detenue, the noncommunication of the decision cannot be hold to have hampered his constitutional right to make his representation.
mala fides must be made out against the detaining authority and not against the police.
the contention of mala fides is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the grounds and to the nature of the activities imputed to the appellant.
