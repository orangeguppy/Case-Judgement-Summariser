the appellant was tried for murder.
the facts established were that there were quarrels between the appellant and the deceased over the purchase of a cycle and in a play of cards that the appellant had purchased a sword a day earlier and that he had deposited the sword stained with human blood at the police station shortly after the murder.
evidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one u but the high court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of u showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened.
^ held, that the statement of u regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the high court.
extra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon.
the extra judicial confession in the present case was supported by the facts established, and these together fully established the guilt of the appellant.
