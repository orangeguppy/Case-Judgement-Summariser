the appellant, a postman, and i,is father were living in the same house.
certain undelivered postal articles were re covered from an almirah in the house, the key of which was produced by the father.
the appellant was tried and convicted of an offence under section 52 post offices act for secreting postal articles.
the appellant contended that since it had not been proved that he had been entrusted with these articles the offence under section 52 was not made out and that lie could not be held guilty of secreting as he was not in exclusive possession of these articles.
held, that entrustment was not an essential ingredient of the offence under section 52.
where the legislature intended to make entrustment an ingredient of the offence it had used appropriate words to make it clear.
it had used no such words in section 52.
to secrete means to hide.
in a case like the present, the retention of an undelivered postal article in an almirah for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that article.
held, further, that the appellant was not in exclusive possession of the postal articles and no inference could be drawn 409 that he had secreted them.
as the key was produced by the appellant 's father it could not be inferred that the appellant was in joint possession of the almirah much less that he was in exclusive possession of it.
no inference could be drawn from the fact that the almirah contained certain other articles belonging to the appellant as it also contained a large number of articles belonging to the father.
