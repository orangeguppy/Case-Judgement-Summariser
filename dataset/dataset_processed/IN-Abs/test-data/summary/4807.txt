the panchayat samiti had no right to appoint the appellant to the post of head clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the act by the amending act of 1973, the 735 panchayat samiti lost its power to make appointment to the panchayat.
it could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a head clerk, as it purported to do so, in january, 1974 on an adhoc basis or in april 1965 on a regular basis.
[737d] 1.2.
though the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service, in the instant case, the appointment of the appellant to the post of a head clerk being without the authority of law, the government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a head clerk.
he was appointed lawfully to the post of a clerk and that is the post in which the government has absorbed him.
