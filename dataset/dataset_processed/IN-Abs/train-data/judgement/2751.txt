these appeals are brought, by special leave, from the judgment of the high court of gujarat dated february 5, 1963 in appeal no. 1009 of 1960 arising out of civil suit no. 64 of 1958 filed by mussamiya imam haider bax razvi, appellant in civil appeal no. 312 of 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) against the respondents in civil appeal no. 312 of 1966 and the appellants (excepting the charity commissioner) in civil appeal no. 313 of 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the defendants).
the lands in dispute are located in the village isanpur and form part of a 'devasthan ' inam.
the 'sanads ' were created in the name of the ancestors of the plaintiff as the sarjudanashi of the estate of shah alam which was an estate consisting of 'roza ', a mosque, a grave yard and several other properties.
the estate was last held by the father of the plaintiff who expired on or about march 9, 1948 leaving behind him the plaintiff who was then a minor as his only heir.
on august 26, 1948 the collector of ahmedabad was appointed as the guardian of the properties of the plaintiff by an order of the district court, ahmedabad.
subsequently, on or about january 15, 1953, the then bombay government assumed management of the estate under the court of wards act, 1905 (bombay act no: 1 of 1905) and appointed the collector of ahmedabad as the manager of the same.
the case of the plaintiff is that the defendants fraudulently entered into a conspiracy with the collector 's subordinate staff for getting possession of the disputed lands.
in this connection the first defendant wrote to the district collector, ahmedabad on july 25, 1956 representing that certain persons formed or will form a co operative society for carrying on agriculture and therefore required the lands for that purpose.
defendants 1, 2, 3 and 5 also made applications for that purpose alleging that they were rabari, kept cattle and were residents of ahmedabad but none of them had any agricultural land.
on account of the fraud of the defendants the collector was prevailed upon to make an order 788 dated july 28, 1956 in breach of the provisions of sections 63 and 64 of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act (bombay act 67 of 1948), hereinafter referred to as the 'act ', and the rules made thereunder granting possession of the lands to the defendants who were neither carrying on agriculture on cooperative basis nor ever formed a co operative society.
it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the lease granted to the defendants was void and the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for recovery of possession of the lands from the defendants and also for a sum of ' rs. 10,000 for damages for use and occupation of the land prior to the date of the suit and ,for future mesne profits at the rate of rs. 500 per month.
the main written statement was filed by the first defendant and his contention was that the civil court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit.
it was said that valid lease had been created in favour of the defendants and as a result of the coming into force of the amending act (bombay act no. 13 of 1956) the defendants had become statutory owners of the lands in question.
the suit came up for hearing before the 5th joint civil judge, senior division at ahmedabad who by his judgment dated july 30, 1960, held that the civil court had jurisdiction to hear the suit and the provisions of the act did not apply to the suit lands and therefore the defendants were trespassers.
the learned judge accordingly granted a decree in favour of the plaintiff for recovery of possession of the lands from defendants 1 to 8.
he also granted the plaintiff a decree for a sum of rs. 10,000 as damages for use and occupation of the lands with interest at 6 per cent p.a. from august 1, 1956 till the date of the suit i.e., july 11, 1958.
the learned judge further ordered that the plaintiff was entitled to recover mesne profits to be determined under o.20, r. 12, civil procedure code.
defendants 1 to 8 took the matter in appeal to the high court of gujarat, being first appeal no. 1009 of 1960.
the high court held: (1 ) that the defendants had failed to establish that they had become statutory owners of the suit lands on or before the date of the suit, (2) that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the lease created either on july 28, 1956 or on august 24, 1956 was vitiated by fraud, and (3) that the civil court had no jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether the defendants were or were not tenants from the date of the suit and this question could only be decided by the revenue authorities.
for these reasons the high court directed that under section 85a of the ' act the following issue should be referred to the mamlatdar having jurisdiction in the matter for his decision and that the officer shall communicate his decision, or, if there are appeals from the decision, the final decision, to the high court as soon as possible.
the issue was as follows: "do the defendants prove that they are tenants of the lands in suit?" the high court further directed that the hearing of the appeal 789 should stand adjourned until after the relevant communication was received from the revenue authorities.
it is necessary at this stage to set out the relevant provisions of the act as it stood at the material time.
section 2(18) states: "2.

of land.
under section 63 may be granted ( 1 ) the collector or other officer authorized under the proviso to sub section (1 ) of section 63 shall not grant permission for the sale, gift, exchange, lease or mortgage of any land in favour of a person who is not either an agriculturist or an agricultural laboratory or who, being an agriculturist, cultivates personally land not less than the ceiling area whether as owner or tenant or partly as owner and partly as tenant unless any of the following conditions are satisfied : (a) such a person bona fide requires the land for a non agricultural purpose; or (b) the land is required for the benefit of an industrial or commercial undertaking or an educational or charitable institution; or (c) such land being mortgaged, the mortgagee has obtained from the collector a certificate that he intends to take the profession of an agriculturist and agrees to cultivate ,he land personally; or (d) the land is required by a co operative society; or the first question to be considered in this case is whether the high court was right in taking the view that the plaintiff failed to establish that the lease created on august 24, 1956 was vitiated by fraud.
it was contended by mr. s.t. desai on behalf of the plaintiff that the trial court had reached the finding that there was a conspiracy between the defendants and the collectables staff and the collector was induced by fraud and misrepresentation to grant lease in favour of the defendants.
it was argued that there was no justification for the high court to interfere with the finding of the trial judge on this point.
mr. s.t. desai took us through the relevant documentary evidence on this issue but having perused that evidence, we are satisfied that the high court was right in holding that the plaintiff had not established that there was any fraud or misrepresentation made to the collector or that there was a conspiracy between the defendants and the city deputy collector or his subordinates.
in this connection, the high court has referred to the circumstance that the offer made by the collector in his letter, exhibit 51 embodies 795 the conditions which are capable of being explained on the ground that the collector was aware of the fact that there was no co operative society in existence and that the defendants were not members of any! co operative society.
the high court also referred to the application, exhibit 5 3 which contains an endorsement of the city deputy collector that the defendants were given the lands for cultivation on co operative basis.
the high court also referred to the circumstance that neither the plaintiff nor his personal guardian had appeared in the witness box to support the allegation of fraud.
we are accordingly of the opinion that the high court was right in expressing the view that the lease in favour of the defendants was not vitiated by fraud and counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has been unable to make good his submission on this aspect of the case we pass on to consider the next question arising in this case, namely, whether the defendants had become statutory owners of the suit lands because of the provisions of section 32, section 32 f or section 88(1) of the act.
it is necessary to state at the outset that the amending act no. 13 of 1956 came into force on august 1, 1956.
it is not disputed by the parties that the act as it stood before the amending act 13 of 1956, applied to the suit land.
one of the sections which was amended by the amending act 13 of 1956 was section 88.
one of the effects of the amendment of section 88 was that sections 1 to 87a were not applicable to "an estate or land taken under the management of the court of wards".
so, it is not in dispute that after august 1, 1956 the provisions contained in sections 1 to 87a of the act did not apply to the suit lands.
it is also admitted that after the cessation of the management by the court of wards the provisions of the act again became applicable to the suit lands.
it has been found by the high court upon examination of the evidence that the court of wards withdrew its superintendence on may 11, 1958 when the order for the release of the management was actually passed and not on may 11, 1957 when the plaintiff attained majority.
it is evident therefore that the act applied to the suit lands before august 1, 1956, that sections 1 to 87a did not apply during the period between august 1, 1956 and may 11, 1958 which was the date on which the management of the estate by the court of wards ceased, and that the provisions of the act again applied to the suit lands after the cessation of such management.
on behalf of the defendants the argument was presented that there was a valid lease granted on july 28, 1956 and the defendants were tenants on april 1, 1957 i.e., the date of 'the tillers day ' under section 32 of the act and accordingly the defendants became statutory owners of the lands in suit under that section.
mr. hathi on behalf of the defendants challenged the finding of the high court that there was no valid lease created on july 28, 1956, but having gone through the relevant documentary 796 and oral evidence, we are satisfied that the defendants have not substantiated their case that there was any valid lease of the lands on july 28, 1956 and the high court was right in taking the view that the lease was created only on the execution of the ' 'kabuliyat ' dated august 24, 1956.
it follows from this finding that the defendants were not tenants on the 'tillers ' day ' mentioned in section 32 of the act.
the other question which arises in! this connection is whether the defendants became statutory owners because of the provisions contained in the first proviso to section 88 of the amended act.
the high court has found that the defendants were not subsisting tenants on may 11, 1958 which was the date on which there was a cessation of the management.
the reason was that the 'kabuliyat ' dated august 24, 1956 was a period of.
one year and having regard to the fact that the act was not applicable to the plaintiff 's estate from august 1, 1956 to may 11, 1958, the tenancy would expire on may 31, 1957 as provided for in the 'kabuliyat ' itself.
the high court therefore found that on the basis that the tenancy was created by the 'kabuliyat ' dated august 24, 1956, the tenancy came to an end on may 31, 1957, so that there was no subsisting tenancy on the date of the cessation of the management.
if there wag.
no subsisting lease on may 11, 1958, the high court was right in taking the view that the defendants had failed to establish that they had become statutory owners of the land by virtue of the first proviso to section 88 of the new act.
we proceed to consider the next question arising in this case, namely, whether the civil court had jurisdiction to decide the question whether the defendants were tenants of the suit lands on july 28, 1956 or on may 11, 1958 and whether the lease was created in favour of the defendants on july 28, 1956 as claimed by them or on august 24, 1956 as claimed by the plaintiff.
mr. hathi addressed the argument that the question whether the defendants were tenants with effect from july 28, 1956 or thereafter was an issue which was expressly triable by a revenue court under section 70 of the act and the jurisdiction of the civil court was barred.
it was argued that the issue of ownership was not the primary issue before the high court and the main question was whether the defendants were or were not the tenants of the suit lands on the material date, namely, july 28, 1956 or on may 11, 1958 and such a question lay within the scope of the jurisdiction of the revenue authorities.
in other words, it was argued that the determination of the question whether the lease was created which subsisted after august 1, 1956 or which subsisted also on may 11, 1958 was not a matter within the scope of the jurisdiction of the high court.
we are unable to accept the argument put forward by mr. hathi as correct.
section 70 (b) of the act imposes a duty on the mamlatdar to decide whether a person is a tenant, but the sub section 797 does not cast a duty upon him to decide whether a person was or was not a tenant in the past whether recent or remote.
the main question in the present case was the claim of the defendants that they had become statutory owners of the disputed lands because they were tenants either on the 'tillers ' day ' or on the date of the release of the management by the court of wards.
in either case, the question for decision will be not whether the defendants were tenants on the date of the suit but the question would be whether they were or were not tenants in the past.
the question whether the defendants were tenants on july 28, 1956 or on may 11, 1958 was not an independent question but it was put forward by the defendants as a reason for substantiating their plea of statutory ownership.
in other words, the plea of tenancy on the two past dates was a subsidiary plea and the main plea was of statutory ownership and the jurisdiction of the civil court cannot therefore be held to be barred in this case by virtue of the provisions of section 70 of the act read with the provisions of section 85 of the act.
we are accordingly of the opinion that section 85 read with section 70 of the act does not bar the jurisdiction of the civil court to examine and decide the question whether the defendants had acquired the title of statutory owners to the disputed lands under the new act.
in this context, it is necessary to bear in mind the important principle of construction which is that if a statute purports to exclude the ordinary jurisdiction of a civil court it must do so either by express terms or by the use of such terms as would necessarily lead to the inference of such exclusion.
as the judicial committee observed in secretary of state vs mask & co.(1) "it is settled law that the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts is not to be readily inferred, but that such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied.
" in our opinion, there is nothing in the language or context of section 70 or section 85 of the act to suggest that the jurisdiction of the civil court is expressly or by necessary implication barred with regard to the question whether the defendants had become statutory owners of the land and to decide in that connection whether the defendants had been in the past tenants in relation to the land on particular past dates.
we are also of the opinion that the jurisdiction of the civil court is not barred in considering the question whether the provisions of the act are applicable or not applicable to the disputed land during a particular period.
we accordingly reject the argument of mr. hathi on this aspect of the case.
(1) 67 i.a. 222, 236. 798 the next contention on behalf of the plaintiff is that the high court was in error in referring to the mamlatdar under section 85a of the act, the issue whether "the defendants were tenants of the land in suit".
it was pointed out by mr. s.t. desai that the high court had rejected the contention of the defendants that the tenancy was created on july 28, 1956 but the defendants were tenants only with effect from august 24, 1956.
the high court has further found that there was no subsisting tenancy on may 11, 1958 when there was a cessation of the management of the court of wards.
the suit was brought by the plaintiff on july 11, 1958 and the argument put forward on behalf of the plaintiff is that there was no plea on behalf of the defendants that there was any intervening act, event or transaction between may 11, 1958 and july 11, 1958 under which a fresh tenancy was created.
in other words, the argument on behalf of the plaintiff was that the only plea set up on behalf of the defendants was the plea of tenancy on july 28, 1956 which was the basis of the plea of statutory ownership.
it was said that there was no other plea of tenancy set up by the defendants subsequent to may 11, 1958 when the management of the court of wards ceased.
in our opinion, the argument is well founded and must be accepted as correct.
on behalf of the defendants mr. hathi referred to paragraphs 4 and 6 of the written statement of the first defendant dated september 18, 1958, but, in our opinion, both these paragraphs must be read together and the plea of tenancy in para 4 is based upon the: claim of the defendants that they were "lawful ' tenants of the suit lands and they got this right before august 1, 1956".
the plea of tenancy is therefore based upon the alleged lease of july 28, 1956 which is rolled up in the plea of substantive claim of statutory ownership.
on a proper interpretation of the language of paragraphs 4.
and 6 of the written statement we are satisfied that there is no independent plea of tenancy set up by the defendants as subsisting on ' the date of the suit and there was no issue which survived for being referred for the decision of the mamlatdar under section 85a of the act.
we are accordingly of the opinion that the high court was in error in referring any fresh issue to the mamlatdar but instead should have granted a decree to the plaintiff for recovery of possession the lands and also as to damages and mesne profits as decreed by the trial court.
for the reasons expressed we hold that civil appeal no. 312 of 1966 must be allowed and the judgment of the high court dated february 5, 1963 should be set aside and the decree of the 5th joint civil judge, senior division at ahmedabad dated july 30.
1960 should be restored.
civil appeal no. 313 of 1966 is dismissed.
the plaintiff will be entitled to the costs of 799 this court (one set of hearing fees) but we do not propose to make any order with regard to the costs incurred by the parties in the high court.
the application filed by the defendants for leave to produce additional evidence in this court is rejected.
c.a. 312 of 1966 allowed.
v.p.s. c.a. 313 of 1966 dismissed.
