" underneath the certificate of niranjan naik, section officer brahmananda misra sub divisional officer appended his certificate and signed the same.
therefore, the bills were checked in the office of the executive engineer who made the payments by means of the cheques.
on november 16, 1961 i.e. after the first two supplies but before the third supply, lingaraj das (p.w.7) addressed confidential communication (exh. 6) to gopinath patra hinting to him that according to the information received by him the supplies made by nakula sahu were not according to the specifications in the supply order but were of lower class and requiring him to 'verify the quality of each and every wash hand basin and to give a certificate if they were of first class quality as per specification in the tender.
by means of the aforesaid confidential letter, gopinath patra was also told to submit a detailed 446 report about the quality of the wash hand basins within four days in case he found that they were not of first quality as per specifications in the tender.
gopinath patra was also asked to intimate the number of wash hand basins supplied by the cuttack plumbing stores and the amount paid to it.
as gopinath patra did not comply with the aforesaid communication within the aforesaid time, p.w. 7 sent him a reminder to expedite the reply but it was not before december 9 1961 that the former sent the reply (exh. 7) certifying that 894 wash hand basins which had been supplied by then by the cuttack plumbing stores were all of first quality.
by means of exhibit (7), gopinath patra further informed the public health engineer, orissa that the cuttack plumbing stores had so far been paid rs. 66,960.60, including sales tax, for the aforesaid 894 wash hand basins.
on december 19, 1961, p.w. 7 placed order (exh. 5) with cuttack plumbing stores for further supply of 500 wash hand basins of the aforesaid quality and make at the rate of rs. 68/ per basin to be delivered to the public health department 's godown at bhubaneswar and sent intimation thereof to gopinath patra.
accordingly, nakula sahu supplied 50 wash hand basins on january 4, 1962, 410 wash hand basins on october 1, 1962 and 40 wash hand basins on october 14, 1962 and submitted bills (exhibits 29, 32 and 35) for rs. 3,638.00, rs. 29,831.60 and rs. 2,910.40 respectively.
on these three bills also, brahmananda misra, sub divisional officer and niranjan naik, section officer appended certificates similar to those which they had given on the previous bills.
on the basis of the said certificates, running account bills were prepared and signed by gopinath patra, executive engineer, and payments were made to nakula sahu.
on march 28,1963, the inspector of police, vigilance, cuttack seized vide seizure memo (exh. 73) from the public health godown bhubaneswar, of which niranjan naik, section officer was incharge, 593 barang make wash hand basins alleged to have been supplied to the department by the cuttack plumbing stores and a.b. ghosh (p.w.8), executive engineer, stores verification division, attached to the works department inspected these basins under the orders of the secretary, works and transport department and submitted his report (exh. 49) dated september 9/13,1963 enclosing therewith statements (exhibits 50 and 51) containing his remarks in respect of each and every one of 593 basins examined by him.
in his report (exh. 49) a.b. ghosh inter alia stated: "not a single basin of first quality could be found during verification.
three type of basins with manufacturer marks ii and iii class and with no marks are found.
all the basins which have been verified have different types of defects as noted against each number in the enclosed statements.
in several cases major defects have been noticed in all the type of basins and the nature of major 447 defects have also been noted in the statements.
" thereupon the. authorities made an inquiry from m/s orissa industries ltd. barang (producers of the basins) which revealed that the cuttack plumbing stores had during its entire transactions with the former purchased only three first quality wash hand basins and the rest of the wash hand basins purchased by it by auction or otherwise from the company and dishonestly passed not to and accepted by respondents, niranjan naik, brahmananda misra and gopinath patra as first quality wash hand basins were either second quality or rejected ones which did not at all conform to the specifications mentioned in the tender quotations (exh. 23 and the supply order (exh. 4).
on these facts, the respondents were charged with and proceeded against for commission of various offences of criminal conspiracy, abetment of and commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust in respect of a sum of rs. 1,11,280/ entrusted by the state to gopinath patra, respondent for purchase of best quality wash hand basins with the result as stated above in these appeals, it has been urged by counsel for the state of orissa that the facts and circumstances proved in the case are incompatible with the innocence of the respondents and are incapable of explanation on any hypothesis other than the guilt of the respondents for the offences with which they were charged and that the order of their acquittal passed by the high court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction which as acknowledged by this court is a limited one has resulted in grave failure of justice.
on the other hand, it has been contended by counsel for the defence that there is no infirmity in the impugned order and the high court was justified in acquitting the respondent in exercise of its plenary revisional power as the material on record was not sufficient to sustain their conviction on the submission of counsel for the parties, two principal points arise for consideration by us (1) the scope of the power of revision under section 439 read with section 435 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898 and when it should be exercised and (2) whether in arriving at concurrent findings, the trial court and the sessions judge committed any manifest error on a point of law which had resulted in flagrant miscarriage of`justice.
so far as the first point is concerned, it is to be emphasized that although the revisional power of the high court under section 439 read with section 435 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898 is as wide as the power of court of appeal under section 423 of the code, it is now well settled that normally the jurisdiction of the high court under section 439 is to be exercised only in exceptional cases when 448 there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a mainfest error on a point of law which has consequently resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice.
reference in this connection may be made to the decisions of this court in amar chand agarwalla vs shanti bose & anr.
etc.(1) and akalu ahdr vs ramdeo ram(2), in the latter case viz. akalu ahir vs ramdeo ram (supra) this court follolwing its earlier decision in amar chand agarwalla vs shanti bose & anr etc.
(supra) held that in spite of the wide language of section 435 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898 which empowered it to satisfy itself as to the correctness legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed by any inferior court situate within the limits of its jurisdiction and as to the regularity of any proceeding of such inferior court and in spite of the fact that under section 439 of the code it can exercise inter alia the power conferred on a court of appeal under section 423 of the code, the high court is not expected to act under section 435 or section 439 as if it is hearing on appeal.
the power being discretionary, it has to be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily or lightly.
judicial discretion, as has often been said, means a discretion which is informed by tradition, methodised by analogy and disciplined by system.
this takes us to the consideration of the second point.
in relation to this point, it may be observed that nothing has been brought to our notice on behalf of the respondents to indicate that there was any glaring defect in the procedure adopted by the lower courts or that there was a manifest error on a point of law in the judgments and orders passed by them which had resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice which needed to be set right by the high court.
a scrutiny of the evidence which we have made at the request of the counsel for the parties shows that there was not even any misappreciation of evidence on the record by the lower courts which could be said to have resulted in gross failure of justice warranting interference by the high court.
we may at this stage indicate that while adverting to the evidence, we shall be confining ourselves to the case against gopinath patra and niranjan naik, respondents in appeals nos. 26 and 28 of 1972 respectively, as the other two appeals nos. 25 and 27 of 1972 against nakula sahu and brahmananda misra have abated due to their death during the pendency of the appeals in this court.

the plea of gopinath patra that he acted bonafide on the certificates of the section officer and divisional officer whose duty it was to verify the quality of each and every wash hand basins on receipt of the consignments and passed bills nos. 19, 22 and 25 in a casual manner and that 894 wash hand basins which he inspected under orders of the public health engineer conveyed to him vide exhibit 6 were of barang make, first quality, and 593 wash hand basins which were seized by p.w. 17 under exhibit 73 were not from 894 wash hand basins verified by him in exhibit 7 is totally falsified by the clinching evidence furnished by exhibit 7 dated december 9, 1961 which.
it will be recalled was sent by gopinath patra in rely to the confidential communication addressed to him by p.w. 7.
in this exhibit 7 gopinath patra clearly informed p.w. 7 that he had inspected each and every one of the 894 wash hand basins which had up to that date been supplied by the cuttack plumbing stores and found them all of class 1 barang make.
the conclusion is, therefore, irresistible that gopinath patra actively connived at the delivery and acceptance of inferior quality of wash hand basins by the supplier which did not at all conform to the specifications given in the tender submitted by it or in the supply order placed by him and dishonestly passed orders for payment of first quality goods knowing that the wash hand basins supplied were of inferior quality and thus committed criminal breach of trust in respect of a huge amount of government funds and that in order to conceal his guilt he purposely gave false certificate vide exhibit 7 that 894 wash band basins supplied by the cuttack plumbing stores (out of which 593 456 were seized by p.w. 17 and verified by p.w. 8 to be defective and of ii or iii quality) were all of first quality and conformed to the specifications in the supply order although in the proved facts and circumstances, none could be of first quality.
that this was so and he furnished the aforesaid certificate even without caring to visit the public health department store, bhubaneswar for physical verification as directed by his superior is further evident from the fact that he omitted to make even a mention in exhibit 7 about the quality of 106 numbers of wash hand basins which had been indisputably received in the store before he sent reply exhibit 7 to the aforesaid confidential query made by p.w. 7 vide exhibit 6.
the further plea of the accused that 593 wash hand basins seized from the public health department store by p.w. 17 were not from amongst those supplied by the cuttack plumbing stores also stands negatived from the evidence of p.w. 8 (who verified the said wash hand basins at the pointing out of niranjan naik) as also from the evidence of p.ws. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 17.
thus it is manifest that neither the trial court nor the sessions judge committed any error of fact or of law in arriving at their conclusions and the high court misdirected itself in upsetting their concurrent findings ignoring the well recognised principles for the exercise of revisional jurisdiction.
from the material on the record.
we are satisfied that the offences with which gopinath patra and niranjan naik were charged were brought home to them beyond any reasonable doubt.
from the foregoing reasons, we set aside the aforesaid judgment and order of the high court acquitting gopinath patra and niranjan naik and convict them for the offences with which they were charged and held guilty by the trial court.
keeping however, in view the fact that the said respondents are likely to lose their jobs and must have gone through a lot of mental and financial strain during the prolonged proceedings before the courts lasting for over fourteen years, we think that a consolidated fine of rs. 10,000/ in ease of each of the respondents will meet the ends of justice.
accordingly while remitting the substantive sentence of imprisonment, we impose a sentence of fine of rs. 10,000/ on each one of the said respondents viz. gopinath patra and niranjan naik.
in default of payment of fine, each one of the said respondents shall undergo imprisonment for a period of six months.
the fine shall be deposited within a 457 period of two months from today failing which the aforesaid respondents shall surrender themselves to their bail bonds to undergo the aforesaid imprisonment imposed on them in default of payment of fine.
p.b.r. appeal allowed.
