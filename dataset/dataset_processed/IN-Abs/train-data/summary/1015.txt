for the purposes of its business the respondent borrowed a certain sum of money from the bank of india on a pronote executed jointly by him and one kishorilal in accordance with a commercial practice of carrying on business by borrowing money from banks on joint and several liability.
the money was divided half and half between the respondent and kishorilal but kishorilal failed to pay off his liability as he became a bankrupt and the respondent had to pay the whole amount to the bank.
the respondent, however, received from the official assignee a part of the sum taken by the kishorilal leaving a balance still unpaid.
the respondent 's claim to deduct this unpaid balance under section 10(2)(xv) of the income tax act was refused by the income tax officer and the appellate assistant commissioner but was allowed by the income tax appellate tribunal on appeal.
on a reference made at the instance of the appellant the high court decided the question in favour of the respondent assessee.
on appeal by the appellant by special leave, held, that the view taken by the high court was correct.
on the finding that there was a well establised commercial practice of financing business by borrowing money on joint and several liability and by so doing the respondent could borrow at a lower rate of interest, and that there was mutuality between the borrowers for standing surety for each other for loans taken for business purposes, the respondent assessee in computing his business profits was entitled to deduct the loss suffered by him in paying the sum not paid by his co borrower.
