under article 246(2) and (3) of the constitution, the legis lature of a state has plenary powers to legislate with respect to matters enumerated in lists ii and iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution.
the legislative competence of the state legisla 165 ture can only be circumscribed by express prohibition contained in the constitution itself and unless there is any provision in the constitution expressly prohibiting legislation on a subject either absolutely or conditionally, there is no fetter or limitation on the plenary powers which the state legislature enjoys to legislate on the topics enumerated in lists ii and iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution.
in view of article 246 of the constitution, no curtailment of legislative competence can be spelt out of the terms of clause 5 of the letters of guarantee given by the dominion government to the rulers of "states" subsequent to the agreements of merger, which guaranteed, inter alia, the continuance of jagirs in the merged "states".
indeed, clause 5 of the letters of guarantee itself saved the legislative right of the state of bombay subject to the limitation that enactments of the state shall not be discriminatory in nature.
attacks on the validity of the said act on the basis of the rights guaranteed by articles 14, 19(1)(f), and 32(2) of the constitution cannot be countenanced in view of article 31 a(2)(a) of the constitution, article 363 (1) of the constitution barred the jurisdiction of courts in disputes arising out of any provision of the agreements of merger and the letters of guarantee.
held, that bombay act xxxix of 1954, the impugned act, was intra vires the state legislature.
