the respondents agreed to sell their agricultural land to the appellants.
the title deeds and possession of the land were given to the appellants and both parties jointly applied to the district deputy collector, thana prant, under section 63 of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act, 1948, seeking permission for the sale.
the permission was refused on the ground that the intending purchaser had failed to obtain a certificate from the collector under rule 36(f) of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands rules 1956, that he intended to take to the profession of agricul ture and was capable of cultivating land personally.
the appellants thereafter obtained the requisite sanction from the additional collector, thana, in spite of the respond ents ' non cooperation.
a suit by the respondents for de claring the agreement void in law was decreed by the trial court.
in appeal, the high court opined that the prant officer 's refusal to permit the sate had rendered the agree ment impossible of performance.
allowing the appeal, the court.
held: (1) the parties are governed by section 56 of the contract act according to which a contract becomes void only if something supervenes after its execution which renders it impracticable or impossible of performance.
the order of the prant officer was not of such a catastrophic character.
