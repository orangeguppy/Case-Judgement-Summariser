the appellant was carrying on business, but was not residing within the town area of karhal.
the town area committee imposed a tax of rs. 25 on him under clause (f) of a. 14(1) of the u.p. town areas act, 1914, being a tax on 'circumstances and property '.
the appellant filed a writ application in the high court on the ground that there could be no assessment under clause (f) because he resided outside the jurisdiction of the town are& committee.
the high court dismissed the application taking the view that it was unnecessary to consider whether the tax could be legally imposed under clause (f) as the tax imposed could clearly be justified under clause (d) of section 14(1) which authorised the imposition of a tax on trades, callings or professions.
held, that residence was not a sine qua non for the imposition of the tax under clause (f), that the carrying on of 'business within the town area was a sufficient nexus for the imposition of the tax under clause (f) and that the assessment of the tax on the appellant under clause (f) was legally valid.
the legality of the tax imposed must be considered with ref erence to the clause under which the assessment was actually made and a different clause under which the assessment might have fallen cannot be called in aid of the assessment.
rule 3 of the 'rules regarding the limitations, restrictions and rate subject to which the circumstances and property tax shall be levied by the town area committees ' framed under section 39(2) of the act does not go beyond section 14(1)(f) and is not invalid.
