the court in whose jurisdiction sub standard fertilizer was found to be marketed will have the jurisdiction to try manufacturer of sub standard fertilizer even if the manufacturing activity is at an entirely different place.
the manufacturer as well as the dealer can be tried at a place where the consequences of the manufacturing and selling of sub standard fertilizer had ensued as envisaged in sections 179 and 180 of the code of criminal procedure.

now if manufacturing sub standard fertilizer is by itself an offence and marketing the sub standard fertilizer is itself a distinct offence but they are so inter connected as cause and effect, both can be tried at one or the other place.
if one manufacturers the sub standard fertilizer, wherever it is marketed the inter relation or casual connection is of cause and effect.
the situation will be adequately covered by sections 179 and 180 of the code of criminal procedure.
