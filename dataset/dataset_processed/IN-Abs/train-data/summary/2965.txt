the petitioner was a deputy inspector of schools and a member of the education department of the respondent state.
on september 2, 1953, the director of public instruction passed an order directing a censure to be recorded in the character roll of the petitioner.
on march 5, 1960, he was reverted to the lower division of the subordinate educational service, as a result of an inquiry into certain charges.
he filed a suit challenging the two orders.
on august 5, 1961, the munsiff passed an order restraining the respondent from enforcing the order dated march 5, 1960.
on april 3, 1962, the temporary injunction was vacated by the subordinate judge.
on april 11, 1963, the suit was decreed and the respondent was prohibited from enforcing the order dated march 5, 1960.
this decree was set aside in appeal by the subordinate judge on june 24, 1964, and the petitioner 's second appeal was dismissed by the high court on february 11, 1965.
on august 5, 1966, the director of public instruction passed an order that the petitioner 'having not been on his duties for more than five years since march 1, 1960 has ceased to be in government employ since march 2, 1965 under r. 76 of the bihar service code. ' the petitioner having completed 58 years of age addressed a letter to the director of public instruction on july 18, 1967 requesting him to arrange for the payment of her.
pension, and on june 12, 1968 the director of public instruction passed orders stating that under r. 46 of the bihar pension rules he was not entitled to any pension.
the petitioner filed the present writ petition under article 32 challenging the various orders.
held: (1) no relief could be granted in respect of the orders dated september 2, 1953 and march 5, 1960, as, (a) they were already covered by the decision of the high court in second appeal.
(b) no relief could be granted with respect to an order passed as early as 1953; and (c) the orders did not infringe any fundamental rights of the petitioner.
[652g h 653a b] (2) the order dated august 5, 1966, declaring, under r. 76 of the service code that the petitioner had ceased to be in government service should be set aside.
[653 a b] (a) the essential requirement for taking action under the said rule is that the government servant should have been continuously absent from duty for over five years.
under this rule it is immaterial whether absence from duty by the government servant was with or without leave so long as it is established that he was absent from duty for a continuous period for over five years.
admittedly the petitioner, in the present case, was on duty till march 10, 1960 and he ceased to attend to his duty only from march 635 11, 1960.
therefore, the order stating that he 'ceased to be in government employ on march 2, 1965, was on the face of it erroneous. ' [643c d, e; 644a c] (b) assuming that the order should be read that the petitioner was not on his duty continuously for more than five years from march 11, 1960 till august 5, 1966 the date of the order even then, the order would be illegal.
from august 5, 1961, the date of temporary injunction granted by the munsiff till april 3, 1962, when that order was vacated by the subordinate judge, the department did not allow the petitioner to join duty in the senior post in spite of several letters written by him.
again on april 11, 1963 when the munsiff granted a decree in favour of the petitioner, the respondent did not obtain any stay order from the appellate court, and so, the decree of the trial court was in full force till it was set aside in appeal on june 24, 1964.
during that period, that is, from april 11, 1963 to june 24, 1964 the petitioner wrote several letters requesting the respondent to permit him to join duty in the senior grade, but the respondent did not permit him to do so.
therefore, there was no question of the petitioner being continuously absent from service for over 5 years during the period referred to when he was willing but the respondent did not allow him to serve, and hence, r. 76 of the service code was not applicable.
[644e f; 645a d,g; 646d h; 647a b,e f] (c) even if the r. 76 was applicable and it was a question of automatic termination of service, article 311 applies to such cases also.
according to the respondents a continuous absence from duty for over five years apart from resulting in the forfeiture of the office also amounts to misconduct under r. 46 of the pension rules disentitling the office to receive pension.
the respondent did not give an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against the order proposed.
hence there was violation of article 311.
[647gh ; 648d e] jai shankar vs state of rajasthan, ; , followed.
(3) the order dated june 12, 1968 stating that under r. 46 of the pension rules the petitioner was not entitled to any pension should also be set aside.
[649c] payment of pension under the rules does not depend upon the discretion of the state government but is governed by the rules and a government servant, coming within those rules is entitled to claim pension.
under r. 46 a government servant dismissed or removed for misconduct, insolvency or inefficiency is not eligible for pension.
in the present case it was contended that the petitioner 's absence for over five years, amounted to misconduct and inefficiency in service.
but when the order dated august 5, 1966 has been held to be illegal then the order dated june 12, 1968 based upon it also falls to the ground.
[649b c;d h;65oa b] (4) the grant of pension does not depend upon any order.
it is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to the service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authorities to pass an order to that effect, but the right to receive pension flows to an officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the rules.
the right of the petitioner to receive pension is property under article 31(1) and by a mere executive order the state had no power to withhold it.
similarly, the said claim is also property under article 19(1) (f).
it, therefore follows, that the order dated june 12, 1968 denying the petitioner the right to receive pension affected his fundamental right and as such the writ petition was maintainable.
[650g h; 652b c, d f] k. r. erry vs state of punjab, i.l.r. [1967] punjab & haryana 279, (f.b) approved.
636 (5) the bar against the civil court entertaining any suit relating to the matters under the pension act does not stand in the way of a writ of mandamus being issued to the state to properly consider the claim of the petitioner for payment of pension according to law.
