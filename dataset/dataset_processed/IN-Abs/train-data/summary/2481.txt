the appellant entered into a contract with the government of india.
the contract contained an arbitration clause.
for certain supplies made under the contract the appellant made representations to the government or payment and for arbitration of disputes.
on or about july 10, 1958 government refused to refer the matter for arbitration.
on july 11, 1961 the appellant flied an application in the court of the district judge under sections 8 and 20 of the , for filing the arbitration agreement and for an order of reference of the disputes to an arbitrator appointed by the court.
the respondent contended that the application was barred by limitation.
the district judge allowed the application, holding that there was no limitation for making an application under sections 8 and 20.
the defendant 's appeal was dismissed by the high court as incompetent in so far as it challenged the order under section 8 but was allowed in so far as it challenged the order under section 20.
the high court held that an application under section 20 is governed 'by article 181 of the indian limitation act, 1908.
in coming to this conclusion the high court took into account the settled judicial view that the.
operation of article 181 is limited to applications under the code of civil procedure.
and reasoned as follows: article 181 should be construed as if the words 'under the code ' were added in it.
the repealed paragraph 17 of the second schedule to the code and re enacted it in section 70 with minor modifications.
that being so section 8(1) of the applied and the implied reference in article 181 to paragraph 17 of the second schedule to the code should be construed as a reference to section 20 of the .
appeal against the high court 's judgment was filed with certificate.
held: the 'appeal must be allowed.
by the the legislature amended articles 158 and 178 of the limitation act and made them applicable to the relevant proceedings under the but no similar change was made in article 181.
it is manifest that save as provided in articles 158 and 178 there would not be any limitation for other applications under the act.
further there is nothing to indicate that for the purpose of limitation section 20 of the 1940 act should be regarded as a re enactment of the corresponding provision of the code and not of the indian arbitration act, 1899.
[236 d g] in the circumstances it is not possible to construe the implied reference in article 181 to the code of civil procedure as a reference to the or to hold that article 181 applies to applications under that act.
the rule of construction given in section 8(1)of the cannot be applied, as it appears that the legislature had a 233 different intention.
it follows that an application under sections 8 and 20 of the is not governed by article 181.
the limitation act does not prescribe any period of limitation for such an application.
[236 g h] the present application under sections 8 and 20 was therefore not barred by limitation.
