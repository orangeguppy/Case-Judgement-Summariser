h took a truck on hire from the respondent company.
the truck was found to contain contraband opium and h was tried for offences under sections 9a and 9b of the opium act (10 of 1878) as modified by the opium (madhya bharat amendment) act 1955.
the company made an application for the release of the truck but the magistrate while acquitting h on the ground that he had no knowledge that the truck was carrying opium, confiscated the truck under section 11 of the madhya bharat act.
he took the view that the use of the word 'shall ' in that section gave him no option but to confiscate the truck.
the sessions judge took the same view but the high court held that the word 'shall in the context of the section was not mandatory and in the circumtances of the case the truck should not have been confiscated.
the state appealed to this by special, leave.
held: the word 'shall ' is not always mandatory; it depends upon the context in which the word occurs and the other circumstances [475h] three considerations are relevant in construing section 11.
first it would be unjust to confiscate the truck of a person if he has no knowledge whatsoever that the track was being used for transporting the opium.
secondly it is a penal '.
statute and it should if possible be construed in such a way that a person who has not committed or abetted any offence should not be visited with a penalty.
thirdly, if confiscation was obligatory under the section, the section may have to be struck down as imposing an unreasonable restrictions under article 19 of the constitution.
[476 a d] section 11 of the madhya bharat act is not therefore to be construed as obligatory and it is for the court to consider in each case whether the articles in which the contraband opium is found or is being transported should be confiscated or not having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
