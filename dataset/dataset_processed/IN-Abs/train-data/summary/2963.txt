[500 g h] (2) having been a citizen of india at the commencement of the constitution and not being a foreigner under the foreigners act at the date of his entry, till the central government determined the question of the respondent having acquired pakistan nationality and thereby lost indian nationality, he could not be treated as a foreigner and no penal action could be taken against him.
[497 g; 501 ' a b] (3) the order of the central government dated november 5, 1964 determining that the respondent was a pakistani was final, but the determination by the central government could not have the effect of retrospectively rendering his stay in india before that date a penal offence.
it was not as if he was given any directions after november 5, 1964, which were disobeyed by him entailing his prosecution.
