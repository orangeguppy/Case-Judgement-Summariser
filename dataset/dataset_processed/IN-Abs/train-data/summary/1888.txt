in 1950 by a resolution of the ministry of home affairs a reservation was fixed for scheduled castes and tribes to the extent of 12 1/2% and 5% respectively in respect of vacancies in public services to be filled from year to year.
in 1952.
a "carry forward" rule was introduced whereby the unfilled reserved vacancies of a particular year would be carried forward for on year only.
in 1955 the above rule was substituted by another providing that the unfilled reserved vacancies of a particular year would be carried forward for two years.
in 1960 a limited competitive examination was held by the union public service commission for promtion to the post of section officers.
the petitioner who was an assistant in the central secretariat service appeared at this examination and secured the 37th rank.
although 43 appointments were made as a result of the examination the petitioner could not be appointed because under the 1955 "carry forward" rule as many as 28 vacancies were to be filled by scheduled caste and scheduled tribes candidates.
in 1963 the 1955 rule was declared invalid by this court in devadasan '.s case, whereupon the petitioner filed a petition under article 32.
he claimed that the 1952 "carry forward" rule having been substituted by the 1955 rule, and the latter having been declared unconstitutional there was no "carry forward" rule in existence in 1960 and therefore by virtue of his rank in the examination he ought to be appointed to the post of section officer.
held : (i) when l 1952 "cary forward" rule was substituted by the rule of 1955 the former ceased to exist.
the 1955 rule having been declared unconstitutional in devadasan 's case there was no "carry forward" rule in existence in 1960 when the petitioner appeared at the examination.
[426 f g] (ii) it must made clear that the judgment of this court in devada.vans ' case was only concerned with that part of the instructions of the government of india which deal with the "carry forward" rule; it did not in any way touch the reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes at 12 1/2% and 5% respectively.
this reservation had to be given effect to.
after allowing for these reservations only 34 unreserved vacancies were left to be filled and the petitioner 's rank being lower, he could not succeed.
