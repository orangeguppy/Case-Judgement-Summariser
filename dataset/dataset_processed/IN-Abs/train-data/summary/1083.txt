entry 52 of list ii of the seventh schedule to the consti tution empowered state legislatures to make a law relating to "taxes on the entry of goods into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein".
the u. p. legislature passed the u. p. sugarcane cess act, 1956, which authorised the state government to impose a cess on the entry of cane into the premises of a factory for use, consumption or sale therein.
the appellant contended that the premises of a factory was not a 'local area ' within the meaning of entry 52 and the act was beyond the competence of the legislature.
243 held, (per imam, kapur, das gupta and raghubar dayal, jj.) that the impugned act was beyond the competence of the legislature and was invalid.
the premises of a factory was not a "local area" within the meaning of entry 52.
the proper meaning to be attached to the words "local area" in entry 52 was an area administered by a local body like a municipality, a district board, a local board, a union board, a panchayat or the like.

per ayyangar, j.
the act was invalid only in so far as it sought to levy a tax on cane entering a factory from within the same local area in which the factory was situate and was valid in other cases.
it was permissible to read the act so as to confine the tax to the limitations subject to which it could be constitutionally levied and to strike down that portion which out stepped the limitations.
