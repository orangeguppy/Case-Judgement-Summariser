the respondent as a tenant of tile appellant was occupying a portion of the premises in question for residence and the other major portion for his professional work as an ear, nose, throat specialist.
the appellant sued for the ejectment of the respondent on the grounds that (i) he required the premises for his own residence and that (ii) the respondent had built a suitable residence for himself in another locality.
the first plea was based on the ground mentioned in section 133(1)(e) and the second plea on section 13(1)(h) of the delhi and ajmer rent control act, 1952.
the trial court decreed the suit but the appellate court and the high court dismissed it on the finding that from the beginning of the tenancy a substantial part of the premises was used by the respondent for his professional work obviously with the consent of the appellant.
held, that premises let for residential purposes but used by 679 the tenant with the consent of the landlord incidentally for commercial, professional or other purposes cease to be premises let for a residential purpose alone and as such the landlord would not be entitled to eject the tenant under section 13(1)(e) of the act.
nor can such a tenant be ejected independently under section 13(1)(h) because a tenancy created or used both for residence and profession cannot be terminated merely by showing that the tenant had acquired a suitable residence.
premises let both for residence and commercial purposes do not cease to be premises under section 2(g) and continue to be so under the last clause of section 2(g).
