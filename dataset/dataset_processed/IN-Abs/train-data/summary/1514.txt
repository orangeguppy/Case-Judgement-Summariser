although section 135 of the indian contract act does not in terms apply to a surety bond executed in favour of the court, there can be no doubt that the equitable rule underlying that section must apply to it.
the reason for the said rule which entitles the surety to a discharge is that he must be able at any time either to require the creditor to call upon the principal debtor to pay off his debt, or himself to pay the debt and seek his remedy against the principal debtor.
the question as to whether the liability of the surety is discharged by a compromise in the judicial proceeding in which the surety bond is executed must depend on the terms of the bond itself.
if the terms indicate that the surety undertook the liability on the basis that the dispute should be 922 decided on the merits by the court and not amicably settled, the compromise will effect a discharge of the surety.

but if the terms show that the parties and the surety contemplated that there might be an amicable settlement as well, anti the surety executed the bond knowing that he might be liable under the compromise decree, there can be no discharge and the surety will be liable under the compromise decree.
