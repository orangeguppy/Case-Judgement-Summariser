the petitioner, an associations of dealers engaged in the business of selling dry fruit in north india, who purchase dry fruits either locally or through imports from outside india, challenged the grant of additional licences to the respondents diamond exporters, under article 32 of the constitution.
on behalf of the petitioners, it was contended: (i) that the goods sought to be imported on the additional licences included those which were prohibited by the prevalent import policy; (ii) that the principle which was applied to the import of acrylic easter monomers extends likewise to the import of all other commodities under additional licences granted to diamond exporters in similar circumstances and, therefore, the diamond exporters are not entitled to import dry fruit; and (iii) that the import of dry fruit is covered by item 121 in appendix 2 part b (list of restricted items) of the import policy 1985 88 and, therefore, the respondents are not entitled to resort to item 1 of appendix 6.
on behalf of the respondents, it was contended: (i) that paragraph 176 of the import policy 1978 79 envisages the grant of additional licences for the import of raw materials which have been placed on open general licence for actual users (industrial); (ii) that they import the dry fruits as raw material for the purpose of selling to eligible industrial actual users for processing for manufacturing into a variety of products under item 1 of appendix 6 of the import policy 1985 86; (iii) that item 121 of appendix 2 part b (list of restricted items) is not attracted because it refers to "consumer goods", and consumer goods 89 are not raw material for the purposes of item 1 of appendix 6; and (iv) that the petition under article 32 is not maintainable because the petitioners ' fundamental rights are not violated, in as much as no appeal has been filed by the customs authorities or by the import control authorities against the interim order dated january 8, 1986 of the high court directing the customs authorities to permit the respondents to clear the imported consignment of almonds.
allowing the writ petition and the appeal, ^ held: 1.
respondents nos. 10 and 11 are restrained from importing dry fruits during the period 1985 88 under the additional licences granted to them under the import policy 1978 79.
[97f] 2.
under the import policy 1978 79, dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts) could be imported by all persons for whatever purpose under the open general licence.
no additional licence was required.
by wrongful denial of additional licence to diamond exporters no damage can be said to have been suffered by them and no question of restitution could, therefore, be said to arise.
the wrongful denial of the additional licences was wholly immaterial to the importing of dry fruits (exluding cashewnuts).
the respondents have not shown that the dry fruits were placed on open general licence specifically for actual users (industrial).
under the import policy 1978 79 their import was open to all persons.[94f,c] 3.
the position in regard to the import of dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts) is simple and suffers from no complexity.
dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts) could be imported by all persons under open general licence under the import policy 1978 79.
but under the import policy 1985 88 dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts and dates) are no longer open to import under open general licence.
if dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts and dates) are regarded as items for stock and sale, the import is governed by paragraph 181(3) is chapter xiii of the import policy 1985 88, which declares that import of dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts and dates) will be allowed against licences issued to dealers engaged in this trade.
[94e h] 4.
the diamond exporters cannot be regarded as dealers engaged in the trade of stocking and selling dry fruits (excluding cashewnuts and dates).
they are, therefore, not entitled to the advantage of paragraph 181(3) of the import policy 1985 88.
[95a b] 5.
dry fruits must be regarded as consumer goods of agricultural 90 origin.
the words "agricultural origin" are used in the broadest sense.
dry fruits do not appear in appendix 3 part a and 5 nor can be imported under open general licence under the import policy 1985 88.
in as much as they fall within item (121) of appendix 2 part b they are excluded from the scope of item 1 of appendix 6, and cannot be imported as raw materials and consumables for sale to actual users (industrial).
"consumables" are referred to in item 1 of appendix 6 as goods meant for actual users (industrial) "consumer goods" in item 121 of appendix 2 part b can refer to dry fruits imported for supply to actual users (industrial).[95f h; 96a] 6.
the expression "specifically banned" occurring in the order dated april 18, 1985 of this court determines the range of the items open to import by diamond exporters holding additional licences.
the items excluded from import by diamond exporters under additional licences under the import policy 1985 88 were the items enumerated in appendix 3 and appendix 2 part a of that import policy.
appendix 2 part a is the successor of appendix 4 (list of absolutely banned items) of the import policy 1978 79.
appendix 2 part b (list of restricted items) was also the successor of appendix 4 (list of absolutely banned items).
appendix 4 in the import policy 1978 79 was described as the absolutely banned list.
[96b e] the present appendix 2 part a and appendix 2 part b constitute together what was originally list 4 (list of absolutely banned items) under the import policy 1978 79.
the diamond exporters holding additional licences were, therefore, not entitled to import goods enumerated in appendix 2 part b of the import policy 1985 88.[96f g] 7.
the diamond exporters are not entitled to take advantage of item 121 of appendix 2 part b for the purpose of importing dry fruits.
the holders of additional licences are entitled to import only those goods which are included in appendix 6 part 2 list 8 of the import policy 1985 88.
dry fruits are not included in that list and, therefore, they cannot be imported under additional licences.
they are also not entitled to the benefit extended by the judgment of this court dated march 5, 1986 to those diamond exporters who had imported items under irrevocable letters of credit opened and established before october 18, 1985.
[97b c] 8.
an interim order cannot defeat the fundamental rights of the petitioners merely because it has not been questioned by the customs authorities or the import control authorities.
