the premises of the first appellant were raided by the enforcement directorate and certain records were seized.
the second appellant was the first appellant 's managing director.
thereafter, on 25th august 1967, notice was issued by the respondent to the two appellants to show cause within fourteen days why adjudication proceedings should not be instituted against them under section 23d(1) of the foreign exchange regulation act, 1947, for violation of sections 4 and 9 of the act, on the allegation that 2,44,713.70 swedish kronars had been deposited by them in a bank account in sweden instead of surrendering the foreign exchange to an authorised dealer as required by the act.
after investigation, on 4th november 1967, another notice was issued to the second appellant stating that out of the total sum mentioned, he had acquired, during 1963 to 1965, sw.
88,913.09, that he held the amount in a bank in sweden instead of offering it to the reserve bank of india and thereby contravened sections 4(1) and 9 of the act, and asking him to show if he had any special exemption for acquiring the foreign exchange.
a similar show cause notice was issued to the first appellant in.
respect of the same amount on 20th january 1968.
on 16th march 1968, in supersession of the show cause notice dated 25th august 1967, a further notice was addressed to both the appellants to show cause within 14 days why adjudication proceedings under section 23d of the act should not be held against them in respect of the balance of sw.
1,55,801.41 and added that it had since been decided to launch a prosecution in respect of the sw.
88,913.09 and on the 17th march 1968 a complaint was filed against both the 'appellants in the chief presidency magistrate 's court for contravention of sections 4(1), 5(1)(e) and 9 of the act, punishable under section 23(1)(b) of act, and for violation rule 132a(2) of the defence of india rules, 1962, punishable under rule 132a(4).
thereupon, the appellants fried 'applications in the high court under section 561a, criminal procedure code, for quashing the proceedings in the magistrate 's court, but the applications were dismissed.
in appeal to this court, it was contended that: (1) the punishment under section 23(1)(b) is severer and heavier than the penalty to which a person is made liable if adjudication proceedings are taken under section 23(1)(a), but the section lays down no principles at all for determining when the person concerned should be proceeded against,under section 23(1)(a) and when under section 23(1)(b) and has left it to the arbitrary discretion of the respondent 'and hence violates aft.
14 of constitution; (2) even if section 23(1)(b) is not void the respondent did not act in 'accordance with the 640 requirements of the proviso to section 23d(1)which lays down that a con plaint may be made at any stage of the enquiry, but only if, having regarto the circumstances of the case, the director of enforcement finds the the penalty which 'he is empowered to impose under section 23(1)(a) would not be adequate; and (3) since the notification issued by the ministry of home affairs dated 30th march 1965 provided that r. 132a shall be omitted except 'as respects things done or omitted to be done under that rule, a prosecution in respect of an offence punishable under that rule could not be instituted on 17th march 1968 when that rule had ceased to exist even though it might be in respect of an offence committed earlier during the period that the rule was in force.
held: (1) the choice whether the proceeding be taken under section 23(1)(a) or 23(1)(b) against the person who is liable for action for contravention under section 23(1), is not left entirely to the discretion of the director of enforcement but the criterion for making the choice is indicated in the proviso to section 23d(1).
[648 a b] the foreign exchange regulation (amendment) act, 1957, amended section 23(1) and at the same also, introduced section 23d.
the intention of the legislature from such simultaneous amendment was that the two sections are to be read together.
while providing for alternative proceedings under section 23(1)(a) and section 23(1)(b), the legislature ensured that the procedure laid down in section 23d(1) was to be followed in all cases in which proceedings are intended to be taken under section 23 (1 ).
thus, whenever there is any contravention of any section or rule mentioned in section 23 (1) the director of enforcement must first proceed under the principal clause of section 23d(1) and initiate proceedings for adjudication of penalty.
he cannot at that stage, in his discretion, choose to file a complaint in a court for prosecution of the person concerned for the offence under section 23(1)(b).
though the legislature has not used in either of the sub sections specific words excluding the filing of a complaint before proceedings for adjudication are taken under section 23d(1), it must be presumed that parliament knew that if provision was made for two alternative punishments for the same act, one differing from the other, and without any limitations, such a provision would be void under article 14.
in view of the principle that an interpretation which would save a section should be preferred sections 23(1) and 23d(1) must be interpreted to mean that the director of enforcement must first initiate proceedings under the principal clause of section 23d(1) for adjudication of penalty and that he is empowered to file a complaint in court for the offence under section 23(1)(b) only when at any stage of the adjudication enquiry,, he comes to the opinion that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the penalty which he is empowered to impose would not be: adequate.
[647 d, f h; 648 e h; 649 a c] shanti prasad jain vs the director of enforcement,. ; ;. followed.
(2) when such a safeguard is provided by the legislature it is necessary that the authority, which takes the steps of instituting against that person proceedings, in which, a severer punishment can be awarded, complies strictly with all the conditions laid down by law, that is, the director could file a complaint for prosecution in court only if, having regard to the circumstances of the case, he finds that the. penalty that he is empowered to impose in the adjudication proceedings would not be adequate.
[650 g h] .
in the present case, the enquiry had been instituted by the issue of the show cause notice dated 25th august 1967.
but it does not appear on 641 the record that even after the issue of that notice, any such material came .before the respondent which could be relevant for forming an opinion that the penalty which he. was empowered to impose for the contravention in respect sw.
88,913.09 would not be adequate.
no doubt some investigation was made, but the investigation would not be part of the enquiry which had to be held in accordance with the act and the adjudication proceedings and appeal rules, 1957.
neither of the appellants had shown cause in pursuance of the notice and there was no consideration, of such cause to decide whether adjudication proceedings should be held or not.
nor were any statements taken or recorded during an enquiry under section 23d(1).
whatever statements were recorded were in the course.
of investigation and not in the course of an enquiry under section 23d(1).
therefore, the complaint must be held to have been filed without satisfying the requirements and conditions of the proviso to section 23d(1) of the act, and in .so far as it related to the contravention of the provisions of sections 4(1), 5(1)(e) and 9 of the act, punishable under section 23(1)(b), it must be held invalid.
[651 d e; 652 c d, f g; 653 b d] (3) the language used in the notification of 30th march 1965 only affords protection to action already taken while the rule was in force, but cannot justify initiation of a new proceeding which will not be a thing done or omitted to be done under the rule but, a new act of initiating, a proceeding after the rule had ceased to exist.
the offence alleged against the appellants is in respect of acts done by them which cannot be held to be acts under that rule.
unlike case of wicks vs director of public prosecutions, [1947] a.c. 362, where an express provision was made.
that the operation of the emergency powers (defence) act, 1939 (a temporary act) was not to be affected by its expiry as respects things, previously done or omitted to, be done, in.
the present case, the operation of r. 132a of the defence of india rules has not been continued after its omission.
section 6 of the , also could not be invoked,.
because, the section does not apply to temporary statutes, or rules and omissions.
it only applies to repeals to.
central acts.
further, the notification of the ministry of home affairs omitting r. 132a, did not make any such provision similar to that contained in section 6 of the .
moreover, though section 4(1) of the foreign exchange regulation act was amended simultaneously with the omission of the r. 132a, the legislature did not make any provision that an offence previously committed, under r. 132a would continue to remain punishable as an offence of contravention of section 4(1) of the act nor was any provision made permitting operation of r. 132a itself to permit institution of prosecutions in respect of such offences.
consequently, after the omission of r. 132a the complaint is, incompetent even in respect of the offence under rule 132a(4).
