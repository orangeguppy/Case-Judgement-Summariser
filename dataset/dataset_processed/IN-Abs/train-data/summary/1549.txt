consequent upon the notification under the estates abolition act, the impartible estate of venkatagiri vested in the government and on claims made under section 41 of the act, the tribunal determined advance compensation to the various persons interested.
on appeal against the decision of the tribunal it was contended, that (1) the impartible character of the estate ceased when the estate vested in the government; (2) the compensation did not bear the character of impartibility as it became the property of the joint family ; (3) section 45 was a law altering the rights of distribution of property among the members of a joint family and wag beyond the legislative competence of the state legislature ; (4) the law was discriminatory ; (5) the appellants were not maintenance holders but creditors; (6) the amount of "paishkush" payable to the government ought not to have been deducted from the compensation in calculating the amounts payable to the appellants, as the holder of the estate alone was liable to pay it.
held, that the first question was raised directly in another proceeding and it was not necessary to decide it in these proceedings which were only in respect of advance compensation.
held, further, that in respect of such compensation the proportion of distribution could only be, in accordance with the provisions of sub section 2 of section 45 of the act by which alone the appellants were entitled to claim advance compensation.
281 (2)that the legislation was not one in respect of wills, intestacy and succession, under entry 7, list 3, but under entry 9 of list 2 of the seventh schedule of the constitution.
(3)that in so far as the legislation came within article 31 (b) of the constitution it was not open to attack as offending article 14 of the constitution.
(4)the appellants were maintenance holders howsoever they had been described in the earlier documents and that the earlier documents did not constitute them as creditors of the holders of the estate.
(5)the distributable compensation could only be arrived at afterdeducting the liabilities mentioned in the proviso to section 41 (1) due from the estate to government from the amount of compensation for the estate and that section 54 (a) (ii) required that half of those liabilities (including peshkash) due to the government be deducted from half the amount of compensation which was to be distributed under section 54a (i).
held, further, that in the other appeal proportion of 1/5th fixed by section 45 had been rightly applied and that the contention that the proportion should have been that which the allowances in the earlier documents bore to the total income in the year 1889, was not tenable.
