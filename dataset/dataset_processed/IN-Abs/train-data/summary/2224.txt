the assessee firm consisted of two partners who were managers of their respective hindu undivided families.
the firm sold its goods to the aforesaid families and the families again sold the goods on their own account.
in income tax proceedings for the years 1959 60, 1960 61 and 1961 62 the firm and the hindu undivided families were separately assessed in respect of their incomes.
subsequently the income tax authorities took view that the sale of goods by the firm to the families was only a device to divert the profits of the firm and on this view issued notices under section 147 of the incometax act, 1961 requiring the assessee to show cause why the assessments for the years 1959 60, 1960 61 and 1961 62 should not be reopened.
the high court of gujarat in a petition for a writ under article 226 of the constitution quashed those notices and restrained the income tax officer from taking proceedings in pursuance thereof.
with special leave granted by this court, the revenue appealed.
held:(i) the high court may issue a high prerogative writ prohibiting the income tax officer from proceeding with reassessment when it appears that the income tax officer had no jurisdiction to commence proceedings because the conditions precedent do not exist.
