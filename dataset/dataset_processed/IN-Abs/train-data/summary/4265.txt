[370 h 371 a] b. (i) under the constitutional system courts are havens of refuge for the toiler, not the exploiter, for the weaker claimant of social justice, not the stronger pretender who seeks to sustain the status quo ante by judicial writ in the name of fundamental rights.
[367 e] 367 (2) no higher duty or more solemn responsibility rests upon this court a than to uphold every state measure that translates into living law the preambular promise of social justice reiterated in article 38 of the constitution.
[f] (3) the success of well meant statutory schemes depends on the symbiosis of legislative embargo on exploitative working conditions and viable facilities or acceptable alternatives whereby shackles are shaken off and self ownership substituted.
judicial engineering to wards this goal is better social justice than dehumanised adjudication on the vires of legislation.
