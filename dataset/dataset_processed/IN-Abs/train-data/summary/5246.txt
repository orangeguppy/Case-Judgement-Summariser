an assessment order was passed in respect of the turn over of the appellant firm for the year 1975 76 by the sales tax officer on 7.2.1979.
thereafter, the sales tax officer issued a notice under s.21 of the uttar pradesh sales tax act, 1948, proposing to make a reassessment on the ground that the mandi cess and arhat (commission) had escaped assessment and directed the appellant to appear along with its account books on 18.1.
the sales tax officer passed the order under s.21 on the same date holding that the appellant was not liable to pay any more tax.
in the year 1982 the appellant filed four applications under s.22 for rectification of the mistakes in the assess ment orders for assessment years 1975 76, 1976 77, 1977 78 and 1978 79 on the ground that the turnover in respect of purchases made on behalf of ex u.p. principals had been wrongly assessed to sales tax.
all the four applications were rejected by the sales tax officer on merits.
the appellant preferred appeals and the appellate au thority allowed the appeals relating to the assessment orders for the assessment years 1976 77, 1977 78 and 1978 79 on merits but dismissed the appeal in respect of the assess ment order for the assessment year 1975 76 on the ground that the application for rectification had been filed beyond three years from the date of the original order of assess ment and was thus barred by limitation.
the appellant filed second appeal before the sales tax tribunal in respect of the assessment year 1975 76.
the department also preferred second appeals in respect of the orders of assessment for assessment years 1976 77, 1977 78 and 1978 79.
the tribunal allowed the appeal 141 of the appellant holding that the rectification application made in respect of the assessment order for the assessment year 1975 76 was within limitation as the original order dated 7.2.1979 had ceased to exist on the re opening of the assessment and the final order had been passed on 18.1.
1980 within three years from the date of the application for rectification which had been filed on 4.11.1982.
however, the appeals of the department were dismissed.
out of the four revision applications filed by the department, the high court dismissed three applications and allowed the revision application in respect of the applica tion for rectification of the assessment order for the assessment year 1975 76 holding that the application for rectification had been filed beyond three years from the date of the original order dated 7.2.
1979 and that the order dated 18.
1. 1980 had no effect on the question of limitation.
in the appeal to this court, on behalf of the appellant it was contended that on the issue of the notice under s.21 of the act original assessment order ceased to be in force and that the only order of assessment in respect of assess ment year 1975 76 which should be taken into consideration for all purposes including the application for rectification of mistake is the order dated 18.1.
on behalf of the state it was contended that since no order of reassessment had actually been passed in the in stant case on 18.1.
1980 but only an order discharging the notice issued under s.21 of the act had been passed the original order of assessment passed on 7.2.
1979 continued to remain in force.
allowing the appeal, held: 1.
the judgment of the high court is set aside and the decision of the tribunal restored.
[150g] 2.
section 21 of the uttar pradesh sales tax act, 1948, authorises the assessing authority to make an order of assessment or reassessment.
it says that if the assessing authority has reason to believe that the whole or any part of the turnover of a dealer, for any assessment year or part thereof, has escaped assessment to tax or has been under assessed or has been assessed to tax at a rate lower than that at which it is assessable under the act, or any deduc tions or exemptions have been wrongly allowed in respect thereof, the assessing authority may, after issuing notice to the dealer and making such inquiry as it may consider neces 142 sary assess or reassess the dealer or tax according to law.
[149g h;150a b] 3.
section 21 of the act does not require the assessing authority to pass an order deciding whether it is necessary to proceed with the inquiry under that section or not before passing an order of assessment or reassessment under that section.
the only order which the assessing authority is required to make under s.21 after a notice is issued to the dealer under that section is an order of assessment or reassessment.
[150c d] 4.
once a notice is issued for ,purposes of making reassessment the earlier proceedings become re opened and the initial order of assessment ceases to be operative.
the effect of the re opening of the assessment is to vacate or set aside the initial order of assessment and to substitute in its place the order mode on reassessment and that the result of the re opening of the assessment is that a fresh order for reassessment would have to he made in respect of all matters including those matters in respect of which there is no allegation of the turnover escaping assessment.
[148h;149a b] 5.
once an assessment order hod been rectified and it was sought to make a further rectification of that order the period of limitation for making such further rectification would commence not from the date of the original assessment order but from the date of the earlier rectification order.

the order dated 18.1.
1980 is an order of reassess ment notwithstanding the fact that a regular order of reas sessment has not been passed.
the order passed on 18.1.
1980 should be construed as a fresh order of assessment passed under s.21 of the act and the initial order of assessment dated 7.2.1979 should be deemed to be the order passed again on 18.1.1980.

if the assessee is able to show any error apparent on the record from the order of assessment dated 7.2.
1979 the appellant is entitled to 143 succeed in its application for rectification provided it is made within the prescribed time, i.e., three years from the date of the order passed under s.21 of the act.
[149e f] deputy commissioner of commercial taxes vs h.r. sri ramulu, ; , referred to.
it should be held that the assessing authority had adopted the earlier order dated 7.2.1979 as the order of assessment passed at the conclusion of the proceedings under s.21 of the act.
the period of limitation for the applica tion for rectification should, therefore, be calculated from the date of the order under s.21 of the act, i.e. 18.1.1980.
