the firsf petition is on behalf of one thousand dairy mates and the other on behalf of 280 workers as junior plant operatives and semiskilled operatives.
the grievance of dairy mates is that although they perform the duties of semi skilled workers they have been wrongly classified as unskilled workers and paid salaries as such.
similarly the grievance of the junior plant operatives and semi skilled operatives is that they are actually doing the work of skilled workers but are classified as unskilled workers and paid salary as such.
in view of the disputed questions relating to the nature and functions of the workmen involved, the court referred the matter to the central govt.
industrial tribunal cum labour court to report to the court as to what would be appropriate pay scales admissible to the concerned workers.
on the basis of additional material and evidence produced by the workers, the tribunal made its report and recommended that taking into consideration all the facts and circum stances, the mates and jpos may be given the pay scale of rs.800 1150, the semi skilled operatives may be given the scale of rs.825 1200 and the skilled operatives may be given the scale of rs.950 1400.
the union of india criticised the pay scale recommended to the mates contending that their work was of unskilled nature.
accepting the report of the tribunal while allowing the petitions in terms of the re port, this court, held: there is no roster of duties and functions of the mates in any unit and all mates have to do the work of the units to which they are assigned on any particular day.
the mates have thus to be versatile with the work in all the units, both unskilled and semi skilled.
this is certainly not the case with the sweepers, chowkidars and malls who are categorised as unskilled workers.
this being the case, there is no merit in the contention of the union of india that the mates should be 324 treated on par with the unskilled workers.
