the plaintiff appellant filed a suit alleging that the lands in suit were unauthorisedly transferred to the predecessors in title 121 948 of the respondents.
his contention was that the lands were granted to the bardeuries (officials) of a certain ancient temple in assam in order to enable them to render service to the deities installed in the temple and as such the lands were inalienable to strangers other than the bardeuries.
held, that in view of the history of land tenure in assam and by virtue of the relevant statutory provisions of assam land and revenue regulation (reg. 1 of 1886) the lands must.
be deemed to be heritable and transferable without any restriction.
the transferor bardeuries, who held the lands described as brahmottar lands in revenue records, fell under section 8(1)(a) and became " land holders " under section 3(g) of the regulation and consequently section 9 applied to them statutorily recognising their rights in the lands to be permanent, heritable and transferable.
to prove the plaintiff appellant 's contention that the lands could be alienated only to a specified class of persons, the onus was on the appellant and not on the respondents to prove the contrary.
