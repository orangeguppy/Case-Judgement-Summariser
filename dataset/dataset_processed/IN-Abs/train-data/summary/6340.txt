the appellants were convicted by the additional sessions judge on three counts and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and a fine of rs.200 under sections 148, 323/149 and 302/149 i.p.c.
the appellants preferred an appeal against the order of conviction and sentence.
dis missing the appeal, the high court, clarified that their convictions were on six counts and altered the fine awarded under section 302/149 i.p.c. from rs.200 to rs.5,000 in respect of each appellant per count, i.e. rs.30,000 per appellant.
hence the appellants preferred appeal, by special leave, in this court, limited to the question of enhancement of fine only.
allowing the appeal, and setting aside the order of high court enhancing the fine, this court, held: it is clear from a conjoint reading of sections 377, 386, 397 and 401 of code of criminal procedure, 1973, that if the state government is aggrieved about the inade quacy of the sentence, it can prefer an appeal under section 377(1) of the code.
the failure on the part of the state government to prefer an appeal does not, however, preclude the high court from exercising suo motu power of revision under section 397 read with section 401 of the code, since the high court itself is empowered to call for the record of the proceeding of any court subordinate to it.
but before the high court can exercise its revisional jurisdiction to enhance the sentence, it is imperative that the convict is put on notice and given an opportunity of being heard on the question of sentence either in person or through his advo cate.
the revisional jurisdiction cannot be exercised to the prejudice of the convict without putting him on guard that it is proposed to enhance the sentence imposed by the trial court.
[515a d] 513 in the present case, the appeal was filed under section 374(2) of the code by the convicts against the order passed by the additional sessions judge.
no appeal was filed by the state under section 377(1) of the code against the sentence awarded by the trial court for the offence under section 302/149, i.p.c. on the ground of its inadequacy.
nor did the high court exercise suo motu revisional powers under section 397 read with section 401 of the code.
if the high court was minded to enhance the sentence the proper course was to exercise suo motu powers under section 397 read with section 401 of the code by issuing notice of enhancement and hearing the convicts on the question of inadequacy of sentence.
without following such procedure it was not open to the high court in the appeal filed by the convicts to enhance the sentence by enhancing the fine.
the high court clearly acted without jurisdiction.
