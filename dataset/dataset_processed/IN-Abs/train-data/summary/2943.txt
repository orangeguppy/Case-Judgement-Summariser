the appellant was appointed in 1942 as labour supervisor, army ordnance corps.
in 1951, pending inquiry into certain charges against him his service was terminated by giving him one month 's notice under rule 5 of the civilians in defence services (temporary service) rules, 1949.
he challenged the legality of the order of termination on the grounds that it had been passed by an officer subordinate to the authority who appointed him and that no adequate opportunity had been afforded to him of defending himself.
he also alleged that the order was vitiated by mala fides.
in the appellant 's appeal against the dismissal of his suit the high court held that article 311 of the constitution was inapplicable, that breach of the rules did not give an aggrieved party a right to go to the court and that the order was not vitiated by mala fides.
dismissing the appeal to this court.
held : the appellant, holding a post connected with defence cannot claim the protection of article 311 of the constitution.
