certain plots of land of the appellant were acquired by notifications dated 12.1.1978, 27.7.1978 and 14.6.1979 issued under s.4(1) of the land acquisition act, 1894.
the land acquisition officer by an order dated 10.6.1982 fixed the market value at rs. 42,000 per acre with 5 per cent deduction towards development cost.
in appellant 's appeal the civil court fixed the market value at rs.200 per sq. yard with a deduction of 5 per cent towards the development charges.
on the appeal by the land acquisition officer, the high court reassessed the entire evidence and fixed the market value at rs.3 lakh per acre holding that if a deduction of 20 per cent was allowed, the market value would come to rs.2,40,000 per acre which worked out at rs.50 per sq.yard, and accordingly set aside the judgment and decree, and determined the market value at rs.50 per sq.yard.
dismissing the appeals of the appellant claimant this court, held: 1.
in fixing the compensation, the high court did not go by the percentage of deduction but kept in view the market value of the land at the time of the notification under s.4(1) of the land acquisition act, 1894.
[p. 377 f] 2.
there was clear material and the high court accepted it that price went up in the area after 1980.
the notifica tions were within a range of a year or two from that time.
therefore, the valuation after 1980 was not the guideline.
[ p. 377 f g] 376 3.
in the instant case, the collector had adopted a deduction of five per cent.
the referee court adopted the deduction at 20 per cent and the high court rejecting the claim of the advocate general that deduction should be one third put it at one fifth.
the high court did not go by the percentage of deduction.
the appropriate market value fixed by the high court per sq.
yard was rs 50 and if a 20 per cent deduction from out of rs.3 lakhs per acre was accepted, it worked that way.
the finding of the high court need not be disturbed.
