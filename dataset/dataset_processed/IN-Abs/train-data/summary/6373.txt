the appellant and two others were convicted for life and 3 years rigorous imprisonment or fine of rs.2500 each for offences under section 302 read with section 34 ipc and section 201 read with section 34 ipc, respectively.
on appeal by the accused the high court set aside the convic tion of all of them under section 302 read with section 34 ipc, and also the conviction of two of them under section 201 read with section 34 ipc.
in respect of the appellant the high court not only confirmed the conviction under section 201, but also enhanced the sentence to 7 years rigorous imprisonment.
while doing so, the high court did not issue notice to the appellant; nor did it afford an opportunity of showing cause against the proposed enhance ment of sentence.
before the high court, the state did not prefer an appeal for an enhancement of sentence under sec tion 377 cr.
p.c. on the ground of inadequacy.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.1. 'let punishment fit the crime ' is one of the main objects of the sentencing policy.
to achieve this object, the code of criminal procedure empowers the high court to enhance the sentence in appropriate cases while the sentence awarded by the subordinate courts is grossly inade quate or unconscionably lenient or 'flea bite ' or is not commensurate with the gravity of the offence.
the high court enjoins the power of enhancing the sentence either in exer cise of its revisional jurisdiction under section 397 read with section 401 or in its appellate jurisdiction under section 377 read with section 386(c) of the criminal proce dure code subject to the provisos (1) and (2) to section 386 of the code.
it is permissible for the high court while exercising its revisional jurisdiction under section 397 read with section 401 ipc to exercise the power of a court of appeal under section 386(c) for enhancement of sentence.
[857g h; 858a] 856 1.2.
the high court, notwithstanding its powers under the appellate jurisdiction in an appeal preferred under section 377 of the code, have powers to act suo motu to enhance the sentence in appropriate cases while exercising its revisional jurisdiction even in the absence of an appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence as provided under section 377.

the high court both in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under section 397 read with section 401 cr.
p.c. and its appellate jurisdiction under section 377 read with section 386(c) of cr.
p.c. in matters of enhancement of sentence should give the accused a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement as contemplated under the first proviso to section 386 as well under sub section (3) of section 377 of the code.
the rules of natural justice as also the prescribed procedure require issuing notice to the appellant and affording an opportunity to be heard on the proposed action for enhancement of sentence.

in the instant case, the high court has enhanced the sentence unmindful of the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure and also the rules of natural justice and by over stepping its jurisdiction adopted a leeway in en hancing the sentence from three years to seven years for the conviction under section 201 ipc which exercise of powers in violation of the prescribed procedure, is impermissible. ]861c d]
