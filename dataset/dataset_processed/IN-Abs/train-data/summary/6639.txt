the company respondent no. 3 entered into a contract of lease with the state government for a period of one year and later it was extended for a further period of ten years.
when proceedings were initiated on 16.7.1952 to eject the company, the company filed suit for declaration of title and perpetual injunction.
the trial court holding that the company did not become a `pakka ' tenant under section 54(vii) of part ii of act no. 66 of 1950 in respect of the suit land and that the company was "a government lessee under section 181 of the m.p. land revenue code, 1959, and was not an occupancy tenant under section 185 of the code, dismissed the suit.
this judgment, was affirmed by the high court in first appeal, observing that the land held by the company under the lease was neither zamindari nor ryotwari land.
against that judgment, the company filed an appeal in this court which was withdrawn in 1971.
subsequently, the state entered into an agreement with the company to grant a fresh lease for a period of ten years from 9.2.1971 subject to the payment of enhanced rent as agreed upon between the parities.
since the company failed to pay the agreed rents and contravened the conditions of the lease, proceedings were initiated under section 182(2)(i) of the code, for eviction of the company from the land in question.
175 eviction order was quashed by the high court holding that the lease in question was not covered by section 181 of the code and that the company could not be evicted by the summary proceeding provided for under that section, against which the appeal has been filed.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
a `government lessee ' is defined under the m.p. land revenue code, 1959 as "a person holding land from the state government under section 181".
[178e] 2.
as per the provisions in section 181 of the m.p. land revenue code, 1959 whether or not the company has been holding the land in terms of the original lease or under the newly stipulated terms of the lease, the company has been holding the land from the state government and it has never been an ordinary tenant as defined in the madhya bharat act no. 66 of 1950.
accordingly, whether considered in term of sub section (1) or sub section (2) of section 181, the company has been at all material times a government lessee in respect of the land in question.
[179 g 180 a] 3.
it was in terms of sub section 2(i) of section 182 that the additional collector made his order for eviction of the company.
the finding of the additional collector is a finding of fact based on evidence and is not liable to be questioned in these proceedings.
large amounts are due and payable by the company as rent.
in the circumstances, the additional collector was well justified in having recourse to the proceeding prescribed under section 182 of the code.
