this establishment because of the provisions.
contained in section 16(1)(b) of the act.

(ii) however the acquittal of the respondent must be upheld.
the burden of proving that the old establishment had continued was on the appellant.
the evidence showed: that, at the time of the purchase a new owner came in place of the previous owner; the work of the press was stopped on sale and was restarted after a break of about three 482 months; the machinery in the press was also altered; the persons employed previously were not continued in service, while= a fresh recruitment of employees took place amongst whom only six happened to be previous employees; and compensation was paid to the workmen at the time of the sale.
by the previous owner.
