no doubt the supreme court, in case of gross miscarriage of justice or departure from legal procedure such as vitiates the whole trial, possesses the power and has special jurisdiction to intervene under article 136(1) of this constitution and also if the findings of fact were such as were shocking to judicial conscience; but no high court can arrogate that function to itself because it finds itself helpless to redress the grievance.
certificate granted on mere question of fact would be no certificate at all; high court should refuse such certificates under article 134(1)(c) and should ask the parties to approach the supreme court to invoke its special jurisdiction under article 136(1) of the constitution.
