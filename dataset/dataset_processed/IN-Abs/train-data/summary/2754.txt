the appellant, who was a junior officer in the state service, was appointed as an officiating senior officer on may 10, 1954.
on may 12, 1954, an order was passed reverting him to the, post of junior officer.
on the ground that he refused to obey the order of reversion, on may 6, 1957 he was suspended, and ultimately dismissed.
the orders of the suspension and dismissal were set aside by the court of judicial commissioner.
by order dated november 7.
1960, he was reinstated in the post of the senior officer which he was holding on the date of his suspension.
with effect from the afternoon of may 7, 1957.
by the same order, he was reverted to his substantive post of junior officer with retrospective effect from june, 7, 1957, as another officer was already occupying the post.
the appellant, thereupon, challenged both the orders dated may 12, 1954, and november 7, 1960, but the judicial commissioner dismissed the petition.
in appeal to this court, held : (1) the order dated november 7, 1960 reverting the appellant to his substantive post did not entail forfeiture of the appellant 's pay or allowances, or loss of seniority in his substantive rank, or stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion.
the appellant could not claim the salary of the senior post from the date of suspension or dismissal till date of reinstatement, because, the appropriate authority, when reinstating the appellant could revert him, as from an earlier date, to his substantive post from the officiating post, provided the order was not passed mala fide.
