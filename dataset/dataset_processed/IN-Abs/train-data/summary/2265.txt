before the constitution came into force, the travancore cochin general sales tax act, m.e. 1125, levied a tax on sale of goods and inter state sales were not exempt from such taxation.
by act 12 of 1951, section 26 was inserted in the act to bring the act into line with article 286 of the constitution as it then stood, and imposed a ban on the levy of tax on inter state sales after march 31, 1951, unless parliament otherwise provided under article 286(2).
on september 6, 1955, this court held in the bengal immunity co. ltd. case, [1955]2 s.c.r. 603, that inter state sales could not be taxed by a state, even if they were inside sales with respect to that state.
this led to the passing, by parliament, of the sales tax laws validation act, 1956, for the purpose of validating the levy and collection of taxes on inside sales between april 1, 1951 and september 6, 1955.
in sundararamier & co. case ; this court decided that section 22 of the madras general sales tax act, 1939 which was in part materia with section 26 of the travancore cochin act operated to impose a tax, subject to authorisation by parliament as provided in article 286(2); in other words it was a piece of legislation imposing tax in praesenti but with a condition annexed that it was to come into force in futuro as and when parliament so provided; and this view was re affirmed by this court in the cochin coal co. 's case ; with respect to section 26 of the travancore cochin act.
[418c; 422 b f] the respondent assessee was a dealer, not resident in travancore cochin state.
it supplied coal to consumers within the state, the last of the transactions being on september 4, 1955.
on the question whether the inter state sales during assess ment year 1955 56, were taxable under the provisions of the travancore cochin act, the sales tax appellate tribunal and the high court held in favour of the assessee.
in appeal by the state to this court, held: the ban imposed by section 26 of the travancore cochin act, having been lifted by the sales tax laws validation act, sales tax could be levied and collected by the state for the period covered by that act.
the amendment to the section by kerala act 12 of 1957 did not fall to be considered in the present case inasmuch as the amending act was only prospective and did not operate to invalidate any levy of tax imposed before.
the question as to whether the state of kerala had legislative competence to amend section 26 by kerala act 9 of 1962 which purported to validate, the levy and collection of taxes before september 6, 1955 is also irrelevant for the purpose of this appeal.
