the roadside station masters of the central railway challenged the constitutionality of promotion for guards to higher grade station masters ' posts.
the petitioners contended that the channel of promotions amounted to a denial of equal opportunity as between roadside station masters and guards in the matter of promotion and thus contravened the provisions of article 16(1) of the constitution, as taking advantage of this channel of promo tions, guards become station masters at a very much younger age than roadside station masters and thus block the chances of higher promotion to roadside station masters who reach the scale when they are much older.
the appellant contended that roadside station masters and guards really formed one and the same class of employees.
held, that the roadside station masters belong to a wholly distinct and separate class from guards and so there can be no question of equality of opportunity in matter of promotion as between the roadside station masters and guards.
the question of denial of equal opportunity requires serious consideration only as between the members of the same class.
the concept of equal opportunity in matters of employment, does not apply to variations in provisions as between members of different classes of employees under the state.
equality of opportunity in matters of employment can be predicated only 312 between persons who are either seeking the same employment, or have obtained the same employment.
equality of opportunity in matters of promotion, must mean equality as between members of the same class of employee and not equality between members of separate, independent classes.
the fact that the qualifications necessary for recruitment of one post and another are approximately or even wholly the same can in no way affect the question whether they form one and the same class, or form different classes.
