dismissing the appeal, ^ held: section 499(1) of the cr.
p.c., which contemplated the execution of a bond by the accused and by the sureties, did not imply that a single bond was to be executed by both the accused and the sureties, signed by the accused and counter signed by the sureties.
an undertaking of the surety in form 42, schedule v to secure the attendance of the accused was quite independent of the undertaking given by the accused to appear before the court whenever called upon, even if both the undertakings of the surety and the accused happened to be executed in the same document for the sake of convenience.
each under taking being distinct can be separately enforced.
[450 c, 451 b d] the fact that an accused would not be released on bail without his executing a personal bond does not mean that if a person is released by mistake without his executing a personal bond, the sureties are absolved from securing the attendance of the accused and his appearance before the court.
the sureties ' responsibility arises from the exeeution of the surety bond and is not contingent upon execution of a personal bond by the accused.
nor is the liability to forfeiture of the bond executed by the surety contingent upon the execution and the liability to forfeiture of the personal bond executed by the accused.
the forfeiture of the personal bond of the accused is not a condition precedent to the forfeiture of the bonds executed by the sureties.
