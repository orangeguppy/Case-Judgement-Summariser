in these appeals on the question: whether section 15 (as amended) of the rajasthan imposition of ceiling on agricul tural holdings act, 1973 was violative of article 14 of the constitution of india.
dismissing the appeals, this court, held: rajasthan imposition of ceiling on agricultural holdings act, 1973 was a legislation which was made for the purpose of bringing about agrarian reforms.
the provisions of the act including section 15 (as amended) are protected by article 31(a)(1)(a) of the constitution.
therefore, the attack that section 15 of the act was violative of article 14 of the constitution does not survive.
the high court was right in upholding the validity of section 15 of the act.
