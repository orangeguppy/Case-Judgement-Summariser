the appellants as well as the respondents are members of the uttar pradesh higher judicial service; while the appellants are the promotees, the respondents have been appointed direct to that service.
this is their second round of litigation in this court concerning their inter se seniority in the service.
the higher judicial service was initially governed by statutory rules called the uttar pradesh higher judicial service rules, 1953.
recruitment to the service under the said rules was from sources, by promotion and by direct recruitment.
this court in chandra mohan vs state of uttar pradesh, struck down the 1953 rules in so far as the said rules provided for direct recruitment of the service.
as a consequence, there was no direct recruitment to the service till 1975 76, and the service consisted of only promotees with the designation of civil and sessions judges.
on may 8, 1974 the uttar pradesh higher judicial service (abolition of cadre of the civil and sessions judges) rules, 1974 came into force.
under rules 2 and 3 of the 1974 rules, the existing cadre of civil and sessions judges stood abolished and a new cadre of additional district and sessions judges came into existence, the civil and sessions judges holding permanent or temporary posts in the service were re designated as additional district and sessions judges with effect from the date when the 1974 rules came into force.
on that date, 271 officers were working as additional district and sessions judges against 235 posts (153 permanent and 82 temporary) in the service.
the service was reconstituted and given a fresh look by the rules framed under article 309 read with article 233 of the constitution of india, called the uttar pradesh higher judicial service rules, 1975 which came into force on april 5, 1975.
on that date 263 officers were 425 working as additional district and sessions judges, against 236 posts in the service.
recruitment to the service under the 1975 rules is from three sources and is based on quota as provided therein.
the three sources of recruitment are (i) direct recruitment from the bar, (ii) uttar pradesh nyayik sewa, and (iii) uttar pradesh judicial service (judicial magistrates).
in the first round of litigation p.k. dixit and other promotee officers filed two writ petitions under article 32 of the constitution challenging the seniority assigned to them under the 1975 rules.
this court by its judgment dated october 8, 1987 in p.k. dixit vs state of u.p., ; partly allowed the writ petitions and directed the high court to frame the seniority list afresh keeping in view the observations made in that judgment.
in pursuance to the directions of this court in dixit case a five judge committee of the high court finalised the seniority list on august 25, 1988.
the high court accepted the contention of direct recruits and gave 153 permanent posts existing on may 10, 1974 plus 31 posts, which became permanent subsequently, to the promotees.
consequently, out of the 263 additional district and sessions judges who were holding the posts on april 5, 1975 only 84 (153 + 31) were taken to be the existing members of the service and the remaining officers were asked to enter the service through the promotion quota under the 1975 rules.
in the second round, the promotees have filed writ petition challenging the final seniority list.
p.k. dixit and others, petitioners in the original dixit case have filed civil miscellaneous petition seeking clarification of the said judgment.
the direct recruits have filed writ petition under article 32 impugning the final seniority list issued by the high court.
before this court, the promotees, the direct recruits as well as the high court have sought support from dixit case on the basis of their own interpretation of that judgment.
the promotees claim that on april 5, 1975 when the 1975 rules came into force all the 236 posts in the service had already been consumed by the existing members of the service who were working as additional district and sessions judges; till that date the recruitment to the service was only by way of promotion and as such there was no question of allocating any post to the direct recruits who had not yet been born in the service.
426 on the other, hand, the direct recruits contend that this court interpreting the second proviso to rule 8(2) of the 1975 rules in dixit case had held that the promotees as on may 10, 1974 are entitled to all the permanent posts available on that date plus 31 temporary posts, and apart from that they cannot lay claim exclusively to the posts created thereafter.
in this connection it was contended that temporary posts could not form part of the cadre of the service, and service rendered in or against a temporary post was outside the pale of the 1975 rules and could not be counted for seniority and as much the continuous officiation immediately prior to the date of confirmation provided in the first proviso to rule 26(1)(a) of the 1975 rules could only be the officiation against a permanent post.
allowing the writ petition and the civil miscellaneous petition, quashing the seniority list and directing the high court to prepare fresh seniority list, this court, held: (1) the interpretation given by the high court to the second proviso to rule 8(2) of the 1975 rules is not correct.
the proviso was not applicable to the service as reconstituted under the 1974 rules consisting of additional district and sessions judges.
proviso 2 was enacted to meet a particular situation.
the proviso was meant to deal with a situation which might have arisen in the event there had been more posts and less number of officers to occupy the said posts on the reconstitution of the service under the 1974 rules.
but since the number of officers working in the service as on may 10, 1974 and april 5, 1975 was much more than the posts available in the service the situation envisaged by the proviso did not arise.
the second proviso to rule 8(2) of the 1975 rules could not operate and since it was intended to meet one time eventuality it has become redundant.
[440d 441c] (2) the service as constituted under the 1974 rules continued to operate till april 5, 1975 when the 1975 rules were enforced.
on april 5, 1975 the service comprised of 236 posts (229 permanent plus 7 temporary)> there were 263 officers working in the service on that date.
the 236 posts comprising the service on april 5, 1975 have to be assigned and given to the 236 officers out of 263 who were working as additional district and sessions judges and they are to be treated as existing member of the service as no april 5, 1975.
it is further axiomatic that the 236 officers including those holding temporary posts would en bloc rank senior to all those who were appointed to the service after april 5, 1975, under the 1975 rules.
[439h 440c] 427 (3) the additional district and sessions judges had not only the right to be appointed to the service but they were so appointed by the operation of 1974 rules.
the second proviso to rule 8(2) even though retrospective could not have taken away the vested rights of the officers who had already become members of the service.
this could not be the intention of the farmers of the 1975 rules.
[441d] (4) the substantive vacancy has not been defined under the 1975 rules but there can also be a substantive vacancy in a temporary post which is part of the cadre.
all temporary posts created under rule 4(4) of the 1975 rules are additions to the permanent strength of the cadre and as such form part of the cadre.
[442f] (5) appointments under rule 22 of the 1975 rules can be made to a permanent post as well as to a temporary post.
so long as the temporary post has an independent existence and is a part of the cadre strength the appointment.
[442g] (6) recruitment to the service under the 1975 rules is from three sources and is based on quota as provided therein.
the cadre consists of permanent as well as temporary posts.
the seniority of the direct recruit is to be determined from the date of his joining the service and that of promotee on the basis of continuous officiation/service from the date when a vacancy whether permanent or temporary, becomes available in his quota.
with these characteristics of the service it is obligatory that there should be equality of opportunity to enter the service for all the three sources of recruitment.
if the recruitment rule gives unjustifiable preference to one source of recruitment the seniority rule is bound to become unworkable.
[444e f] (7) when temporary posts under rule 4(4) of the 1975 rules are created as addition to the cadre there is no justification in not applying the quota rule to the temporary posts in the service and confining appointments to said posts in the service to the two sources of promotees.
[448e] a.k. subraman vs union of india, referred to.
(8) there is no justification whatsoever in having rules 22(3) and 22(4) of the 1975 rules which deprive one of the sources of recruitment the benefit of appointment to the temporary posts.
the rules on the face 428 of it are discriminatory.
there is no nexus with the object sought to be achieved by framing these rules.
[448g h] (9) rules 22(3) and 22(4) of the 1975 rules are discriminatory and violative of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution and are accordingly struck down.
however, the appointments already made under these rules 22(3) and 22(4) shall not be invalidated on this ground.
further, while selecting candidates under rule 18 the committee shall prepare a merit list of candidates twice the number of vacancies and the said list shall remain operative till the next recruitment.
further, the appointments under rules 22(1) and 22(2) of the rules shall be made to permanent as well as temporary posts from all the three sources in accordance with the quota provided under the 1975 rules.
[449h 450b] (10) the findings and observations in dixit case to the extent those are contrary to this judgment shall be deemed to have been over ruled.
