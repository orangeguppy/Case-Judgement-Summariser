in a surety bond the sureties bound themselves for payment of rs. 50,000 "only in case mr. ali khan fails. . to surrender to the deputy commissioner of singhbhum within three, days of the receipt of the notice of the order or judgment of the judicial committee if by the said order or judgment the sentence is upheld either partly or wholly".
as a result of the constitutional changes the jurisdiction of the privy council came to be transferred to the federal court, and eventually ali khan 's appeal to the privy council was heard and dismissed by the federal court.
thereupon the deputy commissioner issued notice to the sureties to produce ali khan within three days.
held, that the proceedings taken against the sureties were entirely misconceived as the penalty stipulated had not been incurred, in view of the terms of the bond set out above.
provisions in a surety bond which are penal in nature must be very strictly construed and there is no room for the application of a legal fiction that the judgment of the federal court must be deemed to be the judgment or order contemplated by the parties to the surety bond.
