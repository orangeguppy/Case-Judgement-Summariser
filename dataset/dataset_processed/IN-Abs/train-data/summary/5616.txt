% a trust with the settler, her son and two others, as trustees was created.
part of the trust property included a large house.
respondents in criminal appeal no. 658 of 1986, were employed as secretary and manager of the trust between 1976 and june, 1981.
on a complaint filed in the court of the metropolitan magistrate by one of the trustees alleging that these two officers, in conspiracy with one of the trustees, son of the settler, and his wife, had created documents showing tenancy in respect of a flat of the large house, forming part of the trust property, in favour of the aforesaid trustee 's wife, summons were directed to be issued against the aforesaid four accused for offences punishable under sections 406 and 467 read with section 34 and 120b of the ipc.
the accused persons challenged the proceedings before the high court which quashed the proceedings against two of the accused, but sustained the order of the magistrate against the other two accused, appellants in civil appeal no. 657 of 1986.
931 appeals against the aforesaid order were filed in this court both by the two accused, whose prosecution was not quashed, as also the complainant.
on behalf of the accused appellants, it was contended that the trust deed authorised the trustee to look after the affairs of the trust, but the tenancy in favour of the trustee 's wife could not be considered as creating an interest in favour of the trustee as the wife was an independent person having her own income, that there was no mens rea involved for initiating criminal proceedings and, at the most it amounted to a civil wrong, and that the court machinery should not be permitted to be utilised for private vengeance as the mother and the son had fallen out.
on behalf of the complainant it was urged that in view of section 53 of the , it was a clear case of breach of trust and that every breach of trust would simultaneously be a civil wrong and a criminal offence, and an opportunity should be given to the complainant to establish his case by leading evidence, and that no objection could be taken at the preliminary stage.
allowing the appeal of the accused and dismissing the appeal of the complainant, the court, ^ held: when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations, as made, prima facie establish the offence.
it is also for the court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue.
this is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage.
[934g h; 935a] a case of breach of trust may be both a civil wrong and criminal offence.
but there would be certain situations where it would predominantly be a civil wrong and may or may not amount to criminal offence.
the instant case is one of that type where, if at all, the facts may constitute a civil wrong and the ingredients of the criminal offence are wanting.
[935b c] 932 having regard to the relevant documents, including the trust deed and the correspondence following the creation of the tenancy and taking into consideration the natural relationship between the settler and the son and his wife and the fall out and the fact that the trustee 's wife does not claim any interest in the tenancy, the criminal case should not be continued.
the criminal proceedings against the appellants accused are quashed.
