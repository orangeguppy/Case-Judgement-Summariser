exercising power under section 29(1) of the bombay reorganisation act the president had determined that the appellant who then was an additional judge of the bombay high court should cease to be a judge of that high court and become a judge of the newly formed high court of gujarat.
in his petition under article 226 of the constitution the appellant claimed that the source of power to transfer a judge from one high court to another being in article 222 read with article 217(1) (c) of the constitution the impugned order though purporting to have been passed under section 29(1) of the bombay reorganisation act, amounted to an order of transfer of a judge and therefore, he was entitled to the compensatory allowance contemplated by article 222(2).
a single judge of the high court held that the order passed under section 29 was an order of allocation of judges of the erstwhile high court of bombay to the two new high courts and that such allocation did not amount to transfer.
on appeal a division bench held that the transfer envisaged by article 222 was a transfer in a situation when a judge of one high court was sent to another existing high court for reasons which had nothing to do with the bifurcation or reorganisation of a state and the setting up of a new high court while section 29 was part of the provisions which were supplemental, incidental or consequential to the formation of the state of gujarat.
dismissing the appeal ^ held: the entitlement to compensatory allowance under article 222(2) is conditional upon the judge being "so transferred", that is, transferred as envisaged by article 222(1).
since the appellant was "allotted" to the gujarat high court on the setting up of that court, he was not entitled to claim the compensatory allowance.
[617 d] articles 3 and 4 of the constitution deal with a special situation and so long as a provision of law promulgated by parliament can be considered as supplemental, incidental or consequential to the formation of a new state it would be enforceable even though it might amount to an amendment of certain provisions of the constitution.
the provision contained in section 29 of the act is clearly consequential to the formation of the state of gujarat and establishment of a high court for it.
it was for the purpose of setting up that high court that judges then serving in the bombay high court were so 614 to say allotted to the high court of gujarat and although their appointment to the gujarat high court may partake of some of the characteristics of a transfer, they cannot be said to have been transferred from the bombay high court to the gujarat high court within the meaning of article 222(1) of the constitution.
