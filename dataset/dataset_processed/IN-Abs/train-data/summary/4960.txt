in the instant case, it has not been shown that the appellant had filed the suit for mandatory injunction after considerable delay which will disentitle him to the discretionary relief.

the suit is in effect one for possession though couched in the form of a suit for mandatory injunction as what would be given to the plaintiff in case he succeeds in possession of the property to which he may found to be entitled.

the respondent was a licensee and he must be deemed to be always a licensee.
it is not open to him, during the subsistence of the licence or in the licence or in the suit for recovery of possession of the property instituted after revocation of the licence to set up title to the property in himself or anyone else.
it is his plain duty to surrender possession of the property as a licensee and seek his remedy separately in case he has acquired title to the property subsequently through some other person.
he need not do so if he has acquired title to the property from the licensor or from some one else lawfully claiming under him, in which case there would be clear merger.
the respondent had not surrendered the possession of the property to the appellant even after the termination of the licence and the institution of the suit.
the appellant is, therefore, entitled to recover possession of the property.
the respondent is directed to deliver possession of the property to the appellant forthwith failing which it will be open to the appellant to execute the decree and obtain possession.
