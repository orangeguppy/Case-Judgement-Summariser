need not be preceded by the termination of the contract.
dismissing the appeal, ^ held: 1 it is clear that in the absence of a statutory exclusion of natural justice any exercise of power prejudicially affecting another must be in conformity with the rules of natural justice.
in the present case.
we are satisfied 771 that there is no foundation for the grievance of the appellant on the score of natural justice since an opportunity was afforded to the appellant before finally quantifying the penalty to be levied but the appellant did not avail himself of the opportunity.
[773 e f] 2.
on a true construction of rule 29 once a forest authority detects a breach it must investigate the extent and estimate, the nature and degree of damage caused by the breach, if it is serious they must proceed to ascertain the sum to be fixed as penalty.
in doing this, a reasonable opportunity must be given to the affected party.
after that, the penalty shall be quantified and the contract shall be terminated in the event the authorities come to the conclusion that the breach is grave enough for that drastic step.
once the contract is; terminated the last procedure is realisation which can in no case be before the termination of the contract.
