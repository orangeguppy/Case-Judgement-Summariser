the constitutional requirement that the grounds must not be vague must be satisfied with respect to each of the grounds communicated to the person detained subject to the claim of privilege under el.
(6) of article 22 of the constitution.
where one of the grounds mentioned was "you have been organising the movement (praja parishad movement) by enrolling volunteers among the refugees in your capacity as president of the refugee association of bara hindu rao": held, that this ground was vague and even though the other grounds were not vague the detention was not in accordance with the procedure established by law and was therefore illegal.
