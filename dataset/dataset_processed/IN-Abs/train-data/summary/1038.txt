the appellants, who were dealers in cotton yarn, obtained a license under the madras general sales tax act, 1939 (ix of 1939).
section 5 of that act exempted such dealers from pay ment of sales tax under section 3 of the act subject to such restrictions and conditions as might be prescribed, including the conditions as to licenses and license fees.
section 13 required a licensee to keep and maintain true and correct accounts of the value of the goods sold and paid by him.
rule 5 of the general sales tax rules provided that any person seeking exemption under section 5 of the act must apply for license in form 1 which made the license subject to the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder.
the appellants on surprise inspection were found to maintain two separate sets of accounts, on the basis of one of which they submitted their returns and the other 737 showed black market activities.
the question for determination in the appeal was whether the appellants who had been refused exemption and were assessed to tax, could claim exemption under the act.
held, that the question must be answered in the negative.
section 5 of the madras general sales tax act, 1939, pro perly construed, leaves no manner of doubt that an exemption from assessment thereunder is clearly conditional upon the observance by the assessee of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the act, either in the rules or in the license itself, and the words 'subject to ' used by the section means "conditional upon".
it was not correct to say that licensee was exempt from assessment so long as he held the license notwithstanding any breach of the provision of the law and that the only penalty he could be subjected to was the cancellation of his license or criminal prosecution.
