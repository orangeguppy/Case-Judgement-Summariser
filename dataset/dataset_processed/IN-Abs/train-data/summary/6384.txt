rule 9(2) of the customs, excise and gold (control) appellate tribunal (procedure) rules, 1982 provides that an appeal filed under the direction of the collector or the administrator shall be accompanied by an attested copy of the order containing such direction.
pursuant to a general authority and an order of the collector (on the file note sheet) the appellant filed an appeal before the customs, excise and gold (control) appellate tribunal which dismissed it by holding that it was not in consonance with rule (2).
hence this appeal by the revenue.
setting aside the order of the tribunal and disposing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
having regard to the purpose of the rules namely, to ensure that there was an application of mind to the points in respect of which the question for filing an appeal arose and that the appeal was duly authorised by the collector, and was filed by the person authorised by the collector in order to ensure that frivolous and unnecessary appeals are not filed, it must be held that in the present context and in view of the terms of the rules and the pur pose intended to be served, the appeal was competent and was duly filed in compliance with the procedure as enjoined by the rules.
the rules were to carry out the purposes of the act.
therefore, the tribunal was in error in dismissing the appeal.
[1030d f, g] 2.
the matter is remanded to the tribunal for considera tion of the appeal on merits.
