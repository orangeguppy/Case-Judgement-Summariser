the respondent admitted the execution of two hundis in suit which were tendered and marked as exhibits but denied consideration and raised the plea that the hundis exhibited were inadmissible in evidence as at the time the suit was filed in 1949 they had not been stamped according to the stamp law.
when the hundis were executed in december, 1946, the marwar stamp act of 1914 was in force and sections 9 and 11 of that act authorised the court to realise the full stamp duty and penalty in case of unstamped instruments produced in evidence, whereupon the documents were admissible in evidence.
the high court pointed out that after coming into force of the marwar stamp act, 1947, (similar to indian stamp act) which had amended the 1914 act, the hundis in question could not be admitted in evidence in view of the provision of section 35 proviso (a) of the marwar stamp act, 1947, even on payment of duty and penalty and the appellant could not take advantage of section 36 of the 1947 stamp act, because 'the admission of the two hundis was a pure mistake as the trial court had lost sight of the 1947 stamp act and the appeal court could go behind the orders of the trial court and correct the mistake made by, that court.
held, that once the court, rightly or wrongly decided to 43 334 admit the document in evidence, so far as the parties were concerned, the matter was closed.
the court had to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document was tendered in evidence and before it was marked as an exhibit in the case, and once the document had been marked as an exhibit and the trial had proceeded on that footing section 36 of the marwar stamp act, 1947, came into operation, and, thereafter, it was not open either to the trial court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind that order.
such an order was not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be revised or reviewed by the same court or a court of superior jurisdiction.
