the mirasdars used to bring labourers from outside for harvest of paddy from their fields as local labourers were reluctant to harvest paddy at the wage of 4 1/2 measures of paddy.
the local labourers were very much aggrieved by this bringing of men from outside for harvesting of paddy.
on 25th december, 1968 one packiriswami pillai, since deceased, alongwith 17 other labourers of irakkai village was returning home at about 5.30 p.m. after harvesting of crops from the fields of p.w.15.
they reached the east west harijan street at about 7.30 p.m. mere was moon light and electric light.
there, p.ws. 31,32,34 to 44 saw a crowd of 10 to 15 persons standing.
in that crowd p.ws. 31,32,34 to 37 saw accused nos.l and 2 armed with aruvals.
the crowd questioned them as to which place they belonged to, whereon they replied that they belonged to irakkai.
immediately, a l, gopal cried out "do not leave irakkai people, cut them, beat them." p.ws. 31,32,34 to 37 while running found packiriswami pillai tripping and falling down near the electric lamp post on the harijan street.
they also saw accused nos. 1 and 2 and some others in the crowd lifting the deceased by hands, legs and clothes.
then he was carried to some distance towards the east.
at that time packiriswami pillai cried out that he was being cut by gopal (a l) and they were leaving him behind ant running.
p.ws. 31,32 and 34 to 37 saw the first accused cutting packiriswami pillai with aruval on his neck and on his head.
p.ws. 31,32, 34,35,36 and 37 ran towards the caste hindu street and ultimately entered into the house of p.w.47.
another crowd of 50 60 persons armed with aruvals and sticks came from the 200 south and they caused injuries on the persons of p.ws. 54 and 55 who came out of their house.
on getting information at about 8.00 p.m., p.w.72, the head constable, with some s.a.p. men went to keezha vanmani and after collecting the injured persons from the house of p.w.47 as well as collecting the injured p.w.54 and 55 in the van came to the keevalur police station where p.w.79 (inspector of police) recorded the statement of p.w.54 and registered the same as crime no. 326 of 1968.
he thereafter recorded the statements of p.w.55 and p.ws.
34 to 37 in the police station.
at about 11.45 p.m. p.w.79 left for keezha vanmani and met p.w.31 there.
then both of them went to nadu street and found the dead body of packiriswami pillai with multiple injuries.
p.w.79 recorded the statement of p.w.31 and registered the same as crime no. 328 of 1968.
out of 22 accused, the sessions judge acquitted 14 and convected 8, namely, accused nos.1,2,12,13,17,18,19 and 20 under various offences and sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for various terms.
te sessions judge found the aforesaid accused guilty of various offences on the grounds (1) that there was electric light and also moon light at the time of the occurrence and that p.ws. 31,32 and 34 to 37 witnessed the fatal injuries caused by aruvals on the head and neck of packiriswami pillai by gopal (a l); (2) that the crying out by the deceased packiriswami pillai that gopal (a l) was cutting him was in the nature of dying declaration and no motive could be ascribed for the deceased to falsely implicate the accused a l, gopal at that moment; (3) that the injuries sustained by p.ws. 34 to 36 with all probabilities establish the presence of these p.ws.
at a close range and seeing the occurrence; and (4) that there was also overwhelming evidence as to the presence of a l in the crowd.
the appeal of all the 8 accused persons filed before the high court was dismissed.
dismissing the appeal to this court, ^ held : 1.
m ere is no infirmity far less any illegality or failure of justice which would impel the supreme court to interfere with the order of conviction and sentence con currently arrived at by both the courts below.
[210 d] 2(i) p.ws.
34 to 37 have clearly stated in their depositions that they witnessed a l inflict cutting injuries on the neck and heat of packiriswami pillai after lifting him along 201 with other accused and carrying him to the east of harijan street.
the court of appeal below has rightly held that p.w. 54 was only concerned with the incident that occurred before his house and, as such, in exhibit p 11 there was only the reference to the said incident.
it was also held that p.w. 79 in his deposition refuted the suggestion that he did not examine p.w. 34 to 37 at the time alleged by him.
moreover, all these p.ws. 34 to 37 suffered several injuries being chased by the crowd while running forwards the house of p.w. 47.
therefore, evidences of all these eye witnesses as well as of p.w. 31 were believed by both the courts below that a l caused fatal cut injuries on the person of deceased packiriswami pillai.
[207 a c] 2(ii) p.w. 65, assistant surgeon, government hospital, who conducted postmortem also stated in his deposition that out of the 11 injuries caused on the person of deceased packiriswami pillai, the injuries nos. 1 and 2 which could have been caused by single cut were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
the doctor has also stated in his evidence that after the infliction of injury no. 1 the injured could have shouted out.
there is, therefore, ample evidence to negative the submission that the accused no. 1 was falsely implicated.
moreover, p.w. 72 has stated in his deposition that he is deaf and as such he could not hear whether p.ws. 34 to 37 stated about the injuries caused by a 1 on deceased packiriswami pillai.
he also stated that he heard p.ws. 34 to 37 uttering packiriswami, packiriswami.
it was rightly held by both the courts below that p.w. 72 was deaf and could not hear what they told him.
the non mentioning of attack on packiriswami pillai by p.w. 54 in his statement does not in any way lead to the inference that the statements of p.ws.
34 to 37 were recorded after recording of the statement of p.w. 31.
[207 d f] 3(i) p.w. 79 recorded the statement of p.ws.
34 to 37 in the police station after recording of the statements of p.ws. 54 and 55.
the mere recording of statements in plain sheet instead of in diary form in these circumstances does not lead to any where in view of the clear evidence of p.w. 79 which was believed by both the courts below that the statements of these p.ws.
were recorded by him immediately after recording the statement of p.w. 54 (exhibit p 11).
[207 h; 208 a] 3(ii) p.ws. 31,32 and 34 to 37 clearly stated in their evidence that they did not see p.w. 1 at all.
the evidence of p.w. 1 was that he did not go to caste hindu street at that 202 time.
in view of these evidence, the court of appeal below held that the evidence of p.w. 72 to the effect that p.w. 1 came near the house of p.w. 47 could not be accepted.
it was also pointed out by the court of appeal below that p.w. 72 has not spoken about presence of p.w. 1 at about that time either in crime no. 326 or in crime no. 328 of 1968.
it was only during the investigation in crime no. 327 of 1968 namely the connected arson case, p.w. 72 made the above statement.
[208 c d] 4.
it was not improbable that because at the time of the recording of statement of p.ws.
34 to 37, p.w. 79 was not aware of the death of packiriswami pillai, so he did not consider it a grave crime and did not register it separately as spoken to by him.
p.w. 79 further stated in his evidence that both the occurrences namely attack on p.ws. 54 and 55 and packiriswami pillai formed part of one and the same trans action.
p.w. 79 further admitted that he ought not to have registered a separate case in crime no. 328 of 1968 on the statement of p.w. 31.
it was rightly held by the court of appeal below that p.w. 79 adopted irregular procedure in registering separate crime number on the basis of the statement of p.w. 31 and this cannot lead to the inference that p.ws. 34 to 37 were examined only after examination of p.w. 31.
it was rightly held by the court of appeal below that these irregularities committed by p.w. 79 in not recording the statement of p.ws.
34 to 37 in case diary form and registering the separate crime number on the statement of p.w. 31 could not militate against the prosecution case.
no motive has been suggested against p.w. 79.
[208 g h; 209 a b] 5.
the accused 1 and 2 have been convicted by the courts below on the finding that the offences charged against them have been proved by the eye witnesses beyond any reasonable doubt.
there was no illegality nor any question of principle involved in the matter of making order sentencing them to imprisonment as provided in 88. 302 and 364 of the indian penal code.
therefore, the court is not inclined to interfere with the sentences passed by the courts below.
