the first respondent municipality governed by the municipal boroughs act, 1925 (bombay act xviii of 1925) consists of 32 councillors, s, (the appellant) being one of them.
the last general election to the municipality took place on the 7th may 1951.
the term of the councillors was three years computed from the first meeting held on 10th july 1951 after the general election.
in that meeting the 4th and 5th respondents were elected president and vice president respectively for a term of three years.
act xviii of 1925 was amended by bombay act xxxv of 1954 under which the term of office of the councillors was extended from 3 to 4 years ending on 9th july 1955.
as the term of respondents 4 and 5 was to expire at the end of three years from the 10th july 1951 and as the term of the municipality was extended by one year under the amending act xxxv of 1954 a fresh election of president and vicepresident was necessary to fill up the vacancies thus occurring.
the collector called a special general meeting for the 30th july 1954 to elect a president and vice president for the remaining period of the quadrennium and nominated the prant official (the district deputy collector) to preside over that meeting.
on the 30th july 1954 the prant officer adjourned the meeting to the 3rd august 1954 under instructions from the collector without transacting any business.
the objection raised by respondent no. 3 against the adjournment was overruled by the presiding officer.
the special general meeting was held on the 3rd august 1954.
an objection raised by s (the appellant) that under the provisions of the act a president could not be elected for a term less than a year was overruled by the presiding officer.
on this 13 councillors (including s) out of the 32 who were present walked out on the ground that the president was to be elected for a term less than a year contrary to the provisions of the act.
the remaining 19 councillors elected the 2nd respondent as the president for the remaining period of the quadrennium.
immediately after that another meeting presided over by the newly elected president elected respondent no. 3 as vice president.
the same point of order raised by s as in the case of the president was overruled, on which 6 councillors walked out and the meeting was held by the remaining councillors.
all the 32 councillors were present both on the 30th july 1954 and the 3rd august 1954.
an application under article 226 of the constitution presented by s questioning the validity of the meeting of the 3rd august, 1954, and consequently the validity of the election of respondents nos. 2 and 3 as president and vice president for the remaining period of the quadrennium was dismissed by the high court.
held, (1) that the meeting of the 3rd august 1954, in substance though not in form, complied with the requirements of the law for holding a valid special meeting and therefore the meeting was not invalid because the record of proceedings would show that whatever had been done on the 30th july 1954 and the 3rd august 1954 had been done under the orders of the collector.
the notice to the councillors required under section 35(3) of the act satisfied the requirements of three clear days, that the provisions of section 35(3) regarding the ser 1270 vice of notice are directory and not mandatory; and that any omissions in the manner of service of the notice are more irregularities which would not vitiate the proceedings unless it is shown that those irregularities had prejudicially affected the proceedings which had not been alleged or proved in the present case.
all the councillors constituting the municipality were present on both the occasions namely the 30th july 1954 and the 3rd august 1954 and thus had ample notice of the meeting to be held on the 3rd august 1954, the time and place of the meeting and the business to be transacted.
that under the provisions of section 35(3) of the act the presence at or the absence from the meeting of the members of the public has no legal consequence so far as the validity of the election is concerned; (2) that as section 19 of the bombay boroughs act, (bombay act xviii of 1925) had been amended by the bombay municipal boroughs act, 1954 (bombay act liv of 1954) and was retrospective in its operation, it had the effect of curing any illegality or irregularity in the election with reference to the provisions of section 19 of the act and therefore respondents nos. 2 and 3 had been validly elected as president and, vice president respectively.
