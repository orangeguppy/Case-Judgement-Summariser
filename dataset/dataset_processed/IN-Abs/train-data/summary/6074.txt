it declared its assessable value on the basis of the price at which it sold the goods.
show cause notices, requiring assessable value to he determined at the price the buyers of the respondent company sold the goods, issued to the re spondent were challenged by it and quashed by the high court.
hence this appeal by the revenue.
dismissing the appeal, this court held: 1.

the high court, therefore, rightly quashed the show cause notices.
