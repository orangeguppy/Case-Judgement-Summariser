the sales of teas were by auction which was conducted in fort cochin in madras state.
the price was paid in fort cochin and delivery orders were also given there for goods which were at willingdon island in travancore cochin state.
from willingdon islands the goods were sent for consumption to other states and to foreign countries.
the state of travancore cochin sought to tax these transactions for sales tax.
held that the property in the goods passed when the contract was accepted on the fall of the hammer in fort cochin.
under article 286(1) it was the "passing of the property within the state" that was intended to be fastened on for the purpose of determining whether the sale was "inside" or "outside" the state.
subject to the operation of the "explanation" that state in which property passed would be the only state which would have the power levy the tax on the sale.
but the explanation did not apply in the present case as there was no delivery as a direct result of the sale for consumption in any particular state.
