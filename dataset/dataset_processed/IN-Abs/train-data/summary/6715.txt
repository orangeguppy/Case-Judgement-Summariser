on the application for pre mature release, made by the respondent, who was undergoing sentence of life imprisonment and had served a period of eleven and a half years the high court directed that the respondent 's mercy petition pending before the governor, should be decided within three months.
since this was not done, the high court directed his release on bail, observing that if his mercy petition was dismissed he would have to surrender.
against this decision the state filed an appeal before this court.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: the high court has not taken into consideration the provisions of section 433a of the criminal procedure code, 1973 while passing the order for the respondent 's release on bail.
the judicial proceeding dealing with the conviction and sentence of the accused had been earlier concluded, and the order was passed while finally disposing of the writ petition alleging delay in disposal of the mercy petition.
thus, no case is now pending before the court.
the order for the respondent 's release on bail has not therefore, been passed as an interim measure pending the decision of a case before the court.
in such a situation the provisions of section 433a are attracted.
the words "such person shall not be released from prison" are wide in their application and cannot be restricted only to case where the person has been released finally.
the judgment in question is set aside and the case remitted to the high court for reconsideration of writ petition confined to its limited scope.
