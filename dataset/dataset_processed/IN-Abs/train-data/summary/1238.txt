the petitioner was convicted in 1949 and sentenced to trans portation for life.
he earned remission of 2963 days and adding this to the term of imprisonment actually served by the petitioner the aggregate exceeded 20 years.
the petitioner contended that his further detention in jail was illegal and prayed for being set at liberty: held, that the petitioner had not yet acquired any right to be released.
a sentence of transportation for life could be undergone by a prisoner by way of rigorous imprisonment for life in a designated prison in india.
section 53a of the indian penal code, introduced by the code of criminal procedure (amendment) act, 1955, provided that any person sentenced to transportation for life before the amendment act would be treated as sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life.
a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment was bound to serve the remainder of his life in prison unless the sentence was commuted or remitted by the appropriate authority.
such a sentence could not be equated with any fixed term.
the rules framed under the prisons act entitled such a prisoner to earn remissions but such remissions were to be taken into account only towards the end of the term.
the question of remissions was exclusively within the province of the appropriate government.
in the present case though the government had made certain remissions under section 401 of the code of criminal procedure, it had not remitted the entire sentence.
