set off against his losses in the individual business and the income tax officer determined the loss to be carried forward at rs.
53,840, but did not notify to the assessee by order in writing the amount of the loss as computed by him as required by section 24(3) of the act.
the assessee appealed against the assessment but did not question the amount of the loss which had been determined.

2,116760.
this contention was rejected by the tribunal.
the contention was again raised by the assessee in the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 50.

the assessee was entitled to have 187 the loss redetermined in a subsequent year though he had not filed an appeal against the determination of the loss but no appeal could be filed in the absence of an order in writing.
