six seats are allotted to the state of jammu and kashmir in the house of people (lok sabha) and election to those seats should ordinarily have been by direct election under article 81(1) of the constitution but the president modified that article under article 370(1) by para.
5(c) of the constitution (application to jammu and kashmir) order, 1954, to the effect that "the representatives of the state in the house of people shall be appointed by the president on the recommendations of the legislature of the state".
the petitioner who claimed to be a registered elector and as such eligible for election from any parliamentary constituency in india contended that the president had exceeded his powers when he made this modification for he thereby substituted direct election to the house of people by nomination which he could not do, and that the said modi fication amounted to radical alteration in article 81 and was not justified under article 370(1).
held, that the word "modification" used in article 370(i) must be given the widest meaning in the context of the consti tution and in that sense it includes an amendment and it cannot be limited to such modifications as do not make any "radical transformation".
the modification lays down that the president will make the nomination on the recommendation of the state legislature which can do so only by voting, and in effect it provides that the seats will be filled by indirect election and not direct election.
the element of election being thus still present there was no radical alteration in article 81 and the president had the power to make the modification which he did.
