the petitioner sought modification of the court 's order that the trial should proceed from day to day on the ground that his advocates were not prepared to appear in the case from day to day as the trial was likely to be prolonged.
dismissing the petition, ^ held: it will be in the interest of both the prosecution and the defence that the trial proceeds from day to day.
before commencing a trial, a sessions judge must satisfy himself that all necessary evidence is available.
if it is not, he may postpone the case, but only on the strongest possible ground and for the shortest possible period.
once the trial commences, he should, except for a very pressing reason which makes an adjournment inevitable, proceed de die in diem until the trial is concluded.
[439c d] it is the duty of every advocate who accepts the brief in a criminal case to attend the trial from day to day.
having accepted the brief, he will be committing a breach of his professional duty, if he so fails to attend.
