the respondent joined the service of the composite state of punjab and haryana on june 22, 1957 as the state 's press liaison officer at delhi in the public relations department of the state.
the original appointment was to last till february 28, 1958 but was continued by orders passed from time to time.
the respondent went on leave for about six months from november 21, 1959 to may 18, 1960 with permission to act in pakistan as a special correspondent of the hindustan times delhi.
on return from leave he was posted in the same service in the post of deputy director (field) from july 19, 1960 to september 19, 1960.
later on he was again posted as officer on special duty which was also an equivalent post, from september 20, 1960 to june 26, 1962.
when he crossed the efficiency bar in 1960 his salary was raised with effect from december 24, 1960.
he was appointed as deputy director (press) which post was held by him from june 27, 1962 to june 14, 1966.
by order dated june 24, 1966 the governor of punjab appointed him as state press liaison officer with effect from june 14, 1966 and he was posted to delhi.
this post had been kept in abeyance during the period when he was deputy director (press).
on the reorganisation of the composite state of punjab and its bifurcation into the states of punjab and haryana the post of state press liaison officer.
delhi, held by him was allocated to the state of haryana with effect from november 1, 1966.
he was also allotted to the state of haryana.
he remained on deputation with the punjab government from december 1, 1966 to march 24, 1967 and again resumed his duty as state press liaison officer, new delhi, from march 25, 1967 under the government of haryana.
by order dated october 31, 1968 the haryana government terminated his services.
the respondent filed a writ petition in the high court.
the high court rejected the plea of mala fides raised by the respondent but allowed the writ petition holding in the respondent 's favour that (a) under rule 10(3) of the gazetted service rules the respondent on completing three years service as deputy director (press) had become a permanent employee of the government , (b) the appointment of the respondent to the post of state press liaison officer was co terminus with the existence of the post and the respondent was entitled to continue in the post while it was in existence i.e. up to february 28, 1969.
on the above grounds the high court quashed the order dated october 31, 1968.
following the high court 's order the state government reinstated the appellant but filed an appeal in this court challenging the high court 's judgment.
apart from the merits, the court 453 had to consider the preliminary objection of the respondent to the effect that in view of the fact that the respondent had been reinstated in service the question of the validity of the original order passed on october 31, 1968 terminating the services of the respondent, did not survive for con sideration.
held : (i) the circumstance that the respondent was are instated in service by the order dated december 5, 1969 could not and does not debar the state from challenging the judgment of the high court.
in fact immediately after passing the order dated december 5, 1969.
the state had been taking very active steps to challenge the decision of the high court.
it followed that the state was entitled in the present appeal to challenge the decision of the high court setting aside the order dated october 31, 1968.
the preliminary objection must accordingly be over ruled.
[457 d e] (ii) the approach of the high court in considering the allegation of mala fides was not proper.
the high court had taken each allegation by itself and had held that it was not sufficient to establish mala fides.
the proper approach should have been to consider all the allegations together and find out whether those allegations had been made out and whether those allegations when established were sufficient to prove malice or ill will on the part of the officials concerned and whether the impugned order was the result of such malice or ill will, [472 b c] on the facts of the case the plea of mala fides alleged by the respondent against the second and third appellants could not be accepted [475 f] principles laid down in section pratap singh vs state of punjab, ; , followed.
(iii) when the respondent was appointed deputy director (press) the former incumbent of the post r who was promoted as joint director, continued to have lien on it under r. 3.14 of the civil service rules.
under r. 3.11(c) of the civil service rules a government servant cannot be appointed substantively to a post on which another government servant holds a lien.
therefore on the date when the respondent was appointed as deputy director (press) he could not have been appointed to that post substantively as r was having a lien on the post.
the various payslips which are on record also show that the respondent 's appointment must have been on an officiating basis as defined in r. 2.42 of the civil service rules.
the objections of the public service commission to the respondent 's appointments as deputy director (press) were also on record.
all these circumstances were against the contentions of the respondent of his having been appointed against a permanent vacancy.
[481 a d] the essential requisite for the applicability of r. 10 is that a person must have been appointed against a permanent vacancy.
as the respondent had been working in the post of deputy director (press) only in an officiating capacity the question of extending hi , probation or confirming him tinder r. 10 of the gazetted service rules did not arise, and if so the question of calculating the total period of probation of three years which is necessary for the application of the proviso to r. 10(3) did not arise.
[482 g] the circumstance that with effect from april 1.
1964 the post of deputy director (publicity material) was made permanent could not help the respondent as he had not been at all appointed in the first instance against a permanent vacancy.
the view taken by the high court, to the contrary, could not be sustained.

(iii) no orders had been placed before the court to show that the appointment of the respondent as state press liaison officer was on a temporary basis and was not co terminus with the post.
on the other hand the assistant accounts officer had issued payslip dated april 22, 1968 which was on record to the treasury officer, delhi stating that the payslip issued in favour of the respondent who was the state press liaison officer, haryana, new delhi, on august 31, 1967 may be deemed as operative upto and inclusive of february 28, 1969.
it was not disputed that at the time when the said payslip was issued, the duration of the post had been extended upto february 28, 1969.
in view of all the circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the appointment of the respondent as state press liaison officer was co terminus with the continuance of the post.
it followed that the state had no power to terminate the services of the respondent when the post itself was continuing.
if any action by way of disciplinary proceedings was being taken then the state should have complied with article 311(2) of the constitution which they had admittedly not done in this case.
the order of the state government dated october 31, 1968 terminating the services of the respondent was accordingly held to be illegal, [489 h, 490 a, e, g]
