the appellant piarey lal had agreed to sell his original holding to hori lal but later refused to do so on the ground that his property which was the subject matter of the con tract had been consolidated under the u.p. consolidation of holdings act, 1953, and it was impossible to perform the agreement.
hori lal filed a suit for specific performance contending that the agreement for sale had created a liabil ity for piarey lal for the purpose of section 30(b) of the act, and the same was transferred to the new plot or "chak" allotted to him as a result of the consolidation.
the suit was decreed by the trial court and piarey lal 's appeals before the district court and the high court were dismissed.
allowing the appeal by special leave the court, held: by virtue of section 54 of the transfer of property act, the agreement for sale did not give rise to any inter est "in" the original holding of the defendant as the ten ure holder.
there could thus be no occasion for the transfer of any such , 'liability" in his new land or "chak" so as to attract clause (b) of section 30 of the act.
when he lost that property as a result of the scheme of consolida tion, the agreement for sale became void.
