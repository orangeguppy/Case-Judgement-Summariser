the appellant was convicted for under under section 302 indian penal code.
the prosecution relied on amongst other materials, a letter.
the letter contained a confession and was addressed to the sub inspector.
the appellant wrote the letter with the intention that it should be received by the sub inspector, kept it near the dead body and left the house after locking it.
the lock was broken open and the letter was recovered by the sub inspector.
in appeal to this court the admissibility of this letter was challenged.
held: (per curium) there was sufficient material on the record, apart from this letter, establishing the guilt of the appellant.
per sarkar, c.j. and mudholkar, j: the letter was admissible in evidence.
no doubt, the letter contained a confession and was addressed to a police officer.
that could not make it a confession made to the police officer which is within the bar created by section 25 of the evidence act.
the police officer was not nearby when the letter was written or knew that it was being written.
in such circumstances quite obviously the letter would not have been a confession to the police officer if the words "sub inspector" had not been written.
nor it can become one in similar circumstances only because the words "sub inspector" has been written there.
it would still have not been a confession made to a police officer for the simple reason that it was not so made from any point of view.
[267 h 268 b] per bachawat j., the letter was inadmissible in evidence and was a confession made to a police officer.
[268 d e] a confession to a police officer was within the bar of section 25, though it was not made in his presence.
a confessional letter written to a police officer and sent to him by post, messenger or otherwise is not outside the ban of section 2,5 because the police officer was ignorant of the letter at the moment when it was being written.
