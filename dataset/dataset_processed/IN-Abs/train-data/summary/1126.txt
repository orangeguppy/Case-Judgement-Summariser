during controversy between two brothers each of whom claimed to be appointed mutawalli, the commissioner of wakfs appointed a third brother as a temporary mutawalli under section 40 of the bengal wakf act, which appointment was challenged on the ground that the order of the commissioner appointing a temporary mutawalli was illegal because under the rules framed by the government of west bengal the board constituted under bengal wakf act could alone make the appointment and the commissioner could only make a report and recommendation to the board.
held, that under the provisions of section 40 read with section 29 of the bengal wakf act, a temporary mutawalli can be appointed by the commissioner to whom the powers and duties have been 760 delegated by the board.
the rules cannot affect the powers of the board to delegate its functions under section 29 of the act to the commissioner, and once the delegation is made the rules cease to apply.
held, further, that where power and duty are interconnected and it is not possible to separate one from the other in such wise that power can be delegated while duty is retained and vice versa, the delegation of powers takes with it the duties.
