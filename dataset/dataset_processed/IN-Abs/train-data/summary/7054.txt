in a notification dated 28.9.1972, with a view to induce the sugar factories (respondents) to produce more and also to commence their operations early in the sugar year (the year commencing on and with 1st october and ending with the 30th of september of the following year) a rebate was provided.
the scheme of the notification was (1)if during the months of october and november 1972 (in the sugar year 1972 73), a factory produced sugar in excess of the quantity of sugar produced by it during the months of october november 1971, suchfactory was granted rebate in the excise duty at the rate of rupees forty per quintal in so far as the excess production is concerned.
(2)rebate for the period 1st december 1972 to 30th april, 1973 was available at the rate of rupees twenty per quintal provided the production of sugar during the said period was in excess of 115% of the quantity of sugar produced by the said factory during the corresponding period in the previous sugar year, in so far as the excess production is concerned.
(3)for the months of may and june 1973 rebate at the rate of rupees twenty per quintal was available provided the factory produced more sugar than it produced during the corresponding months in the previous sugar year.
the said rebate was available again only with respect to the excess production.
759 (4)for the period commencing from 1st july, 1973 and ending with 30th of september, 1973, rebate was available at the rate of rupees twently per quintal provided the factory produced sugar in excess of the quantity produced during the corresponding period in the previous sugar year.
this rebate too was confined to the excess production.
however, the benefit of the rebate mentioned in any of the clauses aforesaid was not available to a factory which inter alia did not work during the 'base pariod '.
the other three notifications dated 4.10.73, 12.10.74 and 30.9.76 were similar.
all the four notifications were applicable to the sugar years 1972 73, 1973 74, 1974 75 and 1976 77, respectively.
the respondents sugar factories did not produce any sugar in one or the other of the four blocks (mentioned in the table contained in the notification) in the base year (previous sugar year).
during the current sugar year, they produced certain quantity of sugar during that block period.
the respondents contended that they were entitled to the benefit of rebate provided in clause (1) of the table contained in the notification, whereas the revenue submitted that they were not entitled to the benefit of rebate.
the claim for rebate made by the respondnets was allowed in the first instance, but later proceedings were initiated to recover back, or re adjust, the benefit already allowed.
these disputes were carried to the high courts.
almost all the high courts except karnataka held in favour of the respondents.
in patna high court, there was a conflict of opinion.
hence this batch of appeals by the revenue contending that the benefit of rebate was available only where the "sugar produced in a factory during the period commencing from the 1st day of october, 1972 and ending with the 30th day of november, 1972 which is in excess of the quantity of sugarproduced during the corresponding "period in 1971"; that nil production could not be equated to "the quantity of sugarproduced" in clause (1); that clause (1) of the first proviso in the 1972 notification has 760 to be harmonised with the several clauses in the table; and that no interpretation should be adopted which rendered any part of the notification superfluous.
dismissing all.
the civil appeals, except civil appeal nos. 3831 32 of 1988, this court, held : 1.01.
the several clauses in the notification must be read together, harmonised and reasonably understood without ignoring the underlying object and purpose of the notification.
an interpretation which leads to absurd consequences should be avoided.
[770 e] 1.02.the object behind the notification was evidently not only to induce the factories to produce more sugar but also to induce them to start their production early in the sugar year.
the object appears to be also to induce the factories to keep on producing the sugar all the year round, which they may perhaps not have done otherwise.
running the factories during the off season (off season means october november period and then again the period from may june to september), may have its own problems which may increase the cost of production.
main issue is whether the words "the quantity of sugar produced during the corresponding period. " do not take in the case of a factory which has not produced any sugar whatsoever during the relevant corresponding period? it does take in.
holding otherwise would have this absurd consequence: a factory which has produced, say, just one quintal of sugar during the relevant corresponding period and has produced 1000 quintals during october november, 1972 would qualify for the rebate on 999 quintals while another factory which has not produced any sugar nil production but has produced 1000 quintals during october november, 1972, would not qualify.
[770 g h] 1.04.the idea behind the notification is to induce the manufacturers to produce more in the current sugar year than what they have produced in the previous sugar year or during the previous corresponding period in the previous sugar year, as the case may be.
where a factor; has not produced any sugar or has produced a particular quantity of sugar during the said period in the previous sugar year but produces a larger quantity during the said period in the current sugar year, it must be rewarded.
[771 b d] 761 1.05.the case of october november appears to be rather an exception.
normally, it appears, no factory owner commenced the production of sugar in these months because of several unfavorable factors.
indeed, these unfavorable factors appear to be present to a large extent even during the 'months june to september.
the notifications were evidently meant to compensate the factory owners for producing during these months as well.
1772 c d] 1.06.one must proceed on the assumption that every industrialist and businessman would, ordinarily, like to produce as much more as possible, since, normally speaking, more production means more profits.
[772 e] 1.07.no manufacturer produces sugar merely for the sake of rebate.
rebate is an inducement, an additional attraction.
it is not as if without rebate provided by these notifications, no one would have produced sugar.
[771 d] 1.08.there is no arithmetical difficulty in working out 115% of zero; it is zero.
what applies to clause(1) applies equally to clauses (2), (3) and (4).
it is only that the factory need not necessarily have worked during each of the corresponding periods in the base year; it is enough if it has worked in the base year.
[771 e f] 1.09.the interpretation placed upon the said notifications by the majority of the high courts is the correct one.
the view taken by the karnataka high court in its judgment under appeal in civil appeal nos. 3831 32 of 1988 and the view taken by the patna high court in ill civil writ jurisdiction case no. 865 of 1966 are not correct.
basis for the percentages prescribed in the notification dated 12th october.
1974 the average production of the previous five years and not the excess production.
by way of illustrates, take a factory which produces 2500 tons during the period dec.1, 1974 to sept. 30, 1975 as against the average production of 1000 tons during the corresponding periods in the five previous sugar years.
out of 2,500 quintals produced during the said period in the current sugar year (december 1, 1974 to september 30, 1975), the average of the corresponding periods of the five previous sugar years ie., 1000 quintals should be deducted first, which means the excess production during the said period during the current year is 1500 quintals.
7.5% of 1000 quintals is 75 quintals.
on this quantity 762 of 75 quintals, the rate of rebate as per sub clause (a) will be rs. per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and rs. 5 per quintal in the case of levy sugar.
next 10% of excess production means 100 quintals which would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (b) at the rate of rs. 40 per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and rs. 10 per quintal in the case of levy sugar.
the next 100 quintals would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (c) at the rate of rs. 50 per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and rs. 14 per quintal in the case of levy sugar.
then again the next 100 quintals would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (d) at the rate of rs. 60 per quintall in the case of free sale sugar and rs. 18 per quintal in the case of levy sugr.
the balance of 1125 quintals would qualify for rebate under sub clause (e) at the rate of rs. 82 per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and rs. 22 per quintal in the case of levy sugar.
