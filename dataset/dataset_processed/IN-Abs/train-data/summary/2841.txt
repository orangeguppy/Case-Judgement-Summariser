at a public meeting held a few days after the decision of this court on the constitutional validity of the banking companies (acquisition of transfer of undertakings) act 22 of 1969, k, a minister in the central government, was reported by newspaper$ to have made certain critical remarks which, two petitioners before the court contended constituted a serious contempt of this court.
the petitioners swore an affidavit in support of their petition based on the newspapers reports.
as the court considered that some of the alleged observations, prima facie, exceeded the bounds of legitimate criticism, a notice to show cause was issued to k.
in reply k filed an affidavit denying the main 'allegations and contending that he has been misreported.
in support of his own affidavit, three other affidavits were filed by persons present at the public meeting.
although an application was made for summoning the reporters present at the public meeting, the court did not consider it necessary to prolong the hearing of the case as on the material before the court there was nothing to contradict the affidavits which denied the accuracy of the newspaper reports.
however, while closing the case, the court observed : while fair and temperate criticism of this court or any other court even if strong, may not be actionable, attributing improper motives, or tending to bring judges or courts into hatred and contempt or obstructing directly or indirectly the functioning of courts is serious contempt of which notice must and will be taken.
respect is expected not only from those to whom the judgment of the court is acceptable but also from those to whom it is repugnant.
those who err in their criticism by indulging in vilification of the institution of courts administration of justice and the instruments through which the administration acts, should take heed for they will act at their own peril.
