in 1925 the sikh gurdwaras act, 1925, was passed, inter alia, for the better administration of certain sikh gurdwaras, and after the merger of the erstwhile state of patiala and the east punjab states union, called pepsu, with the state of punjab, the act was amended by the sikh gurdwaras (amendment) act, 1959, in order to extend the act to the area which was formerly within pepsu.
under section 43 of the act, before it was amended in 959, a board had been constituted, called the sikh (1) lah.
500 gurdwara prabandhak committee, to act as the committee of management in respect of some of the principal sikh gurd waras and in addition to exercise control, direction and general superintendence over all committees appointed under the provisions of the act ; the board consisted of three categories of members, namely (1) elected members, (2) certain designated members, and (3) co opted members, which included persons residing in pepsu and other parts of india.
by the amending act of 1959, s 148b was added to the main act, which provided: " (1) as from the commencement of the amending act, in addition to the members of the board constituted under section 43 (a) every person in the extended territories who immediately before the commencement of the amending act, is a member of the interim gurdwara board, patiala, constituted by punjab government shall be deemed to be a member of the board, constituted under section 43 ; and (b) thirty five sikhs including six sikhs belonging to the scheduled castes residents in the extended territories who shall be elected by the persons specified in sub section
(2) in accordance with the rules made in this behalf by the state government, shall become the members of the board. .".
the petitioners who profess and practice the sikh faith filed a petition under article 32 of the constitution challenging the constitutional validity of section 148b on the ground that the section violated the fundamental right granted under article 26(b) of the constitution to every religious denomination or any section thereof including the sikh denomination " to manage its own affairs in matters of religion".
they contended, inter alia, (1) that the amending act of 1959 was passed with a view that a particular group of sikhs might not regain the majority it had lost on november 16, 1958, when the annual election of the sikh gurdwara prabandhak committee was held; (2) that the members of the interim board, patiala, who under section 148b(1)(a) are deemed to be members of the board constituted under section 43, were appointed under a punjab government notification, and being merely nominees of government did not represent the sikh community; that under section 148b thirty five sikhs from the extended area were introduced into the board by means of an indirect method, that is, by a limited sikh electorate, the members of which electorate were in their turn elected by sikhs as well as non sikhs ; that the right guaranteed under article 26(b) was given to all members of the sikh denomination to manage sikh gurdwaras, that the right must be exercised by all sikhs who alone must elect their representatives and that the introduction of new members into the board in respect of the extended territories in the manner envisaged by section 148b, violated by itself the right of the sikhs in a matter of religion and constituted an infringement of their fundamental right under article 26(b).
held : (1) that in considering the question as to whether a 501 provision of law is constitutionally valid, the court cannot be called upon to embark on an enquiry into public policy or investigate into questions of political wisdom or even to pronounce upon motives of the legislature in enacting a law which it is otherwise competent to make ; (2) that a direct election by the entire sikh community in the management of gurdwaras is not part of the sikh religion; and, (3) that the method of representation for the extended areas under section 148b of the act was an arrangement dictated merely by considerations of convenience and expediency, and did not involve any principle of religion.
accordingly, section i48b of the act ( lid not affect " matters of religion " within the meaning of article 26(b) of the constitution and consequently did not contravene the fundamental right under that article.
