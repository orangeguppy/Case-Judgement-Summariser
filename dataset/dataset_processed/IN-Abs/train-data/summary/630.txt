it was urged on behalf of respondent no. 1 that the suit had not been brought within one year as prescribed by section 5(2) of the act, and was as such barred by limitation; and, that since the notice prescribed by section 53 of the act had admittedly not been served on the respondent, the suit was incompetent.
it was found that in an earlier suit, brought with the sanction of the advocate general, against the managing committee for their removal and the framing of a fresh scheme, a decree had been passed against the appellants on october 16 1941, and it directed them not to interfere with the affairs of the darga as members of the said committee and to comply with the direction removing them from office.
on appeal the said decree was set aside by the chief court on march 7, 1946.
it was contended on behalf of the appellants that section 5(2) of the act had no application and even if it had, the suit was within time by virtue of the provisions of section 15 of the limitation act.
held, that the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants must be negatived.
the expression " any person interested in a waqf " used in section 5(2) of the united provinces muslims waqf act, 1936, pro perly construed, means any person interested in a transaction that is held to be waqf by the commissioner of waqfs appointed under the act and as such the appellants fell within that category.

offerings made from time to time by the devotees visiting the darga sharif were by their very nature an income of the darga, and failure to mention them in the notification under section 5(1) of the act, did not render the notification defective.
