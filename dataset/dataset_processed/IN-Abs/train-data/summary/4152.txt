the petitioner, a convict under death sentence, through a letter to one of the judges of this court alleged that torture was practised upon another prisoner by a jail warder, to extract money from the victim through his visiting relations.
the letter was converted into a habeas corpus proceeding.
the court issued notice to the state and the concerned officials.
it also appointed amicus curiae and authorised them to visit the prison, meet the prisoner, see relevant documents and interview necessary witnesses so as to enable them to inform them selves about the surrounding circumstances and the scenario of events.
the amicus curiae after visiting the jail and examining witnesses reported that the prisoner sustained serious anal injury because a rod was driven into that aperture to inflict inhuman torture and that as the bleeding had not stopped, he was removed to the jail hospital and later to the irvin hospital.
it was also reported that the prisoner 's explanation for the anal rupture was an unfulfilled demand of the warder for money, and that attempts were made by the departmental officers to hush up the crime by overawing the prisoner and the jail doctor and offering a story that the injury was either due to a fall of self inflication or due to piles.
