a new temple was constructed in place of the old dilapidated temple by the money contributed by the villagers.
it was alleged that respondents nos. 1 to 3 were mismanaging the affairs of the temple and were not regularly performing the puja or the duty.
an enquiry was ordered pursuant to which the inspector submitted his report stating that the temple was a public temple and that respondents nos.
1 to 3 did not show accounts to the inspector and that, therefore, names of 5 persons were suggested for appointment of non hereditary trustees.
a proclamation inviting objections regarding the suitability of 5 persons was issued.
after making a summary enquiry in the presence of the villagers including respondents nos. 1 to 3 the additional assistant commissioner passed an order holding that the institution was a public one and appointed 5 non hereditary trustees under section 27 of the act.

1 to 3 were hereditary trustees or not.

the appellants contended before the high court that the provisions of section 27 were independent and that it could be invoked without prior determination of the question under section 41.
the high court allowed the writ petition holding that section 27 should be applied only where in respect of the disputed institution there had been a prior determination of the controversial rights mentioned in section 41 and that before the assistant endowments commissioner could proceed under section 27 of the act to assess non hereditary trustees it was necessary for him to come to a finding that the institution was a public one and there were no hereditary trustees thereof in existence and in order to come to such a finding he should have completed an enquiry under section 41 which coupled with section 44 provided for a judicial determination of these very questions.
