the appellants were charged with offences under section 143/402, 186 and 353, indian penal code for having obstructed and assaulted two public servant in the discharge of their public duty of executing the decree of a civil court.
they were acquitted by the trial court, but on appeal, the high court convicted them under section 353, acquitted them under sections 143/402 and held that the prosecution under section 186 was barred by a. 195, criminal procedure code, which requires a complaint in writing by the public servant before a court could take cognizance of the offence.
in appeal to this court, it was contended that the prosecution under section 353, indian penal code, was also barred by section 195 criminal procedure code.
held : sections 186 and 353, indian penal code, relate to two distinct offences and section 353 is not referred to in section 195 cr.
p.c. section 195, criminal procedure code, does not bar the trial of an accused person for a distinct offence disclosed by the same set of facts, but which is not within the ambit of that section, when there is no camouflage or evasion to circumvent the section.
therefore the trial of the appellants for the distinct offence under section 353 was not barred though it was based practically on the same facts as for the prosecution under section 186, and the high court was justified, on the evidence, in interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the trial court in regard to that charge.
