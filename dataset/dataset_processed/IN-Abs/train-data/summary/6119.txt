on 20th february, 1975, the state government published a joint seniority list of teachers of subordinate education service belonging to the boys branch, and the higher second ary teachers of the subordinate educational service.
this joint gradation list was challenged before the high court, but the writ petition was dismissed as also an application for review of the dismissal.
the special leave petition against the aforesaid decision was dismissed by this court on 30th march, 1981.
the aforesaid single cadre known as secondary education service was difurcated by the state government by its noti fication dated 8th november 1986 under which the subordinate education service (teaching branch) determination of senior ity rules, were framed under the proviso to article 309 of the constitution this bifurcation scheme was challenged in the high court.
the stand of the government was that the demand for such bifurcation was taken up in the legislature and in terms of the decision of the implementation committee of the bihar legislative council, the new scheme for bifurcation had to he implemented.
the high court by its decision dated 27th november, 1987 quashed the notification dated 18th november, 1986 under which the bifurcation was done.
the high court was of the view that though the authority of the state to frame rules in terms of the proviso to article 309 was unquestionable, yet notice had to he tam of time fact that those who stood 659 together and fell in line to proceed further in the seniori ty list have to he provided all opportunities in respect of their avenues of promotion alike without breaking that order, so that one who ranks higher in the grade may not go down in due course of service, and held that the rules in the notification dated 18th november, 1986 were ultra vires articles 16(1) and 14 of the constitution.
dismissing the special leave petition to this court, held: the high court, rightly found fault with the state government action, and holding that the rules in the notifi cation dated 18th november, 1986 are ultra vires articles 16(1) and 14 of the constitution.
[660f] counsel for the state was not able to dislodge the conclusion that bifurcation was the outcome of an attempt to provide quick promotional avenues to those who were lower down in the joint cadre and would not have come within the range of consideration for promotional benefits but by bifurcation became entitled to such benefits.
