the appellant made an application before the industrial tri bunal under section 33 of the , for permission to dismiss the respondents, its employees, on the ground of misconduct under cl.
17 (b) (viii) of the appellant 's standing 872 orders, but subsequently, on a reconsideration of the facts, made another application praying instead for permission to discharge the respondents under cl.
14(a) of the standing orders.
the industrial tribunal found that the second application was bona fide made by the appellant with the honest motive of exercising its right to discharge the respondents instead of visiting upon them the penalty of dismissing them, and granted the appellant permission on payment to the respondents of one month 's pay in lieu of notice.
the labour appellate tribunal, on appeal, was of the opinion that having once alleged misconduct against the respondents the appellant could not be allowed to adopt the expedient of terminating their services by giving notice for the requisite period, by means of a fresh application, and after considering whether the appellant had made out a case under cl.
i7(b)(viii) of the standing orders, came to the conclusion that the respondents had not been guilty of any misconduct, and held that the industrial tribunal erred in granting the permission to discharge the respondents.
on appeal to the supreme court: held, that in an application under section 33 of the industrial: disputes act, 1947, the relevant consideration was whether the employer was guilty of any unfair labour practice or victimisation, and unless the tribunal came to a conclusion adverse to the applicant it would have no jurisdiction to refuse the permission asked for to discharge the employee.
accordingly, in view of the finding of the industrial tribunal that the application was bona fide, no question of law arose out of its order, and the labour appellate tribunal erred in entertaining the appeal.
