the appellant executed a lease for a period of 21 years, in respect of the respondents flat consisting of 3 bedrooms, at a monthly rent of rs. 350.
as the respondent delivered possession of only 2 bed rooms, the appellant suspended the payment of rent altogether.
the respondent thereupon filed a suit for recovery of rent in the court of small causes but it was dismissed.
in an application under section 38 of the presidency small causes court act the full bench of the small causes court decreed the suit, and the decree was confirmed in the appellant 's revision petition to the high court under section 115 of the civil procedure code and article 227 of the constitution.
in appeal to this court, held : the appellant must pay a proportionate part of the rent, because, it would be inequitable to allow the respondent, on the one hand, to recover the full rent when he had not delivered possession of the whole of the premises, and on the other, to allow the appellant to enjoy a substantial portion of the property of the landlord without much inconvenience as a windfall.
it will depend on the circumstances of each case whether a tenant would be entitled to suspend payment of the rent fully or whether he should be held liable to pay the proportionate part of the rent.
