in this group of cases a common question of law that falls for determination by the court is whether the provisions of the uttar pradesh urban buildings (regulation of letting, rent and eviction) act, act no. 13 of 1972 are applicable to cantonments situated in the state of u.p.
the high court has answered this question in the affirmative.
hence these appeals by tenants.
the main judgment under appeal is in the case of brij, sunder kapoor vs additional district judge & ors., [1980], all india rent cases 3i9.
brief facts of that case are therefore stated below showing how the said question arose.
it may be mentioned that the allahabad high court reiterated the same view later in the case of lekh raj vs 4th addl.
distt.
judge, meerut, air 1982 all 265.
jhansi is a cantonment in uttar pradesh.
brij sunder kapoor, the appellant is a tenant of premises no. 103, sadar bazar, jhansi of which respondent no. 3 bhagwan das gupta is the landlord.
in 1975, the landlord filed an application before the prescribed authority under section 21 of the act praying that he required the premises for his personal occupation and that the same be released to him.
the appellant tenant contested the application.
the application was dismissed by the prescribed authority but, on appeal by the landlord, it was allowed by the additional district judge.
the tenant thereupon filed a writ petition which was dismissed by a single judge of the high court of allahabad.
the appellant tenant has therefore filed this appeal.
in order to judge the legality of the point urged regarding applicability of the act to cantonment area in pg no 559 u.p., the court first referred to the history of tenancy legislation in the state of u.p. where the rent and eviction control legislation was initiated by the united provinces (temporary) control of rent and eviction ordinance promulgated on 1.10.1946, followed by u.p. act iii of 1947 which was made retrospective w.e.f. 1.10.1946.
both the act and the ordinance applied to cantonment area.
by a later act u.p. (amendment) act 44 of 1948, cantonment areas were excluded from the purview of act iii of 1947 perhaps in view of cantonments (house accommodation) act, 1923.
consequent upon the receipt of various representations demanding the applicability of act iii of 1947 to cantonment area, the state promulgated ordinance 5 of 1949, which, however, was allowed to lapse.
in the meantime the allahabad high court in smt.
ahmedi begum vs distt.
magistrate, ruled that the state legislature was in competent to regulate accommodation lying in cantonments since that was a subject in which parliament alone was competent to legislate.
this view was later approved by this court in inder bhushan bose vs rama sundari devi.
; thereupon, parliament enacted the u.p. cantonments (control of rent and eviction act 1952) (act 10 of 1952).
in 1957 parliament enacted the cantonments (extension of rent control laws) act, of 1972 gave it retrospective operation from 26.1.1950 which provided for extension to contonments of state law relating to control of rent and regulation of house accommodation.
as a consequence of this, act iii of 1947 became applicable to the cantonment area, even though act 10 of 1952 was in force.
in order to avoid any complication u.p. cantonments (control of rent and eviction) repeal act 1971 was enacted.
a notification under section 3 of act 46 of 1957 extending act iii of 1947 to cantonments in u.p. was issued in 3.4.1972; but soon thereafter act iii of 1947 was repealed by u.p. act 13 of 1972 which came into operation on 15.7.1972 which necessitated the issuance of another notification under section 3 of act 46 of 1957 extending the provisions of act 13 of 1972.
accordingly, a notification dated 1.9.1973 was issued.
it was in view of this notification that respondent no. 3 filed his application under section 21 of the act, which has given rise to these proceedings.
counsel for the appellants raised three principal contentions viz: (1) whether act 46 of 1957 applied at all to the state of u.p. in view of act 10 of 1952 which contained special provisions applicable to cantonments in the state of u.p. (ii) did not the power of the central government under section 3 of act 46 of 1957 get exhausted when the pg no 560 notification dated 3rd april, 1972 was issued, by which provisions of act iii of 1947 were extended to cantonments in u.p.
if yes, was not the second notification dated 1.9.1973 illegal and non est on that account? (iii) does not section 3 of act 46 of 1957 suffer from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative powers and is it not consequently void and inoperative? dismissing the appeals, this court, held: once it is the avowed policy of parliament that cantonment areas in a state should be subjected to the same tenancy legislation as the other areas therein, it follows that the decision involves also that future amendments in such state legislation should become effective in cantonment area as well.
in some rare cases where parliament feels that such subsequent amendments need not apply to cantonment areas or should apply with more than the limited restrictions and modifications permitted by section 3, it is open to parliament to legislate independently for such cantonment areas.
but the decision that in the main, such state legislation should apply is unexceptionable and cannot be said to constitute an abdication of its legislative function by parliament.
[585g h; 586a] amended section 3 of act xlvi of 1957, on a proper construction, validly empowers the central government, by notification, to extend the provisions of act 13 of 1972 to the cantonments in the state of uttar pradesh, not only in the form in which it stood on the date of the said notification but also along with its subsequent amendments.
[589d e] act 10 of 1952 was a detailed statute, which was applicable to cantonments in the state of u.p. [566c] parliamentary legislation act 68 of 1971 terminates the applicability of act 10 of 1952 in uttar pradesh cantonments.
[567b] it enacts that act 10 of 1952 shall stand repealed in its application to the state of u.p. on and from the date on which act iii of 1947 was extended to the cantonment areas in the state by a notification under section 3 of act xlvi of 1957.
[567e] a notification was issued on 3.4.1972 under section 3 of act xlvi of 1957, extending the provisions of act iii of 1947, with certain modification set out therein, to pg no 561 cantonments in the state of uttar pradesh.
on and from 3rd april, 1972, therefore, act 10 of 1952 ceased to apply to cantonments in the state of uttar pradesh.
[566e f] in view of this, there was, at least on and after that date, no obstacle in the way of act iii of 1947 being operative in the cantonments of the state of u.p. as well.
[566f] the provisions of act 68 of 1971 have rendered act 10 of 1952 inoperative as and from 3.4.1972 leaving the provisions of act i11 of 1947 in the field only until it was replaced by act 13 of 1972.
[567c] notification dated 1.9.1973 extended to the cantonment areas only the provisions of act xiii of 1972 as they stood in that date.
it was only 17.2.1982 that a further notification was issued superseding the notifi cation dated 1.9.1973 by which the provisions of act xiii of 1972 as in force in the state of uttar pradesh were also extended to the cantonment areas.
the purpose of this notification obviously was that, since there had been amendments to act xiii of 1972 in 1974 and again in 1976, it was necessary and desirable that the amended provisions should also be extended to the cantonment areas.
[573d e] gurcharan singh & ors.
vs v. k. kaushal, ; the delegation of a power to extend even future laws of another state will not be bad so long as they are laws which are already in force in the said areas and so long as, in the process and under the character of the law or a change of it in essential particulars is not permitted.
