the appellant supported his brother and his nephew for a number of years as they were doing no work.
in the year 1943 he made a gift of rs. 7,60,000 odd to them though he had to overdraw his account with the bank and to pay interest or the amount borrowed to raise the money.
he also made a transfer of some of his businesses to them.
his explanation was that these gifts were made to set these two persons up in business.
the income tax officer held that the gifts were riot bonafide and he assessed, the income of all the businesses in the hands of the appellant.
the appellant had produced letters from some businessmen in support of his case.
one such person was one m. who was examined by the income tax officer without notice to the appellant.
later, however, a copy of the statement of m. was taken by the appellant 's counsel and at his request m. was summoned for cross examination but on the date fixed none appeared for the appellant who was also absent.
the appellant made a petition under section 66(1) of the income tax act to the tribunal asking that a number of questions of law be referred to the high court.
only one question was referred by the tribunal which declined to refer the other questions.
in the high court the question referred by the tribunal was answered against the appellant on the admission of his counsel.
the high court was moved also under section 66(2) to order a reference of the remaining questions but the high court rejected the application.
the appellant did not appeal against these two orders of the high court and instead filed appeals against the orders of the tribunal.

there can be no direct appeal to the supreme court by passing the decisions of the high court.
