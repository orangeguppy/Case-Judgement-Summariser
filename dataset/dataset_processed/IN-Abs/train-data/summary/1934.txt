the first appellant, who was the mutawalli of a public trust, filed a representative suit for an injunction restraining the respondent from committing acts of encroachment on the suit property, on the ground that the property was that of the trust and had been so registered by the registrar of public trusts, under the madhya pradesh public trusts act, 1951.
the suit was dismissed by the trial court and also on appeal.
in their appeal to the supreme court the appellants contended that, since the respondent did not avail itself of the ,right to file a suit within the specified time, the order passed by the registrar must be held to be final and conclusive against the respondent.
held: the fact that the property in suit was added to the list of the properties belonging to the trust, could not affect the respondent 's title to it.
[306 a b] the enquiry which the act contemplates is an enquiry into the question as to whether a trust is public or private and does not take within its sweep questions as to whether a property belongs to a private individual and is not the subject matter of any trust at all.
the only persons who are required to file their objections in proceedings before the registrar are persons interested in the public trust not persons who dispute the existence of the trust or who challenge the allegation that any property belongs to the said trust.
inasmuch as the respondent was not a party to the proceedings and could not have filed any objections in the proceedings the respondent was not bound to file an appeal under section 4(5) of the act or a suit under section 8(1), challenging order of the registrar.
therefore, the finality given to the finding of the registrar could not be availed of by the appellant as against the respondent.
