the appellants purchased certain lands in the state of punjab and the respondents filed a suit claiming a right of preemption thereon.
under a scheme of consolidation, however, the appellants had before the filing of the suit, been allotted some other lands in lieu of the lands purchased by them, and they contended that the right of pre emption claimed by the respondents did not extend to these lands.
the trial court and the high court decreed the respondents ' suit holding on the oasis of section 24 of the patiala and east punjab states union holdings (consolidation and prevention of fragmentation) act 5 of 2007 bk that it was open to pre emptor to follow the land which had been given to the vendees in consolidation proceedings in lieu of the land which was the subject matter of the sale deed.
the appellants came to this court by special leave.
held : section 24 when it says that the landowner or the tenant at will shall have the same right in the land allotted to him as he bad in his original holding or tenancy clearly preserves the obligation that may be on the land in the nature of a disability.
the consequence therefore is that the ordinary law of pre emption under which the pre emptor his the right to follow the land which is the subject matter of the sale deed becomes expanded and the land allotted to the landlord and tenant at will in lieu of the land which may have been subject to pre emption also becomes subject to pre emption in the same way as the original holding or the tenancy.
this inference is not negatived by the special provisions of section 25 in respect of leases and mortgages or other encumbrances.
