by a deed dated march 5, 1951, the appellant made a declaration of trust in favour of hiswife as follows: "i hereby declare that i hold 244 sharesupon trust to pay the income thereof to my wifefor a period of seven years from the date hereof or her death (whichever event may be earlier) and i hereby declare that this trust shall not be revocable".
in the year of account, 1951, a sum of rs. 30,404 was received as dividend income on those shares and the appellant claimed before the income tax authorities that this sum was not liable to be included in his total income in view of the third proviso to section 16(1)(c) of the indian income tax act, 1922, but this claim was rejected on the ground that the case was covered either by section 16(3)(a)(iii) or by section 16(3)(b) of the act.
the appellant 's contention was that under the deed of trust there was no transfer of assets either to the wife or to any person for the benefit of the wife but merely a creation of a trust in respect of the shares, the dividends from which were payable to the wife, that even if it be held that there was such a transfer, it was for adequate consideration being for love and affection which was a good consideration, and that thus section 16(3)(a)(iii) or section 16(3)(b) was not applicable.
held, that on a true construction of the deed dated march 15, 1951, there was a transfer of the shares by the husband to himself as a trustee for the benefit of the wife and that even though the husband was the same individual, in his capacity as a trustee he must be regarded as a person distinct from the transferor.
held, further, that the words "adequate consideration" in section 16(3) of the indian income tax act, 1922, denoted considera tion other than mere love and affection, which, in the case of a wife, may be presumed.
accordingly, the present case fell within section 16(3)(b) of the act and not within the third proviso to section 16(i)(c).
