when an application under section 35 of the act was made for ratification, whether the offerings received by the assessee consisted of interest income, property income, and income derived from sale of books and photographs etc.
to be excluded, the commissioner directed deletion thereof.
for the year 1939 40, though the income tax officer did not allow exemption u/s.4(3)(1) of the act, the appellate assistant commissioner allowed exemption.

on the question, referred to the high court by the tribunal, "whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the tribunal was justified in holding that the income derived by the radha swami satsang, a religious institution, was entitled to exemption under sections 11 and 12 of the income tax act, 1961?", the high court answered the question in favour of the revenuerespondent, holding that the trust deed was revocable and the conditions for exemption under sections 11 and 12 of the act were not satisfied.
allowing the appeals of the assessee, this court, held: 1.01.
assessments are quasi judicial.
each assess ment year being a unit, what is decided in one year may not apply in the following year but where a fundamental aspect permeating through the different assessment years has been found as a fact one way or the other and parties have al lowed that position to be sustained by not challenging the order, it would not be at all appropriate to allow the position to be changed in a subsequent year.
[320h, 321 a b] 1.02.
no formal document is necessary to create a trust.
the conditions which have to be satisfied to entitled one for exemption are: (a) the property from which the income is derived should be held under trust or legal obli gation, (b) the property should be so held for charitable or religious purposes which enure for the benefit of the pub lic.
[317 e g] 1.03.
the property was given to the satguru for the common purpose of furthering the objects of the sat guru.
the property was therefore subject to a legal liability of being used for the religious or charitable purpose of the satsang.
[319 e, f] 1.04.
the tribunal was justified in holding that the income derived by the radhasoami satsang was entitled to exemption under sections 11 and 12 of the income tax act, 1961.
