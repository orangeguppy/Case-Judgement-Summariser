the father of the first respondent sold his lands to the second respondent but continued to be in possession.
the second respondent sold them to the appellants who were put in possession in 1934.
in august 1945, the first respondent filed a petition against the second respondent, before the debt adjustment board, under ss. 17, 18 and 45 of the bombay agricultural debtors relief act, 1939, within the time prescribed by section 17, alleging that the transaction with the second respondent was a mortgage and that the debt was liable to be adjusted under the act.
the first appellant was impleaded as a party to the petition in december 1945, beyond the time specified in section 17.
no appeal was filed against that order, and in 1947, the board disposed of the petition for adjustment of debt by directing the second respondent to render accounts.
he appealed and, pending the appeal, the 1939 art was repealed by the bombay agricultural debtors relief act of 1947.
in 1949, the appellate court set aside the board 's order and remanded the case to the civil judge, for deciding the nature of the transaction, because, under the 1947 act, the board was dissolved and its jurisdiction was vested in the civil judge.
in 1950, the first respondent 's application to the civil judge for impleading the second respondent also as a party to the petition for adjustment of the debt, was allowed, and thereafter, the matter was disposed of on merits.
on the questions: (i) whether the orders impleading the appellants were without jurisdiction.
and (ii) whether the appellants had acquired title to the lands by adverse possession, held: (i) the orders were not without jurisdiction.
under the repealed act, if a party was added beyond the period prescribed under section 17 of the act, if he was added as a necessary party to a petition filed in time, the said order might be improper but not without jurisdiction.
[151 c d] under section 56 of the 1947 act, original and appellate proceedings initiated under the repealed act but pending at the time the 1947 act came into force will have to be disposed of in accordance with the substantive and procedural sections of the 1947 act.
under section 46 of the 1947 act, the court is empowered.
in a suitable case, to add parties under 0.1, r. 10, civil procedure code, and they may be added irrespective of the time limit prescribed under the repealed act, or the time specified in ss. 4 and 24 of the 1947 act.
[152 a c] case law referred to.
(ii) the appellants had not acquired any title by adverse possession, as the petition for adjustment of debt was filed within 12 years from the date of their occupation of the suit lands.
