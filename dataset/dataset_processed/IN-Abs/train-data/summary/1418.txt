the government of uttar pradesh under section 3 of the u.p. , and the statutory orders framed thereunder referred certain.
disputes between the respondent ice factories and the respective workmen to an industrial tribunal.
the tribunal heard the matters but failed to pronounce its award in open court, as required under the clause 9 (7) of the statutory orders.
instead the registrar of the tribunal informed the ice factories that the award of the tribunal had been submitted to the government.
the award was published in the u.p. gazette and the regional conciliation officer called upon the ice factories to implement the award immediately.
the ice factories moved the high court at allahabad alleging that the award was a nullity as it had not been pronounced in open court as required under the clause 9 (7) of the statutory orders and asking for writs to quash it.
high court issued the writs quashing the notification publishing the award.
the questions are whether the provisions of sub cl.
(7) of cl. 9 of the statutory orders are imperative or merely directory and whether that sub clause is ultra vires as being in conflict with the act under which it had been framed.
held, that the clear intention of the legislature is to make it imperative that judgments should be pronounced in open court by the tribunal and a judgment not so pronounced would therefore be a nullity.
the provision in sub cl.(7) of cl. 9 of the statutory order is imperative and not directory.
held, further, that the provisions as to the pronouncement of the decision in open court contained in cl. 9 (7) of the statutory order was clearly within the powers contemplated in section 3 (g) of the act and section 6 of the act does not prohibit the making of such provisions.
a rule duly framed under the act requiring the tribunal to pronounce its decision in open court is therefore not in conflict with section 6 of the act.
