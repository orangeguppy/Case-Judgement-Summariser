the deputy commissioner of amraoti, evolved a scheme for the distribution of standard cloth.
the assessees agreed to finance the scheme without charging any interest and were appointed financiers and distributors.
the orders for the cloth were placed by the government with the mills and the cloth was delivered to the assessees upon their paying the value of the cloth together with 6 1/4% of the ex mill price.
the deputy commissioner paid 4 1/2% of the ex mill price to the asses sees for contingent expenses of working the scheme.
the assessees distributed the cloth at prices fixed by the deputy commissioner through the tehsildars and the deputy commissioner was responsible to the assessees for the sale proceeds receivable from the tehsildars.
out of the sale proceeds the deputy commissioner paid to the assessees whatever they had advanced on the cloth.
the profits from the scheme were agreed to be utilised for such charitable purposes as might be decided by the deputy commissioner.
the assessees contended that the income was not their income and that it was exempt from taxation under section 4(3) (i a) of the income tax act.
held, that the profits were income which accrued to the assessees.
the assessees worked the scheme and such working produced the profits.
the fact of the control of the deputy commissioner could not prevent the working of the scheme by the assessees from being a business carried on by them.
the provisions in the agreement that the deputy commissioner guaranteed the payment by the tehsildars of the price due from them, and that the profits would be devoted to charity decided by the deputy commissioner and the claim for exemption under section 4(3) (i a) all indicated that the assessees were the owners of the business.
held further, that the profits were not exempt from taxation under section 4(3) (i a), as the business was not carried on behalf of any religious or charitable institution.
