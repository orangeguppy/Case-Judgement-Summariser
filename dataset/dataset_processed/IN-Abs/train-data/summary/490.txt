the respondent was a company carrying on life, fire, marine and general insurance business, and the question for determination related to the assessment of excess profits tax on its income other than life insurance.
the method adopted by the company with respect to fire insurance policies was that while the premiums received were all of them included in the assets of the year, a portion thereof, 40 per cent., was treated as reserve for unexpired risks on the outstanding policies, and shown as a liability.
the appellant, the commissioner for excess profits tax, claimed that the sum set apart as reserve for unexpired risks was liable to be deducted under r. 2 of sch.
ii of the excess profits tax act, 1940, from out of the capital employed in business for that year.
the respondent, while maintaining that all the premiums received must be treated as capital under r. 1 of sch.
ii to the act, contended that the provision for unexpired risks was only a contingent liability and that a liability under a contract of insurance where under risk had not materialised could not be held to be a debt and was therefore not an accruing liability within r. 2 of sch.
ii to the act.
held, that the reserve liability for unexpired risk, unlike borrowed money and debts, cannot be treated as part of the real trading assets of the business so as to have an effect on the running of the business or the earning of profits, and consequently, as it cannot be included as capital under r. i, it cannot be deducted as an accruing liability within r. 2 of sch.
ii of the excess profits tax act, 1940.
