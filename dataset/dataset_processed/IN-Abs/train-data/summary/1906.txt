(ii)in specifying castes, races or tribes under article 341 of the constitution, the president has been expressly authorised to limit the notification to parts of or groups within the castes, race or tribe, the president may well come to the conclusion that not the whole caste, race or tribe but parts of or groups within them should be specified.
similarly the president can specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire state, but in relation to the parts of the state where he is satisfied that the examination of the social and educational backwardness of the race, caste or tribe justifies such specification.
