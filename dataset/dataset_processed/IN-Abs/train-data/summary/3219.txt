in 1950, the respondent had executed three trust deeds for the benefit of three ladies who were described as his wives, and himself, as the father of their minor children.
after the returns in respect of the assessment year 1955 56, 1956 57, 1957 58 and 1958 59 were filed by the respondent, the income tax officer, who had the three trust deeds before him called upon the respondent for information regarding his relationship to those three ladies as well as his relationship to a fourth lady.
a statement was filed, on behalf of the respondent, before the income tax officer, wherein it was stated that only the fourth lady was his legally wedded wife, that the other three were merely referred to as the wives, and that their children were not the legitimate children of the respondent.
the income tax officer, in assessing the total income of the respondent did not include, under section 16(3) of the 1922 act, the income of those three ladies and their minor children arising out of the trust properties.
in fact, he assessed them separately with respect to their income from the trust properties.
in 1964 the income tax officer issued notices under section 148 of the 1961 act seeking to reopen the assessments under section 147 on the ground that there were two other trust deeds of 1957, which were not produced before the i. t. 0.
in which also two of the ladies were acknowledged as the wives of the respondent and their children as his children and that their marriage should be presumed because of the acknowledgement.
the respondent there upon challenged the validity of the proceedings and the high court allowed his petition.
dismissing the appeal to this court, held : (1) section 147(a) provides that if the income tax officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for any year, income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year, he may assess or reassess such income for the assessment year concerned.
the fact that the ladies and their children had been described in the 1957 documents as wives and children of the respondent would have been material if the description were any thing new that the income tax officer happened to discover for the first time.
but the 1950,deeds also contained the same description.
the non production of the 1957 documents at the time of the original assessment cannot therefore be regarded as non disclosure of any material fact necessary for the assessment of the respondent for the relevant assessment years.
having second thoughts on the same material does not warrant the initiation of a proceeding under section 147.
[467g h; 468b; d e] (2) the law has not changed or since the original assessments were made and it was open to the income tax officer to have made the presumption that the ladies were the wives at the time when he made the assessment.
he cannot avail of section 147 to correct his mistake.
[468f g] (3) the expression 'reason to believe ' occurring in section 147 of the 1961 act or the corresponding section 34 of the 1922 act, does not mean a purely subjective satisfaction on the part of the income tax officer.
the reasons for the belief must have a rational connection or relevant bearing to the formation of the belief.
therefore, the high court, under article 226, has power to set aside a notice under section 147 of the 1961 act or section 34 of the 1922 act, if the condition precedent to the exercise of the .jurisdiction under those sections did not exist.
