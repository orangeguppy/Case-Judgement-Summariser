(c) even if the note is treated as an executive instruction and not part of the rule itself, there is no reason why the authority should not follow the note.
the authority would still have a discretion in the matter.
in the present case, the question involved was a simple one whether he had taken money from the 40 proprietor of the german firm.
no prejudice was caused to the appellant, because the proprietor was only a lawyer in name but was actively in business and the services of a professional lawyer were not necessary to cross examine him.
[51 b] (d) the appellant wanted an officer from india to assist him in the conduct of his defence.
under the rule, he was not entitled, as a matter of right, to have the services of any railway officer stationed in india.
he was in fact given a choice to choose either one stationed in london or on the continent.
