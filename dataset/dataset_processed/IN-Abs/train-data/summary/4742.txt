after considering the objections and representations against the inclusion of ektaji village in the municipal limit and after following once again the other statutory requirement of further notice etc.
, the state government published in the orissa gazette dated 12.8.1975 a notification approving the inclusion.

it is true that when a duly constituted grama under sub section (i) of section 3 of the grama.
panchayat act is to go out of existence an order of the magistrate cancelling the notification in terms of sub section (2) of section 3 of the said act is a pre requisite.
but in the instant case the gram panchayat never challenged the notification of inclusion of the village ektaji in jharsuguda ' municipality.
rather on the other hand the gram panchayat was consulted before the impugned notification dated 12th august 1975 was issued.
[406 h; 407 a] 4.
the proviso to sub section 1 of section 4 of the orissa municipal.
act, 1950 has no application to the present case and that cannot be taken to be a ground for challenging the notification for inclusion of village ektaji hl the jharsuguda municipality.
a bare perusal of the proviso clearly indicates that the requirement is that two thirds of the adult, male population of the town to which it refers should be engaged in non agricultural pursuits the proviso applies not to all the clauses of sub section (i) of section 4 but it.
applies only to clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 4, because it is clause (a) of section 4 (1) which talks of town.

there is a statutory presumption under section 392 of the orissa municipal act, 1950 that the publication of the rules or regulations or bye laws in the gazette shall be evidence that the rule pr regulation or bye law has, been mad as required by the section therefore the court will assume that the bye law has been made in accordance with law in the absence of anything more from the site of the appellant.
