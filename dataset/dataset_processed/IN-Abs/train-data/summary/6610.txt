some employees appointed before 6.12.1972 challenged the notification dated 6.12.1972.

brijlal vs rajasthan state electricity board, [1979] wln (uc) 221, referred to.
during this period, the state electricity board in exercise of the powers conferred by section 79, sub section (c) and (k) of the made regulations which are cared rajasthan state 278 electricity board employees (emoluments) regulations, 1978.
these regulations were made applicable retrospectively from 1st april, 1974.
under these regulations, post of meter reader ii/meter checker ii was mentioned in scale no. 2.
in 1979, an arbitration award was given between the board and the union under which two categories of meter readers/meter checkers were again made.
subsequently, 35 employees appointed between the period 197279 filed the present writ petitions in the high court.
the stand taken by these employees was that the notification dated 6.12.1972 had already been quashed by the high court and as such they were to be governed by the first settlement dated february 22, 1972 in which there was only one category of meter reader/meter checker to whom pay scale no. 3 had been given and as such they were also entitled to pay scale no. 3.
the high court allowed the writ petitions and granted pay scale no. 3 to all the petitioners.
the division bench dismissed the special appeal of the board.
the board has now come before this court against such employees who were appointed after 1.4.1974.
the contentions of the board before this court were that (i) even if for arguments ' sake the earlier decision given by the high court may be considered as final, that was in respect of the employees who were appointed before 6th december, 1972; (ii) as regards the present employees no benefit could be granted in their case as the first settle ment itself was to remain in force upto 31st march, 1974; (iii) in any case in the appointment orders of the respond ents it was clearly mentioned that they were appointed as meter reader/meter checkers gr.
ii in the pay scale no. 2; and (iv) under the rajasthan state electricity employees (emoluments) regulations 1978, which were made applicable from 1st april, 1974 meter reader ii/meter checker ii have been placed in pay scale no. 2 and meter reader i/meter checker i have been placed in pay scale no. 3.
on behalf of the employees respondents it was connected that (i) though according to clause ix of the first settle ment dated 22.2.1972 the settlement was to remain in force till 31st march, 1974 yet the same would remain in operation until the expiry of two months from the date on which a notice in writing of an intention to terminate the settle ment was given by one of the parties to the other party or parties to the settlement as provided under sub section (2) of section 19 of the ; (ii) that an arbitration award was given in 1979 279 between the board and the employees federation under which two categories of meter readers/meter checkers were again made and hence all the meter readers appointed upto 1979 before the arbitration award were entitled to scale no. 3, and (iii) the contention with regard to the first settlement having come to an end on march 31, 1974 as well as the contention raised on the basis of regulations were rightly negatived by the division bench of the high court as these points were not taken in the writ petitions and were not argued before the learned single judge.
allowing the appeals, this court, held: (1) the respondents/employees in the present case want to take advantage of the first settlement simply on the ground that it did not make any mention of meter reader/meter checker gr.
i or ii and it simply made mention of meter reader/meter checker to whom pay scale no. 3 was given.
the above ambiguity was clarified by an agreement between the board and the union representing the employees as early as on 2.12.1972 itself to the effect that meter reader/meter checker could be placed in two different grades.
after this there was no restriction on the board to make appointment of the meter reader/ meter checker in grade ii after 1.4.1974.
[290b c] (2) there was clear mention in the appointment orders of the respondents that they were appointed as meter readers/meter checkers gr.
ii in pay scales no. 2.
learned counsel for the respondents/employees were unable to show that the board had no power to make such appointments of the meter reader/meter checker in gr.
[290d] (3) the board had already taken the stand that the first settlement was clarified by the second settlement and as such even if the high court had quashed the second settle ment, it was at least a sufficient notice within the meaning of section 19(2) of the that the board had terminated the first settlement after 31.3.1974.
