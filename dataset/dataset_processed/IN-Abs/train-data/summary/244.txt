the provisions regarding search and seizure by the indian police are contained in sections 51 , 96, 98 and 165 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898.
none of these sections had any application to the facts and circumstances of the case.
any seizure by the indian police of any property of a citizen not sanctioned under the law stated above or under any other law infringes the fundamental rights of the citizen guaranteed under article 19 and article 31 of the constitution of india.
this position is not affected even if the citizen whose goods are so seized files an application under section 623 of the code and his application is dismissed by the magistrate.
in view of the provisions of article 370 it is doubtful if an offence committed in jammu and kashmir could be investigated by the police in india.
