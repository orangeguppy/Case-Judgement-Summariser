subsequent to an order made for the winding up of a company, the company judge made a direction for action to be taken under provisions of section 153 of the indian companies at the meeting of the unsecured creditors of the company a resolution was passed by the creditors present, either in person or through proxy, by majority in number as well as three fourths in value.
at this meeting the appellant claiming to represent two of the creditor companies cast his votes on behalf of the said companies in support of the resolution.
no objection was taken at the meeting to the validity of the votes by any of the creditors who opposed the resolution.
when the matter came up for orders before the company judge an objection was raised that the votes cast by the appellant on behalf of the two creditor companies were not valid, inasmuch as section 153(2) of the act requires that the creditors should be present either in person or by proxy at the meeting and that, in the present case, the two creditor companies, being corporations, could not be considered to have been present at the meeting "in person".
the company judge overruled the objection on the grounds that it was raised at a late stage and that, in any case, the votes were valid because the appellant 's attendance at the meeting amounted to the attendance of the companies "in person".
on appeal, a division bench of the patna high court rejected the contention that no appeal lay to the high court from the order of the company judge but only to the supreme court and, on the merits, set aside his order. ^ held, that: (1) the word "court" in section 153(7) of the indian companies act, 1913, means the court exercising original jurisdiction, and.
therefore, an appeal from the order of the company judge lay to the high court under cl. 10 of the letters patent; (2) though under the , a company is a "person" so that whenever the word "person" is used in any statute a company would be included thereunder, unless there is some special provision by a law a company which is not a physical person cannot "be present" at any place "in person"; and (3) in the present case the votes cast by the appellant were not valid in law and it being admitted that if the votes were invalid the requisite majority of three fourths in value requisite under section 153(2) of the indian companies act, 1913, would not be obtained and therefore no further action could be taken by the court in the matter, the delay in raising the objection would not entitle the court to ignore the legal defect of the votes.
