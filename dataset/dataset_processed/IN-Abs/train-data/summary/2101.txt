the appellant sought a declaration that certain premises belonged to his family as private property and did not constitute a temple within the meaning of the madras hindu religious and charitable endowments act (19 of 1951).
the district court decreed the suit but the high court found that the property in question was a temple.
the appellant then filed a petition for leave to appeal to this court under article 133(1) (a) and (b) of the constitution and submitted that the property was more than rs. 20000 in value.
the high court dismissed the application on the ground, inter alia, that the subject matter of the dispute whether as a private or a public temple was incapable of valuation as it could have in either case no market value.
the appellant by special leave came to this court.
held:the high court was not right in assuming that whether the property was a private or a public temple, it was incapable of valuation.
the subject matter of the dispute had to be ascertained with reference to the claim made by the plaintiff in his plaint and since according to the plaint the property was the private property of the appellant 's family capable of alienation, the high court ought to have valued the property accordingly.
