the respondent as principal entered into several forward contracts for the purchase and sale of bullion through the appellant 's firm at indore who worked as commission agents for the respondent.
the transactions resulted in a loss and the appellants who had to pay the amount of loss to third parties on behalf of the respondent as the agents brought the suit for recovery of the amount in the court in jodhpur where the respondent resided.
it was pleaded by the respondent that according to.
the law prevalent there as contained in the notification of the marwar government dated the 3rd june, 1943, all forward business contract in bullion in which the date fixed for delivery exceeded 12 days were 440 illegal and therefore a suit on the basis of these transactions was not maintainable.
held, that, the suit was really not one to enforce any contract relating to the purchase or sale of bullion which comes within the prohibition of the notification but was one by an agent claiming indemnity against the principal for the loss which the agent had suffered in carrying out the directions of the principal.
the right to such indemnity was founded on the statutory provision contained in section 222 of the indian contract act and the acts of payment made by the plaintiffs on behalf of the defendant were lawful acts as all the transactions took place and the payments were made outside marwar and therefore the suit was not hit by the notification.
