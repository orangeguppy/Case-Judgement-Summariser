notices under section 22(2) of the income tax act, 1922, were not complied with by the respondent (assessee) and the income tax officer issued notices under section 22(4).
since they were also not complied with the income tax officer made a best judgment assessment under section 23(4).
thereupon, the assessee applied under section 27 for reopening the assessment.
the income tax officer found that there was sufficient cause for noncompliance with the notices under section 22(4), but, as there was no sufficient cause for non compliance with the notices under section 22(2), he declined to reopen the assessment.
the order was confirmed in ' appeal and by the tribunal.
but the high court held in favour of the assessee.
in appeal to this court, held : under section 23(4) on the assessee committing any of the defaults mentioned therein, namely, failure to make a return as required by a notice under section 22(2) or a revised return under section 22(3) or noncompliance with the terms of a notice under section 22(4) or failure to comply with the terms of a notice under section 23(2), the income tax officer is bound to make a best judgment assessment.
section 27 empowers, the income tax officer to cancel the assessment when sufficient cause is shown; but, such cause has to be shown for each default.
therefore, if the assessee makes default by not filing a return pursuant to a notice under section 22(2) and also does not comply with a notice under section 22(4) he must show sufficient cause for non compliance with both the provisions.
the legislature could not have intended that in case of multiple defaults, for each one of which an ex parts best judgment assessment has to be made, the assessee can ask for cancellation of the assessment by merely showing cause for one of such defaults.
