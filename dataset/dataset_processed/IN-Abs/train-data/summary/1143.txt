a decree dated september 2, 1938, in a suit for partition of joint hindu family property awarded a house to the share of one j and his four minor sons.
j failed to execute the decree.
on november 23, 1949, an application was made by the appellants, the four sons of j, for execution of the decree stating that three of them had been minors till then and one of them was still a minor and so no question of limitation arose.
the respondent objected that the application was barred under section 7 of the indian limitation act.
the appellants contended that section 7 did not apply to a partition decree and that section 7 was no bar as j could not have given a valid discharge of the liability under the decree in view of the provisions of 0. 32 of the code of civil procedure.
held, that the application for execution was barred by limitation.
j, the managing member of the family could have given a discharge of the liability under the partition decree by accepting possession on behalf of his minor sons without their consent and so time ran against them under section 7 from the date of the decree.
order 32, rr.
6 and 7 were no bar to j giving a discharge of the liability under the decree as it was neither a case of receipt of any money or movable property nor was there any question of entering into an agreement or compromise on behalf of the minors.
