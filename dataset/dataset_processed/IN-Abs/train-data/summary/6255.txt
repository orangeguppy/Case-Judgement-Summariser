the respondent was sought to be retired compulsorily from service by an order dated august 21, 1984 on attaining the age of 55 years under rule 56 of the fundamental rules, pursuant to the screening committee 's recommendation.

he had no personal interest in the matter and there was no conflict between his personal interest and his duties as member of the screening committee.
therefore, there could not be any question of bias or malice in law.
