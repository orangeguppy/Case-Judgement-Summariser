the accused was convicted of the offence of wrongful confinement under section 342 i.p.c., and was released after due admonition under section 562(1 a), criminal procedure code.
on the question whether the latter section is concerned only with offences relating to property and was therefore not applicable in the present case, held : the clause "any offence under the indian penal code punishable with not more than two years ' imprisonment" in section 562(1 a) cr.p.c., stands by itself and indicates that all offences punishable with not more than two years ' imprisonment are capable of being dealt with under the section.
the words "any offence under the indian penal code" cannot be read ejusdem generis with the offences of theft etc.
mentioned earlier in the section.
those offences had to be specifically mentioned so as to be included in the section, because, they are offences punishable with im prisonment of more than two years.
