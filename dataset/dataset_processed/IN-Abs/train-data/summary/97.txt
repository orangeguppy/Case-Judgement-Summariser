the term "foodstuff" is ambiguous.
in one sense it has a narrow meaning and is limited to articles which are eaten as food for purposes of nutrition and nourishment and so would exclude condiments and spices such as yeast, salt, pepper, baking powder and turmeric.
in a wider sense it includes everything that goes toto the preparation of food proper (as understood in the narrow sense) to make it more palatable and digestible.
whether the term is used in a particular statute in its wider or narrower sense cannot be answered in the abstract 878 but must be answered with due regard to the background and context.
turmeric is a "foodstuff" within the meaning of cl.
(3) of the spices (forward contract prohibition) order of 1944, read with s.2 (a)of the essential supplies (temporary powers) act (xxiv of 1946).
the said order of 1944 falls within the purview of section 5 of ordinance no. xviii of 1946, which was later reenacted as act xxiv of 1946, and it is equally saved by section 17 (2) of the act.
