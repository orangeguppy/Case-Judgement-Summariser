in the constitution of india, entry 52 in list ii in seventh schedule a right to impose tax "on entry of goods into the local area for consumption, use or sale" is conferred.
the precise meaning to be given to the words "consumption" and "use" will depend upon the context in which they are used.
these words are of wide import, the word "use" being of wider import than "consumption".
[248a. 247h, 249e].
while terminal tax is a kind of octroi which is concerned only with the entry of goods in a local area irrespective of whether they would be used there or not, octrois were taxes on goods brought into the area for consumption, use or sale.
they are leviable in respect of the goods put to some use or the other in the area but only if they were meant for such use.
[248b] 4.
the word "consumption" in its primary sense means the act of consuming and in ordinary parlance means the use of an article in a way which destroys, wastes or uses up that article.
but in some leal contents the word 245 "consumption" has a wider meaning.
