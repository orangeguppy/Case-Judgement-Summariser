a large number of parts of machinery bearing railway marks, contained in bags of metal scrap booked for transport by lorry by the appellant, was seized by the railway police and the appellant was charged with an offence under section 3 of the railway stores (unlawful possession) act, 1955.
the expert on railway machinery parts certified that the goods were unactionable, suggesting that they could not have been auctioned and lawfully purchased by any third party, but in court, he gave evidence and made a categorical statement that he could not say if the articles were auctioned in the market or not.
the appellant was convicted and the conviction was confirmed by the high court.
in appeal to this court, held: before anyone can be charged with the offence under section 3, the prosecution must show that the articles in his possession are 'railway stores ' as defined in section 2, that is: (i) that the articles are the property of a railway administration (though it is not necessary to prove that they belong to any particular railway administration); and (ii) that they are used or intended to be used in the construction, operation or maintenance of a railway.
the prosecution must also show that there was cause for reasonable suspicion of the stores having been stolen or unlawfully obtained.
evidence that the goods conformed to the railway standards, or that they were new, fails short of the requisite proof, because, an article, though it is the property of a railway administration would not be "railway stores ' if the article has been discarded or rejected as useless.
since the evidence in this case did not establish that the goods were used or intended to be used in the construction, operation or maintenance of a railway the charge must fail.
