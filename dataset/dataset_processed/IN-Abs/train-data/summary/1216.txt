where the high court dismisses a writ petition under article 226 of the constitution after hearing the matter on the merits on the ground that no fundamental right was proved or contravened or that its contravention was constitutionally justified, a subsequent petition to the supreme court under article 32 of the constitution on the same facts and for the same reliefs filed by the same party would be barred by the general principle of res judicata.
there is no substance in the plea that the judgment of the high court cannot be treated as res judicata because it cannot 575 under article 226 entertain a petition under article 32 of the constitution.
citizens have ordinarily the right to invoke article 32 for appropriate relief if their fundamental rights are illegally on unconstitutionally violated and it is incorrect to say that article 32 merely gives this court a discretionary power as article 226 does to the high court.

13th e d. 644, referred to.
the binding character of judgments of courts of competent jurisdiction is in essence a part of the rule of law on which the administration of justice, so much emphasised by the constitution, is founded and a judgment of the high court under article 226 passed after a hearing on merits as aforesaid must bind the parties till set aside in appeal as provided by the constitution and cannot be circumvented by a petition under article 32.

576 consequently, (1) where the petition under article 226 is considered on the merits as a contested matter and dismissed by the high court, the decision pronounced is binding on the parties unless modified or reversed by appeal or other appropriate proceedings under the constitution; (2) where the petition under article 226 is dismissed i not on the merits but because of laches of the party applying for the writ or because an alternative remedy is available to him, such dismissal is no bar to a subsequent petition under article 32 except in cases where the facts found by the high court may themselves be relevant even under article 32; (3) where the writ petition is dismissed in limine and an order is pronounced, whether or not such dismissal is a bar must depend on the nature of the order; (4) if the petition is dismissed in limine without a speaking order, or as withdrawn, there can be no bar of res judicata.
