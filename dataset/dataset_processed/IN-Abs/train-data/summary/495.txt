the respondent company was the managing agent of two other companies holding certain shares therein.
d wrote two letters to the respondent on september 14, 1946, offering to purchase some of those shares together with the managing agency and agreeing to pay certain sums as earnest money on the acceptance of the offer and to pay the balance after the transfer of the managing agency was sanctioned by the general body of shareholders.
by a letter dated september 30, 1946, the respondent accepted the offer on condition of a sum of rs. 1 crore being paid out of the consideration as compensation for the loss of the managing agency, and on receipt of the letter, d paid the earnest money.
subsequently, d wrote a letter on october 7, 1946, whereby, in modification of the arrangement previously made, it was agreed that instead of the managing agency being transferred by the respondent, the latter would resign the office of managing agents and certain individuals would be appointed directors of the two companies.
accordingly, the respondent relinquished the managing agency and thereupon the balance of consideration money was paid to it.
the income tax officer considered that section 12b of the indian income tax act, 1922, was applicable to the transaction and on the footing that the managing agency, which was valued at rs. 1 crore, was a capital asset, he computed the capital gains at rs. 81,81,900.
the income tax appellate tribunal held that the respondent, as the owner of the shares and the managing agency, sold the shares to d and handed back the managing agency to the managed companies, and that this handing back constituted a transfer.
on a reference to the high court by the tribunal, the agreed statement of the case proceeded on the basis that the dispute between the parties was whether the transaction with regard to the managing agency resulted in capital gains and the high court held that there was neither a sale nor a transfer of the managing agency within the meaning of section 12b of the act.
on appeal to the supreme court by the commissioner of income tax, it was contended for him (1) that there was a concluded contract 1142 of sale as a result of the letters of september 14, 1946, and september 30, 1946, and a sale having taken place, the letter of october 7, 1946, merely changed the mode of performance of the contract and did not affect the true legal character of the transaction which was a sale of the managing agency, and (2) that as there was one indivisible consideration for the whole transaction, including the sale of the shares and of the managing agency, the sale of the shares having taken place and the entire consideration having been paid, there was a sale within the meaning of section 12b of the act and the transaction resulted in capital gains.
held (1) that on a true construction of the letters there was originally only an agreement to sell the shares together with the managing agency and before the sale could take place the letter of october 7, 1946, substituted a new contract, a contract of relinquishment rather than a contract of sale, so far as the managing agency was concerned, and (2) that it was not open to the appellant to go behind the agreed statement of the case and raise a question of law based on different facts and circumstances.
accordingly, the transaction in question was a relinquishment of the managing agency and was neither a sale nor a transfer within the meaning of section 12b of the indian income tax act.
