(a) of the consti tution for the purpose of preventing activities prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order, it was not a law relating to "a matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow, the state" within the meaning of the saving provisions contained in cl.
(9.) of article 19 and was therefore unconstitutional and void.

the expression "public safety" has, as a result of a long course of legislative practice acquired a well recognised meaning and may be taken to denote safety or security of the state; and, though the expression "public order" is wide enough to cover small disturbances of the peace which do not jeopardise the security of the state yet, prominence given in the act to public safety, the fact that the act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the aim and scope of the act in gener al, show that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the act, and "public order" may well be para phrased in the context as "public tranquillity".
public disorders which disturb the public tranquillity do undermine the security of the state and as section 7 (1) (c) of the im pugned act is aimed at preventing such disorders it is difficult to hold that it falls outside the ambit of article 19 (2) of the constitution.
