certain cooperative housing societies comprising of the petitioners and others had acquired lands in the trans jamuna area of uttar pradesh prior to the setting up of the new okhla industrial development authority in 1976.
when the said lands came to be notified for the development authority writ petitions were filed in 1983 under article 32 of the constitution for quashing the acquisition.
in its order dated january 14, 1985 the court had directed the authority to hand over actual possession of plots to allottees in volved in the dispute.
since a dispute had arisen as to the eligibility of a large number of applicants who had failed to keep to the time schedule in the matter of payment the court in its interim order dated september 2, 1983 had directed the authority to reserve 269 acres of land in addition to the land already allotted.
the petitioners in the instant case belong to this category.
the total number of persons entitled to allotment has been determined at 2,380.
the authority 's scheme for the petitioners had stipulated four sizes of plots viz. 112.5 sq. metres, 162 sq. metres, 202.5 sq. metres and 250 sq. metres.
they, therefore, claimed an area of 130 acres out of the 269 acres set apart for them.
the authority, however, sought to reduce this area to 90 acres and the plot area to 77.73, 112.3, 140.45 and 173.53 sq. metres respectively.
disposing of the petitions, the court.
held: if the scaling down from 130 acres to 90 acres is to be done the plots are bound to be of odd sizes and work ing out may be difficult.
therefore, instead of 90 acres of land the total area to be released on that account should be 96.29 acres and the different sizes of plots as provided in the scheme shall stand reduced to 100 sq. metres, 326 130 sq. metres, 150 sq. metres and 180 sq. metres respec tively.
71 decimals of land should also be set apart for the other applicants being dealt with separately.
the plots are to be developed by the authority in accordance with the norms laid down, and allotted within a period of nine months beginning from 1st of march, 1990.
[329h 330f, 331f] prices have gone up in every sphere.
to bind the author ity by the terms of its scheme at this point of time would not at all be fair.
these 2,380 persons have already depos ited huge amounts of money said to be about five crores of rupees with the authority and the money has been held on account without utilisation, as no final decision had been taken.
the current rate per square metre is rs.1,200.
taking into consideration the fact that the members have waited too long for allotment of their plots, the authority should be permitted to charge rs.1,o00 per square metre.
every member who has deposited any sum of money with the authority against proposed allotment shall ble entitled to 12% inter est on such amount from the date of deposit till the actual allotment and such interest accrued in favour of the person shall be entitled to adjustment against actual price of land to be worked out @ rs. 1,000 per square metre.
balance amount, if any, shah have to be paid by every person includ ed in the figure or 2,380 within three months from the date of the order in monthly instalments.
failure to pay any of the instalments within the time limit indicated shall dis qualify such person from allotment.
the terms in regard to allotment for the remaining few persons shall also be the same.
