held : (1) that section 243 of the government of india act, 1935, 65 which was a special provision with regard to the subordinate ranks of police forces in india, excluded the operation of section 24g(3) of the act to the appellant, who was, therefore, governed by the conditions of service as provided under the police regulations, and that the substance of section 240(3) which was brought into the police regulations in september 1946 long after the appellant had been dismissed was not applicable to him.
accordingly, he was not entitled to the second notice, under section 240(3), giving him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.
