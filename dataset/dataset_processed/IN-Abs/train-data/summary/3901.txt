a dispute having been raised by the workmen, the case relating to the factory was referred under section 51 of the state act to an industrial court, while the dispute relating to the mines was referred under section 10(1) (d) of the central act to the central government industrial tribunal cum labour court.
the main question referred under the state act was whether the proposed closure was proper and justified, while the reference under the central act was whether the employers were justified in closing down the mines.
the industrial court held that it had no jurisdiction either to inquire into the propriety of the closure or to consider whether there was or was not a real closure, while the central government industrial tribunal held that though it had no jurisdiction to inquire whether the management 's decision to close down the business was proper and justified, it was entitled to consider whether, in fact, the business was closed.

the concept of 'closure ' as envisaged in section 2(8) of the state act is perhaps wider than what is commonly understood by that expression but that cannot assist the appellant to contend that under the terms of the references, the tribunals were entitled to enter into the question as to the fact of the closure.
