the respondents, manufacturers of p.v.c. conveyor belt ing, contended before the customs, excise and gold (control) tribunal that for purposes of excise duty under the central excise tariff this item fell under item 68.
the revenue submitted that the commodity was governed by item 22.
the tribunal recorded a finding of fact that p.v.c. compounding was done simultaneously with the weaving of the fabric from yarn and held that this item should be governed by the residuary entry 68 for the purposes of excise duty.
dismissing the appeals by the revenue, the court, held: it is accepted that yarn is woven into fabric.
item 19 deals with cotton fabrics while item 22 deals with man made fabrics.
the tribunal recorded a finding that p.v.c. compounding was done simultaneously with the weaving of the fabric from yarn, which clearly indicated that the process of manufacture was conversion from yarn to fabric as also the application of the p.v.c. compound carried on at the same point.
[1228f; 1227fg] in view of the higher percentage of p.v.c. compound in the commodity, it becomes difficult to treat the ultimate goods as manmade fabrics for holding that it is covered by item 22.
upon this analysis, the tribunal was correct in holding that the goods were not covered by item 22 and, therefore, the residuary item 68 applied.
