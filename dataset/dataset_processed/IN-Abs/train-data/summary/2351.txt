the appellant was a jute mill.
the industrial tribunal framed a gratuity scheme for its workers.
it was challenged by the appellant before this court in an appeal under article 136 of the constitution.
two contentions were urged, namely : (i) that the wage board was unable to recommend a gratuity scheme for the jute industry and hence there was no justi fication to frame the impugned scheme; (ii) in view of the losses incurred by the appellant during the years 1960 65, no additional burden should have been cast on it by introducing a gratuity scheme.
held : (i) the wage board 's recommendation pertained to the jute industry as a whole and not to any individual industrial unit.
it cannot be understood as recommending that there should be no gratuity scheme for the employees in any particular unit in that industry.
what was relevant to find out was whether the appellant could bear the additional burden.
[10 b] (ii) the tribunal recommended the gratuity scheme after taking into consideration the financial position of the appellant as well as the fact that in a sister concern such a scheme was in existence.
the losses suffered by the appellant were considered by the tribunal to be a passing phase.
what is of essence is the profit making capacity of the concern.
in determining that question one has to take into consideration the paid up capital of the company, its reserves, its earnings in the past and its future prospects.
a practical view of the question has to be taken.
[10 d, g] in the light of these principles and on the material placed before the tribunal it was not possible to hold that the tribunal 's conclusion was without any just basis.
