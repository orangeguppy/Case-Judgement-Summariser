the appellant was assessed to pay tax on his income for the assessment years 1945 46 and 1946 47 under section 23(3) of the income tax act, 1922.
thereafter, on june 24, 1959, the income tax officer issued a notice of reassessment under section 34 requiring the appellant to submit a return of his income assessable for the year ending march 31, 1946 on the ground that the income of the appellant had escaped assessment.
the preamble to the notice however, referred to the assessment years 1946 4 7 and 1945 46.
the appellant filed a return for the assessment year 1946 47, and when his attention was drawn to the body of the notice, he flied a fresh return for the assessment year 1945 46 admitting that he had misunderstood the notice.
on march 14, 1963 the income tax officer issued another notice under section 148 of the income tax act, 1961, calling upon the appellant to submit a return of his income for the assessment year 1946 47, on the ground that his income for that year also had escaped assessment.
the appellant, thereupon flied a writ petition in the high court for quashing the two notices dated june 24, 1959 and march 14, 1963 but the petition was dismissed.
in appeal to this court, on the questions, whether; (1 ) by the notice dated june 24, 1959 the appellant was called upon to file a return for the assessment year 1946 47 and therefore the reassessment proceedings for the assessment year 1945 46 were incompetent; and (2) since the appellant had submitted another re.turn for the assessment year 1946 47 the notice dated march 14, 1963.
, was incompetent, because a notice under section 34 of the income tax act, 1922, or section 148 of the income tax act 1961, could not be issued so long as the return was not considered and disposed of, held: (1) though there was some negligence in drawing up the preamble to the notice dated june 24, 1959 it did not affect its validity for the assessment year 1945 46.
the appellant was clearly informed that he had to file a return of his income assessable for the year ending march 31, 1946 that is for the assessment year 1945 46, and the appellant himself had admitted his mistake in construing it.
[706 b d] (2) the act does not provide any machinery for dealing with voluntary returns filed by an assessee after assessment of income for the year of assessment was completed.
when the income of the assessee had been assessed to tax, it was not open to him, to file another voluntary return and avoid the issue of a notice either under section 34 of the 1922 act or section 148 of the 1961 act.
the cases, commissioner of income tax vs ranchhoddas karsondas, and commissioner of income tax vs
section raman chettiar, 55 i.t.r. 630 (s.c.) on which the appellant relied are cases where there was no order of assessment for the rele 705 vant year and their principle has no application to the present case.
unless a notice of reassessment is issued by the income tax officer, the assessee cannot, after an order of assessment is made, submit a return of his income for the year for which he was already assessed and call upon the income tax officer to assess his income.
