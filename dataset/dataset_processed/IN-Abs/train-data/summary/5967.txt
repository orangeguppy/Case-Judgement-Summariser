the appellant joined as a lecturer in 1971, in a college affiliated to pune university in the scale of rs.300 600 prescribed by the university grants commission.
earlier, in 1967 the state government accepted in principle the govern ment of india scheme based on recommendations of the univer sity grants commission for improvement of pay scales of all university and college teachers, and issued directions to all universities in the state.
the universities in turn directed all the affiliated colleges accordingly.
the new scales were rs.300 25 600 (lecturers, junior scale), rs.400 30 640 40 800 (lecturers, senior scale) and rs.700 40 1100 (senior lecturers) and were to take effect from 1.4.1966.
the number of senior lecturers and lecturers (sr. scale) was not to exceed 1/4 of the total strength of lecturers.
again, in 1978, it was decided to implement the next report, viz, the third pay commissioner 's report which prescribed a running scale of rs.700 1600 with effect from 1.1.1973.
all the universities in the state were directed to implement the same.
a question was raised as to whether placement of teachers already made after 1.1.1973 in the pre 1973 scales would be valid on the implementation of the revised scale with effect from 1.1.1973.
the government clarified that such a placement would be valid and protect ed, subject to the prescribed conditions.
however, the pune university directed the college managements to ignore the pay scales prescribed by the earlier pay commission in case of teachers who became entitled to the higher scale after 1.1.73.
against this, the appellant and two others ap proached the high court by way of a writ petition.
however, the high court felt that there was 737 nothing very inequitable about the decision taken by the university authorities and declined to interfere.
this appeal, by special leave, is against the said judgment of the high court.
before the court, the appellant argued that the high court failed to appreciate the fact that the decision of the university authorities was highly prejudicial to the appel lant and others who were similarly situated, as it resulted in substantial monetary loss.
allowing the appeal, held: 1.
the decision of the university not only appears to be 'inequitable ' but also discriminatory inasmuch as it sought to treat equals as unequals by protecting those who had secured the placement and denying the same to others whose names the college managements had failed to forward in good time.
the appellant was entitled to placement in the higher scale of rs.700 1100 before being brought over to the revised scale of rs.700 1600.
[742b] 2.
the lecturers whose names were recommended for place ment in the higher scale before october 4, 1975 were enti tled to such placement before being brought over to the revised scale of rs.700 1600.
the appellant was entitled to placement in the higher scale of rs.700 1600 w.e.f.
june 15, 1975.
the college authorities failed, for no fault of the appellant and his companions, to forward their names to the university in the prescribed proforma for reasons best known to them.
to deny the benefit to which the appellant and his companions were entitled on account of the lapse on the part of the college authorities would be highly unfair and un just.
the high court, however took the view that there was 'nothing very inequitable ' about the decision of the univer sity to deny such placement to the appellant and his compan ions, but it is obvious that if they had been granted place ment on the due dates they would have been entitled to higher salary and allowances related to basic salary e.g. dearness allowance which is a certain percentage of basic salary, would have gone up.
[741f h; 742a] 3.
the respondents are directed to grant the benefit of placement in the higher scale of rs.700 1100 to the appel lant from the date he became entitled to the same i.e. june 15, 1975 and thereafter fix his pay revised scale of rs.700 1600.
the appellant will be entitled to the monetary benefit accruing to him on the implementation of the above 738 directive which should be worked out and paid to him within three months.
[742c d] [the court expressed the hope that the authorities will extend the same benefit also to the two companions of the appellant notwithstanding their failure to approach this court, perhaps on account of cost constraint, and not drive them to another round of litigation.] [742f]
