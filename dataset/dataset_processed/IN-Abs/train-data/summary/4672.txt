the petitioner complained that the workmen employed in the two ferries, one at bhagalpur and the other at sultanganj, operated by respondent no. 5 were not being paid minimum wages as prescribed by the relevant notifications issued by the state of bihar under the .
respondent no. 5 contended that the was not applicable to these two ferries.
allowing the writ petition, ^ held: the schedule to the lists various employments in respect of which minimum rates of wages can be fixed by the appropriate government.
entry 27 of the schedule which dealt with employment in shops and establishments registered under the bihar shops and establishments act, 1953, was amended on 25.11.1978 to enlarge its scope to cover employment in any shop or establishment other than that covered under any of the other entries in the schedule.
it is clear from the explanation to the amended entry 27 that the word "establishment" in that entry has the same meaning which is assigned to it in the bihar shops and establishments act, 1953 and the court must, therefore, look at the definition of "establishment" as given in the bihar shops and establishments act, 1953 in order to determine as to whether the bhagalpur and sultanganj ferries could be said to be establishments within the meaning of the amended entry 27.
the word "establishment" is defined in see.

the would, therefore, clearly be applicable to employment in the bhagalpur, and sultanganj ferries.
