respondent was arrested by a police constable on the ground that he was smelling of liquor.
the doctor who examined him gave evidence at the trial that though the respondent had consumed alcoholic substance he was not under the influence of liquor.
in cross examination the doctor stated that consumption of neem would produce a blood concentration of 0. 146%.
the respondent in examination under section 342 of the code of criminal procedure stated that he had not consumed prohibited alcohol but that he had consumed six ounces of neem.
he was acquitted by the magistrate.
the appellant appealed to the high court.
the main ground of appeal was that the mere statement of the respondent that he had consumed 6 ozs.
of neem was not sufficient to rebut the presumption under sub section
(2) of section 66 of the bombay prohibition act, 1949, as amended by the bombay prohibition (extension and amendment) act, 1959.
the high court dismissed the appeal in limine.
thereupon the appellant appealed to the supreme court by way of special leave on the same ground as was raised before the high court.
held, that the statement of the accused recorded under section 342 of the code of criminal procedure can be taken into consideration in judging the innocence or guilt of a person.
if the explanation given by the accused in his statement is acceptable to the court it must be held that the accused has discharged the burden under section 66 (2) of the bombay prohibi tion act.
