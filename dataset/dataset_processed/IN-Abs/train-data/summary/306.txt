a presumption of a lost grant arises in favour of a person who does not claim adversely to the owner but who on the other hand proves ancient and continued possession in assertion of a title derived from the owner without any challenge and such possession and assertion cannot be accounted for except by referring to a legal origin of the grant claimed.
but the presumption of a lost grant is not an irrebuttable presumption of law and the court cannot presume a grant where it is convinced of its non existence by reason of a legal impediment, as where the presumption of a lost grant is claimed by a fluctuating body of persons.
similarly a presumption of a lost grant cannot arise when there is no person capable of making such a grant or if the grant pleaded is illegal or beyond the powers of the grantor.
a presumption of a lost grant by way of niskar cannot be im puted to the mohunt of an asthal inasmuch as he is legally incompetent to make any niskar grant.
when a defendant who denies the title of the plaintiff in respect of any land, fails in that plea, he cannot fall back on the presumption of a lost grant from the very person whose title he has denied.
findings of fact arrived at by courts should not be vague.
