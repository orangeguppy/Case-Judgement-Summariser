prior to 1947, the respondent was in the service of the government of assam as an unarmed police constable and on partition, he opted for service pakistan.
the respondent went to the then east pakistan and joined pakistan government service as a peon.
he entered india in 1953 on the strength of a pakistani passport but returned to pakistan in 1954.
again in 1955, he obtained an indian visa which was valid upto january 26, 1955.
on the strength of that visa, he entered india but instead of returning to pakistan, he over stayed until he was detected and arrested.
he was then prosecuted under section 14 of the read with clause 7 of the foreigners order, 1948.
the additional district magistrate convicted and sentenced him and the sessions judge also upheld the said order of conviction and sentence.
in a revision application, the high court, relying on fida hussain vs u.p., ; , reversed the said order of conviction and sentence and acquitted him on the ground that he was not a 'foreigner ' under section 2(a) of the , but was a citizen of india under article 5 of the constitution; when he entered india in 1955 (before the said definition was amended in 1957.
allowing the appeal, held :(1) the respondent was a foreigner when he entered india in 1955 as the definition of 'foreigner ' then stood and by overstaying beyond the period permissible under the visa, he clearly committed breach of clause 7 of the foreigners order, 1948 and was liable to be convicted under section 14 of the .
(690b c] the crucial point in the present case, was whether the respondent had migrated to pakistan between 1947 and 1950.
if he did, then notwithstanding his complying with the requirement of article 5, his case would fall under article 7 and he would be deemed not to be a citizen even, on the date of his entry in india in 1955.
considering the facts of the present case, viz., the option exercised by the respondent for pakistan service, his having secured release from indian service, as a constable, his going to pakistan and obtaining service there as a peon, his staying there for a long period; his obtaining pakistani passport and visas declaring therein that he had acquired pakistani citizenship and domicile etc; there could be no doubt that he had gone to pakistan permanently.
his case thus fell within article 7 and therefore, at his entry in india in 1955 he was a person who was deemed not to be a citizen of india.
