section 46(2) of the indian income tax act gives authority to the collector to recover arrears of tax as if it were an arrear of land revenue.
section 48 of the madras revenue recovery act read with section 5 make it clear that the arrest of the defaulter is one of the modes by which the arrears of land revenue can be recovered, to be resorted to if the said arrears cannot be liquidated by the sale of the defaulter 's property.
such an arrest is not for any offence committed or a punishment for defaulting in any payment.
section 48 of the madras revenue recovery act does not require the collector to give the defaulter an opportunity to be heard before arresting him.
but the collector must have reason to believe that the defaulter is wilfully withholding payment or has been guilty of fraudulent conduct in order to evade payment.
such belief must be based upon some material, which a court may look into in appropriate cases, to find out if the conditions laid down in the section have been fulfilled.
the collector has also the power to release the defaulter if the amount due is paid.
