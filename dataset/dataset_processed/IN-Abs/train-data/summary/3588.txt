the trial court and the first appellate court held that the juris diction of the civil court was barred by the delhi rent control act, 1958.
however on second appeal, a single judge of the high court disturbed the findings of fact and re versed the judgments of the courts below.
dismissing the appeal by special leave the court, held: (i) there cannot be any doubt, that, in the in stant case, by deciding to set aside the concurrent findings of fact, ignoring the law laid down by this court, and, before that by the judicial committee of the privy council, the high court, patently exceeded its jurisdiction under section 100 .c.p.c. without considering the objects of the notifications or discussing any principle of construction of documents which could indicate that a point of law had really arisen for decision.

meenakshi mills, madurai vs the commissioner of income tax, madras, ; ; referred to (iv) in the instant case, it is evident that the proviso does not require the mention of anything more than the urban areas which is to be included or excluded from the limits of the municipal corporation.
that area was sufficiently clearly indicated by entries in columns 2 and 3 meant, for the revenue estate or mauza and for the colony or the vil lage.
the whole of mauza chowkri mubarakabad and the whole of onkar nagar and lekhupura were meant to be noti fied.
the mere fact that the last column was not filled up in such a manner as to show precisely where each khasra number lay did not affect the question whether the area to be included was sufficiently indicated or not.
the provi sions of section 1(2) of the delhi rent control act as wellas of section 507(a) and (b) of the delhi municipal corporation act refer only to "areas" and not to mere khasra nos.
which are convenient divisions for the purpose of indicating what lay within each area.
