for the assessment years 1948 49, 1949 50 and 1950 51, the appellant was assessed on the basis of returns filed for the turnover of each relevant previous year.
for the assessment year 1951 52, the appellant, purporting to make an election under r. 39(1) of the u.p. sales tax rules, filed returns of his turnover of the assessment year instead of the previous year.
the judge (revision) sales tax held that without the sanction of the sales tax commissioner under r. 39(2), the appellant was not entitled to do so, and the high court also, on a reference, held against the appellant.
in appeal to this court, held : the answer of the high court should have been in favour of the appellant.
[610 hi under r. 39(1), the dealer makes a choice that he will be assessed in respect of the turnover not of the previous year, which is the normal position under section 7, but in respect of the turnover of the assessment year.
rule 39(2), requiring the sanction of the sales tax commissioner covers only the, case where such election has been made under r. 39(1), that is, where the election has been made by a dealer to be assessed in respect of the turnover of the assessment year, and the dealer wishes to exercise a fresh option.
even assuming that, when a dealer submits a return in respect of the previous year under r. 40 be is treated to have elected within that rule, yet, there is no provision like r. 39 (2) which debars him from exercising the option under r. 39(1).
in the absence of an express provision like r. 39(2), general principles cannot debar an assessee from exercising a statutory right given to him.
