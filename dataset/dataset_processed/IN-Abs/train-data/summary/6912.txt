the respondents landlords filed a suit for possession of the suit premises against the appellants on the ground of default in payment of rent, amongst other, the 7th additional small causes judge, dismissed the suit holding that the service of notice dated 7 8 1980 on the defendants terminating the tenancy was not proved, even though one out of the three acknowledgments due, had been received duly signed.
as regards the question of default in payment of rent, the learned judge took the view that the case did not fall under section 12(3)(b) of the act, as the defendants had paid rs. 55,800 on 16.1.1984 and thereafter made regular payment of rs. 600 every month.
on appeal by the respondent landlords, the learned additional district judge reversed the findings of the trial court and decreed the suit.
the learned additional district judge held that when the notices are sent by registered post, it is presumed to have been served and mere denial by the tenants had no value, unless they proved some extraordinary happenings or events which prevented following of usual course of business.
on the question of default in payment of rent the learned judge held that as the defendants did not deposit the entire arrears on the first date of hearing and did not deposit the further rent during the pendency of the appeal, they persistently committed defaults during the pendency of the suit and also the appeal.
the appellants thereupon filed a writ petition in the high court challenging the validity of the aforesaid order of the learned additional district judge.
the high court dismissed the writ petition and affirmed the order passed by the learned additional district judge.
hence this appeal by the appellants, after obtaining special leave.
