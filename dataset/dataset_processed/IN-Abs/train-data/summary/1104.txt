the question for determination in the appeal was whether the union of india was entitled to levy and recover arrears of excise duty on cotton cloth for the period april 1, 1949, to march 31, 1950, payable by the respondent, a cloth mill in the state of rajasthan, under the rajasthan excise duties ordinance, 1949.
after the coming into force of the indian constitution and the extension of the central excise and salt act, 1944, and the rules framed thereunder to the state of rajasthan by section ii of the finance act of 1950, the duty in respect of cloth manufactured on and from april 1, 1950, became payable under that act.
the appellant union, however, claimed that as a result of the agreement entered into on february 25, 1950, by the president of india with the rajpramukh of rajasthan under article 278 and article 295 of the constitution, the union of india became entitled as from april 1, 1950, to claim and recover all arrears of excise duties which the state of rajasthan was entitled to recover from the respondent before the central excise and salt act, 1944, was extended to rajasthan.
notice having been accordingly served on the respondent demanding payment of the outstanding amount of rs. 1,36,551 12 as payable by it, it moved the high court under article 226 of the constitution.
on a reference by the division bench which heard the matter in the first instance, the full bench finding in favour of the respondent held that article 277 was a complete refutation of the said claim by the union and article 278 and the said agreement were overridden by it.
held, that the provisions of articles 277 and 278 of the con stitution, properly construed, leave no manner of doubt that article 277 was in the nature of a saving provision, subject in terms to the provisions of article 278, permitting the states to levy a tax or duty which, after the constitution could be levied only by the centre.
but article 277 had to yield place to any agreement in respect of such taxes and duties made between the union government and the government of a part b state under article 278.
since there could not be the least doubt in the instant case that the agreement between the president and the rajpramukh of rajasthan conceded to the union the right to levy and collect the arrears of the cotton excise duty in rajasthan, the high court was wrong in taking a contrary view of the matter.
