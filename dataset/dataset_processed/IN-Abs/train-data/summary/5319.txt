in the haryana educational service, there were two categories of teachers described as masters and basic trained teachers.
25% of the posts of masters were reserved for promotion from the posts of basic trained teachers.
masters could be promoted to higher posts.
by an order dated july 23, 1957 there was a revision of the scales of pay.
teachers were placed according to their qualifications in two categories, catetogy a consisting of b.a, b.com, b.sc.
(agriculure) and b.t., and category 'b ' consisting of four groups of whom group i was matric with basic training (including j.b.t.).
the scale of pay was linked to the qualification and for category 'a ' it was rs.110 250 with a higher start for m.a. and m.sc.
and for category 'b ' it was lower rs.60 120, middle rs.120 175 and upper rs.140 200.
while kripal singh bhatia 's case and other petitions were pending, the government of haryana issued an order further revising the scales of pay of teachers working in government schools in 1968 consequent on the acceptance of the recommendations of the kothari commission with effect from december 1, 1967.
there was, however, no departure from the principle of the 1957 order, that trained graduates would be entitled to the higher scales of pay.
on september 5, 1979, the government issued an order granting masters grade to unadjusted j.b.t. teachers who had passed b.a., b.ed.
subject to certain conditions.
this order was challenged before the high court by 'trained graduates ' i.e. those who possessed the b.ed.
or b.t. degree in addi tion to b.a. degree.
they did not possess this degree ini tially but acquired it subsequent to their joining service which was between 1953 and 1973.
the high court held that those teachers who had acquired the b.t. or b.ed.
qualifica tion subsequent to december 1, 1967 (the date on which the 1968 order came into force) 924 and before september 5, 1979 would be entitled to the higher grade but with effect from september 5, 1979 only and that those who acquired the qualification subsequent to september 5, 1979 would not be entitled to the higher grade.
it fur ther held that the 1968 order did away with the principle of the 1957 order, that teachers acquiring b.t. or b.ed.
quali fication should get the higher grade, and that a concession was shown in 1979 enabling the teachers who acquired the b.t. or b.ed.
qualification between 1968 and 1969 to get the higher scale from 1979.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
from 1957 to 1980, it was always accepted that teachers who acquired the b.t. or b.ed.
qualification would be entitled to the higher scale of pay as soon as they acquired the qualification irrespective of the dates when they were adjusted against the posts of masters.
the adjust ment against the posts of masters was relevant for the purpose of seniority in the post of masters and for the further purpose of promotion from that post.
so far as the scale of pay was concerned irrespective of adjustment against the post of masters, a teacher was always held entitled to the higher scale of pay from the date of the acquisition of the b.t. or b.ed.
qualification.
[930e g] 2.
it is plain that the high court has ignored all the events that took place between 1957 and 1980.
the principle that pay should be linked to qualification was accepted by the punjab government in 1957 and when kirpal singh bhatia 's case was argued in the high court and this court there was not the slightest whisper that the principle had been de parted from in the 1968 order.
in fact the 1968 order ex pressly stated that the government had accepted the kothari commission 's report in regard to the scales of pay and the main feature of the report with regard to pay was the link ing of pay to qualification.
the high court was not justi fied in departing from rule which had been well established and consistently acted upon, it was not open to the state government to act upon the principle in some cases and depart from it in other cases.
[931e g; 932b] 3.
the 1968 order must be read in the light of the 1957 order and the report of the kothari commission which was accepted.
if so read there could be no doubt that the gov ernment never intended to retract from the principle that teachers acquiring the b.t. or b.ed.
qualification would be entitled to the higher grade with effect from the respective dates of their acquiring the qualification.
the 1979 order was indeed superfluous.
there was no need for any special sanction for the grant of 925 master 's grade to unadjusted j.b.t. teachers, who had passed b.a., b.ed.
that was already the position which obtained both as a result of 1957 and 1968 orders and the several judgments of the court.
[931g h; 932a b] (the respondents directed to give the higher grade admissible to masters to all the teachers who have acquired the b.t/b.ed.
qualification with effect from the respective dates of their acquiring the qualification).
