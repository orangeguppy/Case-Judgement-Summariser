the appellant company was incorporated as an investment company which by its memorandum of association enabled it, inter alia, to deal in investments and properties.
for the purposes of assessment to income tax the appellant claimed, for the assessment year in question, to be treated as an investor and not as a ,dealer on the ground that it did not carry on any business in the purchase or sale of shares, securities or properties.
the incometax appellate tribunal held that according to the company 's memorandum of association and its own assertions made all along in the past, it should be treated as a dealer in investments and properties and that its income arising from the sales of shares and properties should be taxed as business profits.
the appellant 's applications for a reference to the high court were rejected on the ground that no question of law arose out of the order of the tribunal.
held, that the question whether the appellant 's business amounted to dealing in shares and properties or to investment, is a mixed question of law and fact and that the legal effect of the facts found by the tribunal as a result of which the appellant could be treated as a dealer or an investor, is a question of law.
accordingly, the order of the high court was set aside and the case remitted to the high court for directing the tribunal to state a case.
