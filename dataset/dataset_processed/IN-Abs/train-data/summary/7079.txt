on may 27, 1978, the petitioner entered into an arbitration agreement under which he had to execute a certain work within 9 months.
he averred that he had sent his bills on july 12, 1979, but payment was not made.
on november 28, 1989, for the first time he sent a notice to the respondent for reference to arbitration.
the respondent approached the high court under ss. 5,12 and 33 of the .
a learned single judge held that the claim was hopelessly barred by limitation, and cancelled the arbitration agreement.
a division bench dismissed the appeal.
on appeal, this court addressed itself to 2 questions: whether the high court could permit a party to rescind an arbitration agreement; and whether delay can be a ground for rescinding such agreement.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held:1.

the claim in the case on hand is undoubtedly hope lessly barred by limitation as the petitioner by his conduct slept over his right for more than 10 years.
