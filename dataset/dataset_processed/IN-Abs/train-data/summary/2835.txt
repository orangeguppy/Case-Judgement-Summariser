the assessee was a public limited company doing business as a dealer in diverse commodities and also in stocks and shares.
in the year of account 1949 the company suffered loss in the sale of shares of public limited companies.
in proceedings for assessment for the year 1950 51 the income tax officer declined to take into account the loss suffered.
in his view if the loss be taken as a trading loss it could not be set off against the business income of the assessee because the loss resulted from transactions in shares which constituted a business distinct from the business in other commodities.
on the question whether the loss could be taken into account and the set off given under section 24(2) of the indian income tax act, 1922 in force in the year of assessment; this court, held : the assessee was entitled to the set off.
section 24(2) of the indian income tax act, 1922 in force in the relevant year of assessment, contemplated that the loss which could not be wholly set off against the other income under sub section
(1) could be carried forward to the following year and set off only against the profits and gains, if any, from the same business.
a fairly adequate test for deter mining whether the two constitute the same business is 'was there any inter connection, any interlacing, any inter dependence, any unity ' at all embracing those two business ? ' [385 h, 386 a d] applying this test in the present case there was no doubt that there was a common management of the share and stock business and other lines of business, unity of trading organisation, common employees, common administration, common fund and a common place of business.
