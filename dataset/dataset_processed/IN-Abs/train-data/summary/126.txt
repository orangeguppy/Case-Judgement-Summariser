section 3 of the essential supplies (temporary powers) act, 1946, which was passed by the indian legislature in 1946 empowered the central government by notified order to provide for regulating and prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of any essential commodity and trade and commerce therein; section 4 of the act empowered the central government to delegate its powers under section 3 to the provincial government or any officer thereof.
the governor of the punjab to whom such powers had been delegated under section 4 passed the east punjab cotton cloth and yarn control order, 1947, which prohibited the export of cotton cloth and yarn to any country outside india except under a permit, and made export without permit an offence.
the validity of this order was questioned on the ground that the governor had acted in excess of his powers in so far as lie prohibited export outside india without a permit: held, (i) that, keeping the object of the essential supplies act, 1946, in view and reading the words " trade and commerce " in a. 3 of the act in the light of the context, these words could be interpreted as including the export of goods outside the province including a neighbouring foreign state and the governor in passing the impugned order did not act in excess of the powers delegated to him; (ii)that as the central legislature was fully competent to legislate on exports and imports and making any provision relating thereto under the government of india act, 1935, it had power to make a law prohibiting export to a foreign state, even &part from the powers conferred on it by the india (central government and and legislature) act, 1946 (9 320 (iii) even taking the legislation to be purely on the provincial subjects of production, distribution and supply of goods, restriction of import as ancillary to production and supply of essential commodities would be quite within the scope and ambit of such legislation and in pith and substance the enactment would be one dealing exclusively with these provincial matters.
it is a cardinal rule of interpretation that the language used 'by the legislature is the true depository of the legislative intent, and that words and phrases occurring in a statute are to be taken not in an isolated or detached manner dissociated from the context, but are to be read together and construed in the light of the purpose and object of the act itself.
