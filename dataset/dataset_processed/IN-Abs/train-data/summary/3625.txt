the appellant issued the respondent a cheque which was dishonoured.
the respondent alleged that the cheque was the consideration for goods supplied.
the appellant admitted issuing the cheque but denied by privity of contract.
the respondent filed a suit under order 37 c.p.c., and the appellant applied for the required leave to defend, which was granted by the trial court unconditionally.
on revision under section 115 c.p.c., the high court held that triable issues arose for adjudication.
, but, it considered the defence to be dishonest.
if allowed the revision petition and gave conditional leave to defend on the ground that the defences were not bona fide.
allowing the appeal, the court held: it is only in cases where the defence is patently dishonest or so unreasonable that it could not reasonably be expected to succeed that the exercise of discretion by the trial court to grant leave unconditionally may be questioned.
in other cases, it is not fair to pronounce a categorical opinion on such a matter before the evidence of the parties is taken so that its effects could be examined.
high court 's interference under sec.
115 c.p.c. with the correct exercise of its discretion by the trial court was patently erroneous.
