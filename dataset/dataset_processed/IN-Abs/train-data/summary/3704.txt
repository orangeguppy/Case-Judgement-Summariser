the appellant applied on 14 10 1961 for a prospecting licence for an area of 833.53 acres under rule 9(1) of the mineral concessions rules, 1960.
the application was in order, in all respects, except to the extent that instead of rs. 32/ , the fees payable, a sum of rs. 24/ only was paid.
however, on realisation of this mistake, he paid the deficit of rs. 8/ on 28 12 1961 and, by way of abundant caution, made a fresh application on_26 2 1962.
respondent no. 1 had applied on 2 11 1961 for a prospecting licence for 748.16 acres out of which 272.40 acres were common with those for which the appellant had already applied.
since no orders were passed disposing of the applications of the appellant within 90 days of the making of it, the appellant filed a revision before the central government treating this omis sion on the part of the state to be tentamount to refusal of his application as provided by rule 11(1).
on 20 10~1964, the central government asked the state government to con sider the application of the appellant dated 14 10 1961 within the next 9 months.
the state government, instead of considering the application dated 14 10 1961 as directed, offered thrice, on 30 1 1965, 7 7 1965 and 2 4 1970, a prospecting licence for an area of 365 acres which was not accepted by him and his attempts by way of revision against these orders to the central government and a writ petition in the high court failed.
the state government, however, on 22 6 1965, directed the grant of a prospecting licence to respondent no. 1 for an area including 272.40 acres in dispute which was actually executed in his favour on 30 4 1970.
the appellant 's objection before the collector against this was rejected.
on 12 4 1973, the central government accepted the objection relating to 272.40 acres and opined that his application dated 14 10 1961 was earlier in point of lime within the meaning of section 11(2) of the mines & minerals (regulation and development) act, 1957.
against this order the respondent no. 1 went to the high court under article 226 of the constitution.
the high court quashed the orders of the central government, by its order dated 12 3 1974 and held the application of the appellant dated 14 10 1961 not having been accompanied by the correct fee was no application at all in the eye of law.
accepting the appeal by special leave, the court, held: (1) after considering legal position and all the facts and equities of the case, the central government correctly held, on the question of law before it, that the appellant 's application before the state government was a valid one as it had been entertained without objection even if it was not accompanied, when filed, by the correct amount of fee.
[706 a, e] (2) the central government had correctly relied upon an estoppel against the state government.
the deficiency in the fees having been duly accepted on behalf of the state government, it was bound to proceed on the assumption that there was a proper application before it valid from the date of filing it.
the state government was precluded by its own deeds from denying the validity of the application.
[706 a, e] 703 (3) there is no patent error upon the face of the record warranting a correction in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under article 226 of the constitution by the high court in the instant case.
on the other hand, high court itself committed an apparent error in holding that an appli cation which has only to be accompanied by the fee would be considered validly filed on the date on which it was filed only if proper fees has been tendered with it when it was filed.
[706 g h] (4) it is not very becoming for governmental authorities when duties laid down by statutory rules having been per formed by them, to take shelter behind such technicalities for denying a citizen 's right to have his application con sidered and decided.
rule 11(1) of the rules framed was a recognition of that right so that an applicant for a licence under the rules could approach the central government in case the state government did not pass the required orders within a reasonable time.
[706 e f] (5) a right and reasonable procedure looks to substance rather than form of acts or transactions in order to deter mine their nature.
there is no rule whatsoever which says that failure to submit the correct fee at the time of the filing of the application will make the application void or invalid.
rule 13 makes it clear, by differentiating between an application and the fee by which it has to be accompa nied.
the fee can be refunded but the application made remains.
the filing of the application is one thing and compliance of some annexed duty, which is legally separable, is another, unless a statute or a rule provides otherwise.
[707 a, c, 708 h 709 c] (6) it is clear from section 19 that the act itself provides what is void and ineffective where that is the intention.
section 19 attaches a voidness only to a grant made without due compliance.
with all rules.
it is nowhere said that the act of making an application will be similarly void for breach of rules.
[709 b c] (7) in the instant case, in view of the provisions of section 19 of the act, a prospecting licence in favour of respond ent no. 1 was itself void to the extent of an area of 272.40 acres for which, a licence had already been properly applied for by the appellant.
unless the applicant 's application had been properly refused for a valid reason, he could not be denied the benefit of section 11(2) of the act.
it may be that a licence cannot be granted without making good the deficiency in fee which should accompany the application, but that does nor mean that a bona fide application accompa nied by an incorrectly calculated fee or a fee which is deficient by oversight could not be made at all or if made must be treated as void or of no effect whatsoever.
[709 c g] (8) the use of the word "shall" in imposing a duty is not conclusive on the question whether the duty imposed is mandatory or directory.
it is not the breach of every mandatory duty in performing a prescribed act that could make an action totally ineffective or void ab initio.
the meaning of the. word "shall" in rule 9(2) of the mineral concessions rules, 1960, was only incidentally involved here.
