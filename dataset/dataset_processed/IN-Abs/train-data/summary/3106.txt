the petitioner was detained by an order under section 3 of the .
in a petition under article 32 of the constitution it was urged on behalf of the petitioner that a prosecution for theft under the indian penal code could have been launched on the facts alleged against him in the grounds of detention and therefore his detention was illegate.
rejecting the plea, held : it is always open to the detaining authority to pass an order for the detention of a person if the grounds of detention are germane to the object for which a detention order can legally be made.
the fact that the particular act of the detenue which provides the reason for the making of the detention order constitutes ,in offence under the indian penal code would not prevent the detaining authority from passing the, order for detention instead of proceeding against him in a court of law.
the detaining authority might well feel that though there was not sufficient evidence admissible under the indian evidence act for securing a conviction, the activities of the person ordered to be detained were of such a nature as to justify the order of detention.
even in cases where a person has been actually prosecuted in a court of law in respect of an incident and has been discharged by the trying magistrate, a valid order of his detention can be passed against him in connection with that very incident.
