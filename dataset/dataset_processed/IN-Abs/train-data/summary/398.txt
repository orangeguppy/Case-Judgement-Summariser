the appellant (a firm) consisted of seven partners and a deed of partnership was executed by all the partners except one who happened to be in jail being a security prisoner under the defence of india rules.
an application for registration of the firm under section 26 a of the indian income tax act was made before the incometax officer, who, however, rejected it on the ground that the deed of partnership and the application for registration were not signed by all the partners.
on appeal, the appellate assistant commissioner cancelled the order of the income tax officer and directed him to register the firm after obtaining the signature of the partner who had not signed before, both on the application for registration and the deed of partnership.
held, that under rule 2(c) of the indian income tax rules, 1922, framed under section 26 a(2) of the indian income tax act, the appellate assistant commissioner had only the power to direct registration of the firm if an application duly signed by all the partners had been presented to him before the assessment was confirmed, reduced, enhanced or annulled and that he was not legally 92 competent to direct the income tax officer to register the firm after obtaining the signature of the partner who had not signed before.
