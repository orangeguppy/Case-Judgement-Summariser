under a contract for the sale of goods, the buyer paid an advance amount towards the price of the goods to be supplied and various quantities of goods were thereafter delivered by the sellers.
the buyer from time to time made various other payments towards the price of the goods after they had been delivered.
the last delivery of goods was made on june 23, 1947, and the suit was brought on october 10, 1950, by the sellers for the balance of the price due for goods delivered.
the sellers pleaded that the suit was within time and relied on article 115 of the jammu and kashmir limitation act under which the period of limitation was six years for a suit " for the balance due on a mutual, open and current account, where there have been reciprocal demands between the parties.
564 held, that article 115 was not applicable to the case as there was no mutual account based on reciprocal demands.
the payment made by the buyer after deliveries had been given to it were in discharge of the obligations to pay the price due on account of these deliveries; the amount paid in advance was paid under the contract in discharge of obligations to arise ; none of such payments created an independent obligation in the sellers towards the buyer.
