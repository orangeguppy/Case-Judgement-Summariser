it was settled law that a conviction can be reasonably founded on circumstantial evidence if it is wholly inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and consistent only with his guilt.
if the circumstances proved are consistent either with innocence or guilt, the accused person is entitled to the benefit of doubt.
but in applying this principle a distinction must be made between primary facts ' which have to be proved in the ordinary way and the inference of guilt to be drawn therefrom.
it is in connection with the latter aspect of the problem that the doctrine of benefit of doubt can apply ; and an inference of guilt can be drawn only if the proved facts are wholly inconsistent with innocence, and consistent only with guilt.
