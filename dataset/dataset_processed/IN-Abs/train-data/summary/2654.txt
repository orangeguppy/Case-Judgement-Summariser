the trial court held that the assessment to tax of the sales during the period from april 1, 1949 to january 25, 1950 ' could not be impeached but the sales from january 26 to march 31 outside the state were not liable to sales tax; as there was a single order of assessment 'for the whole year, the entire assessment was illegal.

held: allowing the appeal, (i) the part of the turnover which related to sales from january 26, 1960 to march 31.
1960 was not liable to sales tax and the levy of sales tax from the appellant to this extent was illegal.
it was rightly contended that the appellant did not carry the burden of showing that there was not only delivery of goods for consumption within the states but that the goods were actually consumed in those states.
