in 1950, the appellant allotted small pre fabricated stalls to several displaced persons including the respondent, at the licence fee of rupee thirty payable per month.
later, these allottees applied for a fixation of standard rent but ultimately lost in the punjab high court at delhi, meanwhile, the respondent fell in arrears in paying the licence fee.
in december, 1960, the appellant demanded from him the entire amount in arrears from may 1950 to april 1957 but he failed to pay.
in september 1961, the estate officer ordered the respondent under section 7(1) of the act, to pay the sum, overruling his objection that the claim was barred by limitation.
the respondent 's appeal to the additional district judge was rejected, but the punjab high court at delhi allowed his writ petition on the ground that section 7 could not be availed in case of time barred claims.
the appellant contended before this court that the limitation act only barred the remedy by way of suit and did not extinguish the right which could still be exercised through section 7 of the act.
section 7 did not put a time limit for taking action under it, and was, therefore, not subject to the limitation prescribed for a suit to recover the amount.
dismissing the appeal, the court, ^ held: section 7 only provides a special procedure for the realisation of rent in arrears and does not constitute a source or foundation of a right to claim a debt otherwise time barred.
the word "payable" in section 7 in the context in which it occurs, means "legally recoverable".
