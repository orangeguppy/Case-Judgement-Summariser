the legal heirs of the joint purchaser viz the lady, were, however, not impleaded as parties.
the appellant contested this petition alleging that the respondent had no locus standi to file the petition, that the respondent was not the sole owner of the premises in occupation of the appellant, that there was no relation ship of landlord and tenant existing between the parties, that as other owners were not joined as parties the eviction petition was not maintainable, and further that the permis sion granted by the slum authority was invalid.
the addi tional rent controller held that one of the co landlords could receive payment on behalf of the other and that re ceipt of rent by one landlord would not by itself make him exclusive owner when the premises were in fact owned by more than one owner and consequently the respondent alone could not terminate the tenancy of the appellant.
