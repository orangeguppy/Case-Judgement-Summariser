da to support the transaction of pledge.
that document had rightly been found not to have been proved.
apart from the sen raleigh cycle several other cycles were found in the possession of the appellant which he claimed to have been, pledged with him.
no article of any other kind was either pointed out or claimed to have been pledged with the appellant or with members of his family which would normally have been done if the version given by him that the business of pawn brokers was being carried on had any truth in it.
