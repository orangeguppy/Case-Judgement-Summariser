a question of sentence is a matter of discretion and it is well settled that when discretion has been properly exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on the face of the judgment.
in a matter of enhancement there should not be interference when the sentence passed imposes substantial punishment.
interference is only called for when it is manifestly inadequate.
in the circumstances and bearing all the considerations of the present case in mind it was impossible to hold that the sessions judge did not impose a substantial sentence.
the supreme court set aside the sentence imposed by the court and restored that of the sessions judge as no adequate reason bad been assigned by the high court for considering the sentence passed by the sessions judge as manifestly inadequate.
