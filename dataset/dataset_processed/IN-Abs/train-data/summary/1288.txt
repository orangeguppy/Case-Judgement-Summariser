certain amounts collected by the appellants as sales tax were included in their turnover by the sales tax authorities.

vil of the government of india act, 1935 sales under which have been held to be transactions passing title to the goods from the seller to the buyer and that a mere executory agreement was not a sale within the meaning of that entry.

under sections 2(i) and 2(h) of the madras general sales tax act, 1939, the expression "turnover" means the aggregate amount for which goods are sold either for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and when a sale attracts purchase tax which is passed on to the consumer what the buyer has to pay includes the tax and the aggregate amount to be paid would fall under the definition of turnover.

although section 8b of the madras general sales tax act, 1939 and the turnover and assessment rules separately mentioned the amounts collected as tax for the purpose of paying such amounts to the government, no immutable distinction was drawn between the sale price and the tax nor was any such distinction maintained under section 2 of the impugned act.
assuming that such a distinction did exist the legislature was competent to enact under entry 54 in list ii of the constitution that the tax shall be deemed to have formed part of the turnover and obliterate the distinction for the limited period during which the impugned act operated.
the impugned act was therefore valid.
