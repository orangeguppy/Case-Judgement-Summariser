% in a petition filed by the all india services pensioners ' association, and an i.a.s. omcer who had retired from service prior to l.1.1973 (respondents in the appeal) the central administrative tribunal by its decision dated august 5, 1985, declared that rule 28(6) of the all india services (death cum retirement benefits) rules; 1958 insofar as it tended to restrict pensioners to retirement benefits to which they were entitled on the date of their retirement, and sought to deny them the benefit of the iiberalised pension and gratuity in the amended notification no. 33/12/73 ais (ii) dated january 24, 1975 was violative of article 16 of the constitution, and directed that all the members of the all india service would be entitled to liberalised pensionary benefits including gratuity as per the said notification irrespective of whether they had retired prior to january 1, 1973 or thereafter.
the appellant union of india in its appeal by special leave to this court had not questioned the tribunal 's order insofar as its liabil h 698 ity to pay pension was concerned, but sought leave against the direction to pay gratuity in accordance with the notification even to those members of the all india services who had retired prior to january 1, 1973.
on the question: whether the members of the all india services who had retired prior to january 1, 1973 are entitled to payment of gratuity as a part of retirement benefits at the rates specified in the notification no. 33;12 73 ais (ii) dated 24.
1. 1975.
allowing the appeal, ^ held:1.
in the andhra pradesh state government pensioners ' association vs state of andhra pradesh, [1986] 3 scc 501 this court had given reasons for not applying the rule in d.s. nakara vs union of india, [1983]2 scr 165 insofar as the liability of the government to pay gratuity on retirement is concerned.
[704a b] 2.
the views expressed by this court apply to all cases of gratuity where similar features exist and it should apply to the instant case too.
[704d] 3.
the way the tribunal in the instant case, has tried to ignore the decision of this court in the andhra pradesh state government pensioners ' association case is not correct.
the first ground relied on by the tribunal not to follow the said decision is that it had been rendered by this court while dismissing some special leave petitions is a wholly untenable ground.
the second ground given by the tribunal that the decision was one rendered in a case involving a notification issued by the andhra pradesh government and not one touching the notification dated january 24, 1975 is also not tenable.
[704c d] 4.
when reasons are given for dismissing special leave petitions the decision becomes one which attracts article 141 of the constitution which provides that the law declared by the supreme court shall be binding on all the courts within the territory of india.
[704b c] 5.
this court has made a distinction between the pension payable on retirement and the gratuity payable on retirement.
while pension is payable periodically as long as the pensioner is alive, gratuity is ordinarily paid only once on retirement.
[706c d] 6.
the observation made by this court in andhra pradesh state government pensioners ' association case and in m.l. abhyankar vs u.o.i, are binding insofar as the applicability of the 699 rule in d.s. nakara 's case to the liability of the government to pay gratuity on retirement.
[706d e] 7.(i) the government notification no. 33/12/73 ais (ii) dated january 24, 1975 neither expressly nor by necessary implication directs that those who had retired prior to january 1, 1973 would be entitled to any additional amount by way of gratuity.
[706e f] 7.(ii) the tribunal was in error in upholding that gratuity was payable in accordance with the government notification no. 33/12/73 ais (ii) dated january 24, 1975 to all those members of the all india services who had retired prior to january t, 1973.
it is declared that the members of the all india services who had retired prior to january 1, 1973 are not entitled to claim gratuity on the basis of the said notification.
