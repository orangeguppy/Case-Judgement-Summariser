of paddy in his godown without any licence in violation of cl. 3 of the manipur foodgrains dealers licensing order.
he was charged with having committed an offence under section 7 of the essential commodities act.
the respondent 's main defence was that the paddy was meant for the consumption of the members of his family, which was disbelieved by the trial magistrate.
the trial magistrate held that as a result of the provisions contained in cl.

3(1) is not covered by the presumption raised under cl.
575 (iii)cl.
