in response to a show cause notice dated march 15, 1957, under section 28(1)(c) of the income tax act, before imposing a penalty for deliberate concealment of its income, the appellant, through its authorised representative, voluntarily agreed to a slum of rs. 15,000/ being treated as income of hindu undivided family.
the income tax officer, by his order dated march 20,1958, added a sum of rs. 68,550/ to the income of the appellant and imposed on it a penalty of rs. 26,000/ which on appeal was reduced to rs. 15,000/ .
meanwhile, on march 19, 1957, the appellant filed an application under section 25a of the act for an order recording partition of joint family property in definite portions from june 22, 1956, claiming that date to be the date of partition.
the income tax officer, after due enquiries, accepted the disruption of the hindu undivided family as claimed by his order dated march 26, 1962.
this led the appellant to contend that, in view of ' the orders dated march 26, 1962, of the income tax officer, the imposition of the penalty by him on march 20, 1958 was bad in law and could not be sustained.
the tribunal uphold the contentions of the appellant resulting in a reference under section 66(1) of the act to the high court of allahabad (lucknow bench), which reversed the decision or the tribunal.
however, the high court granted a certificate of fitness for appeal to this court.
dismissing the appeals the court, ^ held: sub section (3) of section 25a of the income tax act embodies a legal fiction according to which a hindu family which has been previously assessed as "undivided" is to be continued to be treated as "undivided" till the passing of the order under sub section
(1) of section 25a.
so long as no order under section 25(a)(1) 1 of the act is recorded, the jurisdiction of the income tax officer to continue to assess as undivided despite a partition under personal law, a hindu family which has hitherto been assessed in that status, remain unaffected.
