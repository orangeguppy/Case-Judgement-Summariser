when a public servant is charged under section 161 of the indian penal code, and it is alleged that the illegal gratification was taken by him for doing or procuring an official act, it is not necessary for the court to consider whether or not the accused as public servant was capable of doing or intended to do such an act.
in a case where the illegal gratification is alleged to have been received by the accused as a public servant for influencing some superior officer to do an act, the charge framed against such accused under section 161 of the code need not specify the particular superior officer sought to be so influenced.
it view of article 311(1) of the constitution of india and rule 1705(c) of the indian railway establishment code, volume 1 (1951 edition) a sanction under section 6(c) of the prevention of corruption act, 1947 (as it existed prior to august 12, 1952) may be given either by the very authority who appointed the public servant or by an authority who is directly superior to such appointing authority in the same department.
but such sanction is also legal if it is given by an authority who is equal in rank or grade with the appointing authority.
sanction is invalid if it is given by one who is subordinate to or lower than the appointing authority.
