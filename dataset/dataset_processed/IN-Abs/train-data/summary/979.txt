respondent, a non resident company, in the accounting year supplied goods which were sent f. o. r. bhopal to the buyers in british india.
the railway receipts were handed over to a bank in bhopal with instructions to hand over the railway receipts to the buyers, who were named as consignees, only on receipt of payment of the bill and collection charges.
the branches of the bank within the taxable territory collected the amounts due from the buyers and transmitted them to bhopal to the credit of the respondent.
the question was whether the profits in the goods were received or deemed to be received in british india.
held, that the decision of this court in commissioner of income tax vs p. m. rathod & co. applied to this case; and the income, profits or gain must be deemed to have been received within the taxable territory.
the fact of payment to the agent determines the place where the money can be said to be received by the seller.
since in the instant case the railway receipts were not to be handed over to the buyers by the bank, as per instructions of the seller, unless payment for the value of the goods were received by the bank which instructions the buyers could not countermand, this was sufficient to make the bank an agent of the seller.
held, also, that a railway receipt is a document of title to goods, and, for all purposes, represents the goods.
when the railway receipt is handed over to the consignee on payment, the property in the goods is transferred.
the commissioner of income tax vs p. m. rathod and co., ; , relied on.
