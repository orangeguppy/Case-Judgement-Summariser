the writ petition and the slps were dismissed by this court 's order dated 5.12.1991.
taking judicial notice of the fact that the rural areas had suffered for non availability of qualified doctors, this court suggested that some preference might have to be given to in service candidates who have done five years of rural service.
held: 1.01.
the authorities might well consider giving weightage upto a maximum of 5 per cent of marks in favour of in service candidates who have done rural service for five years or more.
the actual percentage would certainly have to be left to the authorities.
[327 b] 1.02.
this might act as an incentive to doctors who had done their graduation to do rural service for some time.
[326 e] 1.03.
the observation in dr. dinesh kumar and others vs motilal nehru medical college, allahabad and others, [1986] 3 scc page 727 at 740 to the effect that no weightage should be given to the candidate for rural service rendered by him so far as admissions to post graduate courses are concerned is not the ratio of the judgment but a mere observation.
[336 h 337 a] 1.04.
the suggestions do not in any way confer any legal right on in service students who have done rural service nor do they have any application to the selection of the students upto the end of the year.
[337 b] dr dinesh kumar & ors.
vs motilal nehru medical college, allahabad & ors., ; at page 740, distinguished.
