the respondent was prosecuted for offences under section 7 of the .
the magistrate found the offences proved and he further found that the respondent had 428 committed the offence for the third time for which he was liable to be awarded a sentence of imprisonment for not less than two years and to a fine of not less than rs. 3,000.
section 21 of the act specifically empowered the magistrate to impose this sentence, but as he was under the impression that section 32 of the code of criminal procedure limited his power to impose sentences he committed the respondent to stand his trial before the court of session.
the court of session found the respondent guilty and convicted him.
on appeal the high court held that the magistrate had no power to commit and that the sessions judge had no jurisdiction to try the case, set aside the conviction and sentence and remanded the case for retrial to the magistrate held., that the commitment was not illegal and that the sessions judge had jurisdiction to try the case.
section 21 of the act was not a disabling provision and it did not make commitment by a magistrate competent to award the full sentence prescribed by the act, a nullity; it did not take away the power of the magistrate to commit.
the magistrate had both the power and the territorial jurisdiction to commit, and the commitment was good.
