section 4 of the act, before it was amended in 1956, provided that "it shall not be the function of the certifying officer or the appellate authority to adjudicate upon the fairness or reasonableness of the provisions of any standing order," while under section 3(2) the draft shall be, as far as is practicable, in conformity with the model standing orders, where they have been prescribed.
