in exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the , the central government promulgated the punjab paddy (export control) order, 1959.
paragraph 3 of the order prohibited the export of or attempt to export paddy from any place within the state of punjab to any place outside the state except under a valid permit.
paddy, booked by a firm in punjab to a consignee to delhi, was carried ' in a lorry driven by the first appellant.
the lorry was stopped by the police at a place which was 32 miles from delhi, that is, inside the state of punjab (the punjab delhi boundary was 18 miles from delhi), and the appellants, along with others, were prosecuted and convicted for an offence under section 7 of the .
in appeal to this court, held: no offence has been committed by the appellants nor was there an attempt to commit an offence.
[667 g] as the paddy was seized well inside the punjab boundary, there was no export of paddy outside the state of punjab.
it was also possible that the appellants might have changed their minds at any place between the place of seizure and the state boundary.
the acts of the appellant then would only constitute preparation and not an attempt to commit the offence of export, because, the test for determining whether acts constitute.
merely preparation and not an attempt is whether the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not proceed further, the acts already done would be completely harmless.
