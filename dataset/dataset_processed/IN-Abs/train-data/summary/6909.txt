the appellant a public limited company was manufacturing rosin, turpentine and rosin derivatives and was carrying on business at bari brahmana and jammu tawi.
on 20.1.1981, the assessing authority assessed the appellant company under the , for the year ending 30.6.80.
on 22.2.1981 an assessment order under section 10 of the act was made.
a penalty order was also made.
the appellants challenged the order of the assessing authority before the high court filing writ petition no. 87 of 1987, contending that they were exempt from payment of sales tax under the and the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act, 1962, on the finished goods produced by them for a period of five years commencing from 8th november, 1979, in terms of the government orders no. 159 ind.
dated 26.3.1971 as amended by government order no. 414 ind.
dated 25th august, 1971 read with section 8(2a) of the ; that the government represented and announced a package of incentives for large and medium scale industries grant of exemption from sales tax both on the raw materials purchased by the industries and the sale of their finished products; and that the government was estopped from charging sales tax.
the high court dismissed the writ petition holding that the two government orders were only declarations of an intention to exempt 181 from payment of sales tax and that they were not exemption notifications under section 5 of the general sales tax act and that the appellants failed to prove the factual foundation for invoking the principle of promissory estoppel.
against the high court 's decision by special leave c.a. no. 2309 of 1989 was filed by the appellant company.
c.a. no. 2310 of 1989 the appellant company had filed a miscellaneous petition, after the judgement in the w.p.no. 87 of 1987 (the writ petition of the high court against which c.a.no. 2309 of 1989 was filed) for permission to file reply affidavit on the ground of that the documents produced at the time of hearing needed explanation.
the high court dismissed the misc.
petition as it was belated and the judgement in the writ petition was delivered relying on the materials placed on record.
c.c.no.
3148 50 of 1989 the appellant partnership firm was manufacturing vanaspati ghee.
it was assessed for the period from 2.9.1981 till 30.9.1981 under the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act.
the appellants moved the high court in a writ petition (w.p.no. 52 of 1982) to quash the assessment order, contending that the government order 159 ind.
dated 26.3.1971 as amended by government order 414 ind.
dated 25.8.1971 exempted the sales of the finished product of vanaspati ghee from sales tax and that the government was estopped from collecting tax.
when the writ petition (w.p.no. 52 of 1982) was pending an assessment order was made on 14.11.1984 for the assessment year ending 30th september, 1982, including the period 2nd september to 30th september, 1981 (which was questioned in w.p.no. 52 of 1982).
the assessment order dated 14.11.1984 was challenged by the assessees appellants in the writ petition no. 822 of 1984.
during the pendency of the writ petitions certain other government orders were passed and certain assessment orders for the subse 182 quent periods were passed and those were questioned in the writ petition no. 711 of 1987.
the assessees contended that government order no. 159 ind. dated 26.3.1971 and government order 414 ind.
dated 25.8.1971 were exemption orders referable to section 5 of the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act.
the respondents contended that the said government orders were not exemption orders section 5 of the general sales tax act and that there was not factual foundation for the plea of promissory estoppel.
the high court dismissed all the three writ petitions by a common order, against which civil appeals 3148 50 of 1989 were filed.
c.a.no. 3151 of 1989 : the appellant assessee filed a writ petition praying to quash certain notices issued under section 14 of the and for a declaration that the vanaspati ghee manufactured by them was exempt from payment of tax upto january, 1992, i.e., for a period of 10 years from the date from which they started their commercial production as per the government order 159 ind.
dated 26.3.1971 and government order no. 414 ind.
dated 25th august 1971 as orders exempting their goods from sales tax under section 5 of the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act.
the writ petition was also dismissed against which c.a.no. 3151 of 1989 was filed by special leave.
the assessee contended that the exemption from payment of tax was extended from 5 years to 10 years and the government was bound to give the exemption for 10 years on the ground of promissory estoppel; that sro 448 which superseded the exemption granted under the govt.
orders was ultra vires and that the sro 448 had no effect of superseding exemption granted under the g.o. 159 and 414; and that the exemption for 5 years granted under the government orders could not be withdrawn on the ground that sro 80/82 was prospective in operation and also on the ground of promissory estoppel.
the state contended that even if the sale of a particular commod 183 ity was exempted from payment of tax under the local act, the dealer selling the same in inter state trade or commerce would be liable to pay central sales tax under the provisions of section 6(1a) of the ; that if section 6(1a) of the was applicable to a particular transaction of sale, section 8(2 a) of the general sales tax act would not be applicable to that transaction; that the conditions that the industry should have been set up and commissioned subsequent to the government orders 159 and 414 and the commodity sold in order to claim the exemption under the government orders, should be those manufactured by that industry were the conditions or specified circumstances within the meaning of the explanation and, therefore, the appellants in c.a.nos.
2309, 2310/89 were not entitled to any exemption under section 8(2 a) of the ; that the government orders were superseded by sro 80/82 and vanaspati ghee was made liable to tax at the rate of 8 per cent; that the goods manufactured by the appellants in c.a.nos.
2309, 2310/89 were also made taxable as falling under the residuary item at the rate of 8 per cent; that in the assessment order relating to assessment year 1981 82 for the period from 1.9.1981 to 30.8.1982 in the case of appellants in c.a. nos.
3148 3150 of 1989 there was a finding that the assesses collected sales tax in respect of their sales turnover for which the exemption was now claimed and that under section 8 b of the j&k general sales tax act the said amount was refundable to the government.
as the questions, arose in these appeals were common, appeals were heard together and allowing the appeals of the assessees by a common judgment, this court, held :1.
if power to do an act or act or pass an order can be traced to an enabling statutory provision, then often if that provisions is not specifically referred to, the act or order shall be deemed to have been done or made under the enabling provision.
[194d] 2.1 normally in the case of grant of tax exemption as an incentive to industry the exemption orders have generally taken the form of government order rather than a notification.
but in the case of other exemptions though they are also under section 5 of the local act (j&k general sales tax act, 1962) they have taken the form of notification.
[194g h] 2.2 the pattern followed in jammu & kashmir is that in respect 184 of exemptions from payment of taxes following cabinet decision on policy matters and incentive they have taken the form of a government order.
[194h 195a] 2.3 the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act, 1962 itself makes a distinction requiring a notification to be made for certain purposes and the making of a government order in respect of certain other purposes.
since there is no form prescribed in this behalf, if the particular order in effect is an exemption order, whether it takes the form of an order or notification makes no difference.
[194f g] 2.4 from the publicity given to the government orders 159 and 414 by the government, while inviting entrepreneurs to establish industries in jammu & kashmir and certain other communications to the parties, it is be understood that the government orders 159 and 414 were treated as exemption orders satisfy all the requirements of the provisions of section 5 of the local act.
[195b c, 194e] 2.5 even as an order of exemption the appellant will have to show that he had set up the industry in conformity with the intent of 1971 order and entitled in terms thereof to the exemption in respect of the goods manufactured by him.
but that is not to say that after he establishes those facts the government will have to make a separate order of exemption in relation to him.
[201c d] 2.6 there is no prescribed form for granting exemption under section 5 of the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act.
there is also no prohibition against reference to any other matter or matters in exemption orders under section 5 of the general sales tax act.
if the incentives related also to other benefits or rights merely because they are included in the same government order does not make it any the less an exemption order so far as the exemption related to payment of sales tax.
[202c d] 2.7 the high court was in error in thinking that the exemption order should be specific in favour of the appellant.
the exemption as can be seen from the provisions of section 5 of the jammu & kashmir general sales tax act could be in respect of any class of dealers or any goods or class or description of goods.
there could be an exemption to an individual also but the power of exemption is not restricted to such cases alone.
it may refer to transactions of sale of a particular type of goods or class or description of goods or in respect of any class of 185 dealers or a combination of both.
[201b] 3.1 `will be granted exemption ' has the same meaning as `will be exempted ' and does not in any way show that it requires a further follow up action.
[201g h] 3.2 the exemption is with reference to an industry which is to be established subsequent to the government order.
therefore in that sense both expressions mean the same.
[202a] 4.
the notification issued on the 3rd of june 1971 in sro 214 under section 23 of the jammu & kashmir urban immovable property tax act, 1962, amending the immovable property tax rules, 1962 by inserting rules 20 a was subsequent to go 159 ind. dated 26.3.1971.
it was published on 25.3.1971 in the government gazette under section 23(1) for information of all persons likely to be affected thereby and any objection or suggestion which may be received in the finance department from any person with respect to the said draft before the said date will be considered by the government.
it is by reason of the fact that this draft rule has been published calling for objection the go 159 ind. itself stated that the grant of immovable property tax exemption would be available "as admissible under the urban immovable property taxation rules".
thus on the day when the government order was made there was already the draft amendment rules, and, therefore, it could not be stated that the amendment was a follow up action in pursuance of the government order.
the government order refers to the draft and says as per the amendment they will be entitled to the exemption.
[202e 203b] 5.1 the only reference to 10 years was in the finance minister 's speech and in the brochure dated september 1978.
the brochure only lists the concession and incentives available generally.
it does not refer to any government decision or cabinet decision or any order of the government.
[203g h] 5.2 the finance minister 's statement made in march 1978 only refers to a proposal to continue the grant of exemption from payment of sales tax for a period of 10 years.
this statement also is not unambiguous.
it may mean that the benefits under the government orders 159 and 414 may be continued for another 10 years without withdrawing the same.
this is merely a budget proposal which could 186 give rise to no right to the appellants.
as no decision order or notifications is produced extending the period of exemption in relation to sales tax it is not possible to consider the claim of the appellants for exemption for 10 years on the ground of promissory estoppel.
[204 b c] 6.1 the sro no. 195 dated 31.3.1978 did not and could not supersede the exemption granted under the government orders 159, 414.
[205d] 6.2 when it stated in the amending notification sro 448 dated 22nd october, 1982 that vanaspati and edible oils are taxable at the point specified therein it only means that those vanaspati and edible oils which are not exempted are taxable at the points specified in the schedule.
the government order gave exemption only for five years from the date of commencement of the industry and those industries who had been manufacturing for more than that period and also those industries who were not entitled to the benefit of the said government order would be liable to pay sales tax on the vanaspati manufactured by them and the said goods were liable to tax at the point specified in the schedule.
[205f g] 7.1 in the scheme of levy of single point taxation, the government could fix any point in the series of sales for the government have fixed the sale by the dealer, that if the second sale, as the taxable point no exception can be taken.
in that sense no question of vires on the ground of lack of power would arise.
[205h 206a] 7.2 under section 4(1) of jammu & kashmir general sales tax act the goods are taxable only once, that is it could be taxed only at one point of sale.
the government orders 159 and 414 are exemption orders and exempt the sale by appellants of their manufactured products.
the exemption would not arise unless the goods are taxable at the point of their sale.
thus the effect of exempting their sale is that the said goods manufactured by them could not be taxed at the second or subsequent sales also as that would offend section 4(1) which provides for single point levy.
in cases where there are no exemption orders and the state fixed the second or subsequnt sale as point of taxation the first or prior or subsequent sales are not exempted sales but are not taxable sales.
therefore sro 448 fixing he sale of vanaspati ghee by a dealer would not be applicable to vanaspati ghee manufactured by the appellants which are exempt under the government orders.
[206b d] 187 7.3 the goods manufactured by the appellants are exempt under government orders 159 and 414 and that exemption covers entire series of sales of that very goods.
[206d] 8.1 under section 6(1) of the every dealer who sells goods in the course or inter state trade or commerce shall be liable to pay tax under that act.
a sale of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter state trade or commerce if the sale occasions the movement of goods from one state to another or if effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one state to another.
[207d e] 8.2 in view of the provisions of section 15 the state law can impose tax on sale of declared goods only at a rate not exceeding four per cent of the sale price and such tax also shall not be levied at more than one stage.
if the tax has been levied under the state law on declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter state trade and tax has been paid under the central sales tax the law levied under the state law shall be reimbursed to the person making such sale in the course of inter state trade.
[208c e] 8.3 section 8(2 a) of the does not have any over riding effect on the scheme of taxation relating to inter state sale of declared goods.
there is also scope for the applicability of section 6(1 a) of the when the inter state sale takes place when the goods are in transit and is effected by transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one state to another.
[209b c] 8.4 only certain cases which would have been covered by section 6(1 a) of the have been carved out for the purpose of exemption subject to the applicability of section 8(2 a) of the .
section 6(1 a) of the has not become otiose by reason of inclusion of that section in the non obstante clause in section 8(2 a).
both provisions, therefore, operate and they should not be read so as to nullify the effect of one another.
[209c e] 9.
the facts which the dealer had to prove to get the benefit of the government orders are intended only to identify the dealer and the goods in respect of which the exemption is sought and they are not conditions or specifications of circumstances relating to the turnover sought 188 to be exempted from payment of tax within the meaning of those provisions.
the specified circumstances and the specified conditions referred to in the explanation should relate to the transaction of sale of the commodity and not identification of the dealer or the commodity in respect of which the exemption is claimed.
the conditions relating to identity of the goods and the dealer are always there in every exemption and that cannot be put as a condition of sale.
[210d f] 10.1.
sro 80/82 was prospective in operation.
the government seems to have been following as a pattern that is in the case of incentives to industries the exemption orders had taken the form of a government order.
government orders 159 and 414 were also in pursuance of a cabinet decision.
sro 80/82 though a government notification under the business rules it is issued by the ministry concerned.
in the circumstances there is also a serious doubt whether the said incentives could have been superseded by the sro 80/82.
[213h 214b] 10.2.
in the case of a grant of exemption without specifying any period for which the exemption is available the government could withdraw the same at any time.
the appellants acting on the representations of the government had set up their industries.
therefore they are entitled to claim the benefit of the exemption for the entire period of five years calculated as per the terms of the government orders, even if it were to be held that sro 80/82 superseded the earlier exemption orders.
[216d e, 216g 217a] 11.
since the assessment orders were regular assessment orders on the ground that their sales are taxable sales the question of applicability of section 8b of the local act does not arise.
that question arises in view of the finding that their sales turnover are exempt but still under section 8b of the local act, they are liable to refund any money collected "by way of tax".
