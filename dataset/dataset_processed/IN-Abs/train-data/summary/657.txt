section 4 of the ajmer abolition of intermediaries and land reforms act, 955, provided for vesting of all estates held by intermediaries, as defined in the act, in the state from a date to be notified, and the petitioners who were affected thereby filed petitions under article 32 of the constitution of india challenging the validity of the act and, in particular sections 8 and 38 of the act on the grounds that (1) entry 36 of list 11 of the 479 seventh schedule to the constitution gave power to the state legislature to acquire property for purposes other than the purposes of the union, while the property acquired under the act vested in the president and therefore the union after its acquisition, and the act was really for the acquisition of property for the purposes of the union and could not have been passed by the, ajmer legislature, (2) section 8 provided for retrospective cancellation of leases granted at a time when the land owner had a right to dispose of his property as he liked under article 19(1)(f) of the constitution and there was no restriction on such right, and (3) section 38 which fixed a maximum rent was an unreasonable.restriction on the right of the land owner to let his holding.
it was also contended for some of the petitioners who were assignees of land revenue as also owners of land that, under the act, an intermediary included a jagir and that as a jagirdar was merely an assignee of land revenue, only that assignment could be said to have been acquired under the act.
held, (1) that the purposes for which the estates were acquired were purposes of the state of ajmer and, consequently, the act was within the competency of the ajmer legislature as it fell within entry 36 of list ii of the seventh schedule to the constitution, and it was not necessary to consider where the property should vest after acquisition in deciding the ambit of the competence of the legislature under the entry ; (2) that the provisions in section 8 of the act which gave power to the collector to cancel leases which were found to have been made in anticipation of legislation for abolition of intermediaries and which were, consequently, a fraud upon the act, subserve the purposes of the act and would, therefore, be an integral part of the act, though ancillary to its main object, and were protected under article 31 a(1)(a) of the constitution ; (3)that the intention of the act was that the intermediaries who were allotted lands should cultivate them personally and the object of section 38 was to discourage them from letting the land and becoming a new kind of intermediaries, and, consequently, the section being an ancillary provision necessary for the purposes of carrying out the objects of the act, was protected under article 31 a(1)(a) of the constitution; and (4)that in view of the origin of the title of the holders of these estates who were called jagirdars, a distinction could not be made between jagirdars as assignees of land revenue and the same persons as land owners, and therefore, the state could take over the entire interest in the estate under section 4 of the act.
