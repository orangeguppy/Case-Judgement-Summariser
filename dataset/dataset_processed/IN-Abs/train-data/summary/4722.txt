the respondents were convicted and sentenced for committing murder and other offences.
the deceased and the respondents, who respectively belonged to the rajput and the harijan factions of the village, had a dispute over a piece of land which had been decided in favour of the rajputs by a final order of the high court in second appeal.
when the respondents ' appeal against conviction in the criminal case came up for hearing, the high court took the view that 'the matter could be settled by a compromise ' and invited the harijans and rajput panchayats of the village to appear before it and, ultimately, called for the papers of the second appeal decided earlier and passed an order to the effect that, as agreed between the parties, the claim of the harijans for four kanals of land was allowed.
finding that some of the affected parties were not served, the high court directed that if any unserved party had a grievance, it could apply for review of the judgment.
after re disposing of the second appeal relating to the dispute over land in the manner stated above, the high court took up the criminal appeal for hearing and, without considering the evidence before it, delivered a short judgment acquitting the respondents.
remanding the appeal, ^ held: it is impossible to appreciate how the high court could dispose of the criminal appeal in this extraordinary fashion.
it is obvious that the high court had made up its mind to acquit the accused without considering the evidence before it.
finding that the offence of murder cannot be compounded, the high court took the facile course of acquitting the accused who, by a considered judgment, were convicted by the trial court.
[814 c d] the judgment of the high court shows how important it is for the judges to observe the norms laid down by law for dispensing justice. 'justice under the tree ' or 'panchayat justice ' have advantages of their own, but they cannot be confused with justice according to the chancellor 's foot.
