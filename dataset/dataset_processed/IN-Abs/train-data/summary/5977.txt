in the lok sabha elections held in 1984, the appellant was declared elected from the nizamabad parliamentary constitu ency.
he .secured 2,51,172 votes, while respondent no. 1 got 2,48,725 votes.
an election petition under sections 80 and 81 of the act was filed in the high court, by the first respondent; challenging the election of the appellant on grounds of illegalities and irregularities in the counting of votes, impersonation of voters and corrupt practices.
the high court set aside the election only on one ground that is, the additional returning officers in respect of the nizamabad parliament constituency were not appointed and authorised by the election commission to perform the duties and functions of returning officers and every action taken by such officers, including the rejection of doubtful ballot papers, is absolutely illegal, void and forbidden by law.
the high court gave directions to the election commission for recounting.
this appeal, by special leave, is against the high court 's order setting aside the election.
on behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the officers were duly appointed and authorised by the election commission.
the first respondent contended that the officers were not duly appointed by the election commission and that their purported exercise of power as additional assistant returning officers was without authority and in contraven tion of the relevant legal provisions.
