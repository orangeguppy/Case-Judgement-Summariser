the appellant, a registered housing co operative socie ty, acquired about 70 acres of land during the period 1973 to 1975.
after the enactment of u.p. industrial area development act, 1976, the state government constituted an industrial development authority called noida.
soon after the constitu tion of the said authority, notifications were issued under the land acquisition act acquiring certain lands including that of the appellant society.
the appellant and several other societies demanded land in lieu of the land acquired.
a sub committee was constitut ed and it was proposed to offer developed plots to the bona fide members of the societies whose lands were acquired.
an approximate rate of rs. 130 per square metre was fixed.
it was also stipulated that 30% of the price would have to be deposited before a tripartite agreement between noida, co operative societies and individual members is made after finalisation of lay out plan.
the appellant society filed a writ petition in the high court alleging that the action taken by noida was arbitrary and challenging the notifications issued under sections 4 and 6 of the land acquisition act.
meanwhile, the authority had intimated the appellant society that it was finally decided to offer lands, and that 20% of the amount had to be deposited within a stipulated time.
the society requested for extension of time.
time was not extended and the society was not allotted the land.
it was contended before the high court that the authori ty acted mala fide, and its not extending the time was arbitrary and discrimi 65 natory.
the land price fixed by the authority was also challenged.
the high court dismissed the writ petition, holding that the appellants society had no legal right to get a particular land and that it did not avail the conces sion granted by the authority.
this appeal by special leave is against the order of the high court.
disposing of the appeal, this court.
