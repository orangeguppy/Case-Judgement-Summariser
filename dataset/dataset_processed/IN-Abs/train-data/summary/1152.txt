the question was whether (a) the income tax officer had power on october 31, 1951, to impose a penalty under section 40(1) of the hyderabad income tax act and (b) whether the assessee had a right to appeal against the order of the income tax officer imposing penalty and whether the appellate assistant commissioner had jurisdiction to hear appeals or whether his order was a nullity.
