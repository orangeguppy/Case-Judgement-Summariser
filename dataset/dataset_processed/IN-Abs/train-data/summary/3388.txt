when a notification is published under section 12(1) of the , under section 12(2) the right, title and interest of the evacuee in the evacuee property is extinguished and the property vests absolutely in the central government free from all encumbrances.
section 13 of the act provides for the payment of compensation for such acquisition in accordance with the principles agreed upon between the government of india and pakistan.
no such principles of compensation had, however, been agreed upon between the two governments.
the appellant was declared an evacuee and his property as evacuee property.
when the notification under section 12 was issued, he challenged it but the high court dismissed his writ petition holding that the vesting in the central government was unconditional and did not depend upon the fixation or payment of compensation under section 13.
dismissing the appeal to this court, ^ held: (1) in the face of the clear provision in section 12(2), it could not be contended that the evacuee property did not vest in the central government until compensation for its acquisition had been determined and paid.
[781f] (2) the appellant could not rely on article 31(2) because, article 31(5) expressly provides that it shall not affect the provisions of any law which the state may make either in pursuance of an agreement with the government of any other country "or otherwise".
so even in the absence of an agreement with the government of pakistan, it is permissible for the state to make the act, and its provisions would not be affected by anything contained in article 31(2).
[781cd] (3) under section 13, compensation would have been payable to the appellant in accordance with any principles agreed upon between the government of india and pakistan.
therefore, in the absence of such an agreement, the appellant would not be entitled to claim any compensation.
