the respondent no. i was a journalist supplying news to the petitioner 's newspaper on payment of a fixed monthly honorarium.
contrary to the petitioner 's instructions the respondent no. i left india and thereupon the petitioner terminated the arrangement.
upon his return to india the respondent no. i requested the petitioner to reconsider its decision but the petitioner declined to do so.
the respondent no. i applied to the state government under section 17 of tile working journalists (conditions of service) and miscellaneous provisions act, 1955 claiming a large sum of money from the petitioner.
the state government nominated respondent no. 2 as the authority under section 17 of the act and referred the claim to him.
the petitioner disputed the whole claim and contended that the respondent no. 2 had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the merits of the disputed claim: held, that the authority specified under section 17 of the act had no jurisdiction to determine the amount due as the section merely provided for a procedure to recover an amount from the employer which had previously been determined by a competent authority or court.
if the legislature had intended that the enquiry under section 17 should include the examination of the merits of the claim and a decision thereon, it would have made appropriate provisions conferring upon the state government or the specified authority the relevant powers essential for the purpose of effectively holding such an enquiry; but no such powers had been conferred.
