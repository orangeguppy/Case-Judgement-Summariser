the appellant, an employee of the northern railway was removed from service.
his appeal against the order of removal was rejected by the general manager.
the appellant feeling aggrieved filed a writ petition under article 226.
in the writ petition, the general manager was joined as a respondent but the union of india was not impleaded.
on appeal, the division bench confirmed the decision of the single judge.
the counsel for the appellant contended that the general manager is the authority to hear the matters regarding the removal and, therefore, he is the proper authority.
dismissing the appeal by special leave, held: the appellant was servant of the union.
the order of removal is removal from the service of the union.
any order of a court would have to be enforced against the union.
the general manager or any other authority acting in the railway administration is as much a servant of the union as the appellant was in the present case.
the union of india represents the railway administration.
the union carries administration through different servants.
any order setting aside the removal would fasten liability on the union of india and not on any servant of the union.
there fore, the union of india is a necessary party.
