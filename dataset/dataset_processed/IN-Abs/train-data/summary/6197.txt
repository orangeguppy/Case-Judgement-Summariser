these two appeals arise out of the judgments in two election petitions before the andhra pradesh high court questioning the election of respondent no. 1 as a member of parliament from srikakulam no. 1 parliamentary constituency in the 8th general election to the house of the people on the ground that shri n .t.
rama rao the chief minister of andhra pradesh as well as respondent no. 1 gave certain speeches and certain advertisements were got published by shri n.t. rama rao through the publicity department of the govt.
of andhra pradesh in the newspapers containing certain statements which are alleged to amount to a corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123(1)(a) of the representa tion of the people act 1951.
dismissing the appeals, this court, held: that these advertisements and speeches amount to nothing more than statements extorting the achievements of the government of the state of andhra pradesh under the telegu desham party headed by n.t. rama rao, chief minister and contain normal election promises and these advertise ments donot amount to corrupt practices falling within the scope of sub clause (b) of clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 123 of the said act.
