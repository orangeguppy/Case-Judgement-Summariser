the first respondent and five other members of madhya pradesh state civil service challenged before the central administrative tribunal the selection of 14 officers of the state civil service for promotion to the indian administra tive service as illegal on the ground that the state had wrongly calculated the anticipated number of vacancies as 7 by counting the period of 12 months under regulation 5(1) of the indian administrative service (appointment by promotion) regulations, 1955, from december 1, 1988 to november 30, 1989, instead of from march 16, 1989 to march 15, 1990, and if the latter period was considered as the proper period for the purposes of the said regulation, the vacancies would he 11 and the select list of 22 officers would have to he prepared, for which 66 officers would have to be considered, and the zone of consideration would extend to the 84th officer in the seniority list, since 18 of the 66 officers were ineligible under regulation 5(3).
on behalf of the state government it was contended that since the meeting was first held on december 19, 1988 the period of 12 months under the regulation 5(1) would have to he calculated from december 1, 1988 to november 30, 1989 according to the previous practice of the government, which was that since the committee met in the second fortnight of december, the period was to be calculated from the 1st december, 1988.
the tribunal held that neither the practice adopted by the state government, nor the interpretation placed by it on regulation s(1) was proper, and that the span of 12 months would begin from march 16, 777 1989 and end on march 15, 1990 and directed that a select list of 22 officers should be prepared since during the later period, the estimated vacancies were 11, and that a review committee should be constituted to consider the cases of the applicants.
dismissing the appeal preferred by the union of india, this court, held: 1.1 the wording of the regulation 5(1) of the indian administrative service (appointment by promotion) regulations, 1955, is very clear.
it says "commencing from the date of preparation of the list".
[779f] 1.2 in the present case, admittedly the list which was prepared by the selection committee on december 19, 1988 was not according to regulation 5(1) read with regulation 5(2).
since the selection committee had, on the basis of its estimate of seven vacancies on december 19, 1988 considered the cases of only 30 officers when it was required to con sider the cases of 42 officers, the union public service commission had returned its recommendation and asked the selection committee to consider the cases of 12 more offi cers.
hence, the preparation of the select list was not complete in december, 1988 and the committee was required to convene a fresh meeting on march 16, 1989, on which date alone it can be said to have prepared the select list as required by regulation 5(1).
since the select list, as required by regulation 5(1) was for the first time prepared on march 16, 1989, the period of 12 month under regulation 5(1) had to be counted from that date.
[779g h, 780a b] 1.3 during the period of 12 months from 16th march, 1989 tc 15th march, 1990, the estimated vacancies were 11 and, therefore, select list of 22 officers has to be prepared by considering the cases in all of 66 officers and extending the zone to the 84th officer in the seniority list according to the order of seniority (18 officers out of 66 being ineligible).
[780c d] 2.
the provision of regulation 5(3) speaks of the first day of january of the year "in which", the selection commit tee "meets" unlike the language of regulation 5(1) which speaks of "the date of the preparation of the list".
in the present case, the committee first met of december 19, 1988.
therefore, for the purpose of regulation 5(3), it is that date which is relevant and if that is so, it is only those members of the state civil service who had attained the age of 54 years on january 1, 1988 who would be ineligible.
[781c d] 778 3.
in the circumstances, for the purposes of the review selection committee to be convened, the zone of considera tion will be as if the meeting was held on march 16, 1989.
the actual number of vacancies which will have to be consid ered is 11.
