"b" the appellant/head constable with a view to help the accused not only to get an acquittal but get back the seized coins approached "j" a constable who was in charge of an investigation of a case under section 411 i.p.c. to substitute the j seized gold coins with different markings offering a bribe of rs. 1,000/ .
j reported the matter to the d.s.p. concerned and as per the directions, the raiding party arrested 'b ' and the other accused in a hotel and also recovered from him the gold coins of different markings.
the currency notes of rs. 1,000/ in the hands of 'j ' offered by 'b ' were also recovered.
the special judge convicted 'b ' and sentenced him to undergo r.i. for one year which was maintained by the high court.
on appeal by special leave, the appellant contended that since the prosecution case rested principally on the testimony of 'j ', the whole edifice is destroyed on that witness being declared 'hostile '.
rejecting the contention and dismissing the appeal, the court ^ held: the prosecution could have even avoided requesting for permission to cross examine the witness u/s 154 evidence act.
but the fact that the court gave permission to the prosecutor to cross examine him as what is described as "hostile witness", does not completely efface his evidence.
the evidence remains admissible in the trial and there is no legal bar to have a conviction upon his testimony if corroborated by other reliable evidence.
