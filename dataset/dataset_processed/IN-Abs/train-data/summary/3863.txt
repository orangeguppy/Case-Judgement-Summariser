[387 b] (2) in order to find the person guilty of offence under section 300 read with section 149, the prosecution must establish that the offence was committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of the assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew it to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object.
it is, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to establish that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to commit an offence under section 300 or that the members of the assembly knew it to be likely that an offence under section 300 punishable under section 302 ipc would be committed in prosecution of the common object.
[387 b d] (3) if the injuries that are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death are traced to a particular accused, he will be guilty of an offence under section 300 punishable under section 302 without the aid of section 149, when the injuries caused are cumulatively sufficient to cause death, it is necessary before holding 384 each of the accused guilty under section 300 read with section 149 to find that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to cause death or that the members of the unlawful assembly knew it to be likely that an offence punishable under section 302 ipc would be committed in prosecution of the common object.
