the respondent who was the karta of his hindu undivided family entered into partnership with one d to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling pharmaceutical products etc.
on july 27, 1946 the partnership was dissolved.
the assets of the firm which included goodwill, machinery, furniture etc. were valued on the date of dissolution at rs. 2,50,000 and the respondent was paid the sum of rs. 1,25,000 in lieu of his share and the business together with the goodwill was taken over by d.
the question in income tax proceedings was whether the transaction was one of sale liable to capital gains tax under section 12b(1) of the income tax act.
the assessing and appellate authorities held against the respondent.
the high court in reference, however, held in his favour.
the revenue appealed.
held : there was no clause in the partnership agreement providing for the method of dissolution of the firm or for winding up of its affairs.
in the course of dissolution the assets of the firm may be valued and the assets divided between the partners according to their respective shares by allotting the individual assets or paying money value equivalent thereof.
this is a recognised method of making up the accounts of the dissolved firm.
in that case the receipt of money by a partner is nothing but a receipt of his share in the distributed assets of the firm.
the respondent received the money value of his share in the assets of the firm; he did not agree to sell, exchange on transfer his share in the assets of the firm.
payment of the amount agreed to be paid to the respondent under the arrangement of his share was therefore not consequence of any sale, exchange or transfer of assets.
