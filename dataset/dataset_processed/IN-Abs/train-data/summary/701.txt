the appellant carried on business in england and in india.
for the previous years it paid excess profits tax in both countries and it obtained deduction of the amounts so paid from its profits and gains for the purposes of the indian income tax act.
in the assessment year 1947 48 it obtained a repayment of rs.
2,31,009 out of the excess profits tax paid in england.
the income tax authorities acting under section 11(14), indian finance act 1946, included this amount received in england in the taxable profits of the appellant.
the appellant contended that the repayment not being within the taxable territory it could not be taxed.
held, that the amount received as repayment of the excess profits tax was rightly taxed.
under section 11(14) the amount of repayment was deemed to be 'income ' for purposes of the indian income tax act and that ' income ' was to be treated as the income for the previous year during which the repayment was made.
section 11(14) created a liability irrespective of the considerations arising from the general provisions of the income tax law.
the distinction between incomes within and without taxable territories was made unnecessary by section 11(14).
