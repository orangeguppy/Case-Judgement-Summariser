the respondent, a constable, convicted under sections 325/34 of the indian penal code along with another co ac cused constable and dismissed from service, filed a suit challenging his dismissal, which was dismissed by the trial court holding that it was barred by limitation.
on appeal the first appellate court decreed his suit by holding that the respondent plaintiff was discriminated because his co accused was re instated in service pursuant to the decision in the suit filed by the co accused; his dismissal was void on the ground of arbitrariness, and the bar of limitation was not applicable.
the defendant appellant filed a regular second appeal against the aforesaid decree before the high court which was dismissed in limine.
in the appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the high court erred in dismissing the second appeal in limine.
allowing the appeal, this court, held: 1.
serious questions of law are involved in this case and they should not have been lightly brushed aside by the high court in the manner it has been done.
therefore the high court erred in dismissing the second appeal in limine.

rule 16.2 (2) of the punjab police rules, 1934 manda torily directs that a police officer judicially sentenced to rigorous imprisonment exceeding one month shall be dis missed, and this mandate of law 823 cannot be ignored on the ground that in the case of another member of the police force a mistake was committed.
