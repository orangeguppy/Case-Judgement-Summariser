(2) neither the trial court nor the sessions court committed any error of fact or of law in arriving at their conclusions and the high court misdirected itself in upsetting their concurrent findings ignoring the well recognised principles for the exercise of revisional jurisdiction.
from the material on record it is clear that the offences with which the respondents were charged were brought home to them beyond reasonable doubt.
