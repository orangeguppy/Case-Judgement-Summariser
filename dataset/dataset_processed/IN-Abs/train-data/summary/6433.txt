the appellant is a municipal board governed by the provisions of the u.p. municipalities act, 1916.
section 128 of the act provides for imposition of taxes by the board.
in exercise of the powers under sections 131 to 135 and 296 of the act, the government of the united provinces framed octroi rules.
the said rules were included in the municipal account code (chapter x rules 131 to 231).
the proviso to rule 131 provided that octroi shall not be levied on certain articles which included mineral oil.
the rule was amended vide notification dated the 2nd november 1953 and for the words "the mineral oil" in the proviso, the words "mineral oils classified as motor spirit, kerosene or diesel oil" were substituted.
separate rules for the assessment and collection of octroi in the bareily municipality were framed by the govt.
of u.p.
the draft rules were notified vide notification dated the 16th february 1963.
final rules were notified vide notification dated the 7th may 1963 and published in u.p. gazette dated the 11th may 1963.
by a notification dated the 24th july 1963, published in u.p. gazette dated the 3rd august, 1963, the appellant board imposed octroi duty on goods and animals brought within the octroi limits of barei ly municipality for consumption, use and sale at the rates shown in the schedule subject to certain exceptions men tioned therein.
the said notification came into operation from november 16, 1963 and thereafter the levy of octroi in bareily municipality was governed by 1963 rules.
the amend ments were made in the octroi schedule both in the rates as well as in the exemption and as a result whereof motor spirit, kerosene and diesel oil were removed from the exemp tion clause and were subjected to the octroi duty @ 1 paisa per liter vide notification dated august 27, 1969.
the respondents challenged the validity of the notification dated 377 the 27th august 1969 by means of a writ petition before the high court on the ground that 1925 rules took away the power from all municipal boards to impose octroi duty on mineral oils and until such power is restored under a contrary notification issued under section 128 of the act, the board did not have any justification to assess or collect octroi duty on mineral ohs.
the appellant board contended that rule 131 was superseded by the 1963 rules which now governed the imposition of octroi by the appellant board.
the single judge of the high court who heard the petition came to the conclusion that rule 131 restricted the power of the board to impose the octroi and the subject matter of the rule was not covered by the 1963 rules.
the appellant 's appeals preferred before the division bench were dismissed which took the view that the bar under rule 131 regarding the imposition of octroi duty on mineral oils continued notwith standing the 1963 rules.
hence these appeals by the munici pal board.
allowing the appeals, this court, held: the rule making power under section 296 read with section 300(2) of the act enables the state government to except any one municipality from the operation of the gener al rule by express provision in that behalf.
when the iden tical authority in exercise of its rule making power duly frames the rules in respect of the same matter expressly providing that the new rules shah apply to a particular municipality in supersession of the existing rules, it must be deemed that existing rules are repealed to that extent.
[384c d] the 1963 rules had been framed under section 296 of the act in supersession of the existing rules after the publica tion by the state government, in the gazette as provided under section 300 and therefore rule 131 in the 1925 rules ceased to have any operation in respect of the matters dealt with therein so far as the bareilly municipality is con cerned.
