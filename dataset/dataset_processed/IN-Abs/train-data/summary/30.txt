(j) of sub section
(2) of section (3) of the above said act, which had been delegated to the provincial govern ment in relation to food stuffs, the governor of bihar made an order authorising the district magistrate, patna, and the special officer in charge of rationing, patna, to search the stock of sugar held by a company of which the appellant was the general manager and directing the seizure of 5,000 maunds of sugar held in stock by the said company, on the ground that the company was about to commit a contravention of an order of the chief controller of prices and supplies made under the sugar and sugar products control 304 order, 1947.

quaere: whether for an offence under section 186, penal code, it is necessary that the act which was obstructed must be duly authorised and otherwise lawful.
