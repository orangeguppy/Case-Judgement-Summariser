the respondent applied for registration of the trade name "lakshmandhara" in relation to the medicinal preparation manufactured by him at kanpur since 1923.
it was admitted that the respondent 's product was mainly sold in the state of uttar pradesh.
the appellant opposed the registration on the ground that it had an exclusive proprietary interest in the trade mark "amritdhara" in relation to a similar medicinal preparation which had acquired considerable repu tation since 1903 and that the respondent 's trade name "lakshmandhara" was likely to deceive and cause confusion and therefore the registration was prohibited by section 8 of the trade marks act.
the registrar of trade marks held that there was sufficient similarity between "amritdhar 'a ' and "lakshamandhara" so as to cause confusion and it was likely to deceive the public, but the acquiescence of the appellant in the use of the trade name "lakshmandhara" by the respondent in the relation to his product for a long period to the knowledge of the appellant was special circumstance under section 10(2) entitling the respondent to have his name registered along with the appellant 's trade name.
he, however, confined the registration to sales with the state of uttar pradesh.
