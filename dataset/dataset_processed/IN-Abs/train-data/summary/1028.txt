the appellant company also moved the executing court for a declaration that they were entitled and bound to deduct the tax due on the amount.
the district judge directed the appellant company to pay the income tax and super tax to the income tax department and pay the balance in court together with a receipt for the income tax paid.
in appeal the high court reversed the order of the district judge and directed the execution of the decree as claimed by the respondent.
on appeal by the appellant company, held, that as no tax was assessed against the respondent the income tax officer could not issue a notice under section 46(5) requiring the appellant company to deduct tax from the decretal amount.
