delhi police (appointment and recruitment) rules, 1980, whether supersedes the earlier punjab police rules, 1934, though it is deemed to be in force by virtue of section 149(2) of the delhi police act, 1978 construction of a new law. , sections 147 and 149 scope and effect of, explained rules 30 and 32 of the 1980 police rules.
the (act 34/78) which came into force with effect from 1.7. 1978 by virtue of section 149 thereof repealed the earlier act of 1861.
however, the first proviso to section 149(1) provided that all rules and stand ing orders (including the punjab police rules, as in force in delhi) made under the would be in so far as they were consistent with the act may be deemed to have been respectively made under the act.
consequently the said 1934 rules continued to be in force even after the commence ment of the act.
by virtue of the authority vested under section 147(2)(a) of the 1978 act, the lt. governor of delhi promulgated the delhi police (appointment and recruitment) rules, 1980.
the said rules which came into effect from 31.12.80 were amended twice in 1983 and 1985.
by the newly added rule 32 on 2.5.83, all provisions contained in the punjab police rules as applicable to the union territory of delhi were repealed.
while under the earlier rule 12.14.(3) of the punjab police rules, sons and near relatives of persons who have done good service in punjab police or in the army had preference in recruitment, under the new rule 9(vi)(d)(ii) relaxation of the age limit alone was provided for "for sons of police personnel who die in service".
despite this rule position, the deputy commissioner of police headquarters (i), delhi, by his order dt.3. 10.81, relaxed the rules relating to the qualifications in favour of the sons or wards of delhi 50 policemen upto the limit of 71/2% of the total selection.
accordingly the police authorities in charge of the selec tion of candidates recommended 259 candidates out of a total of 420 candidates who came within the category of wards of policemen/class iv employees to the delhi administration for seeking approval of the competent authority.
all the 23 appellants were eligible to be considered for the appointment as constables in the light of the order of relaxation dated 3.10.81, but even they were not sent up for training which they had to undergo before the appointment because six of them were found to be ineligible since their brothers had already been recruited in the police department by relaxing the rules of appointment in their favour.
15 of them were refused permission to join the training course on the ground that the administrator (lt. governor of union territory of delhi) had not relaxed the qualifications in their cases.
two of them, however, had in fact received a letter stating that the administrator (lt. governor of the union territory of delhi) had accorded sanction for relaxa tion for recruitment in their cases and they could join the training course with effect from 15.6. 1982 but later on they were also denied admission into the police force be cause their brothers had been recruited earlier in the delhi police service after according relaxation.
the order of relaxation in their favour had, therefore, been withdrawn.
the appellants who were thus aggrieved by the denial of admission into the service preferred the writ petition in the high court for the issue of writ of mandamus to the delhi administration to appoint them as constables on the ground that they satisfied the qualifications prescribed by the rules read with the order of relaxation dated 3.10.1981.
a learned single judge of the delhi high court allowed the writ petition and held that the punjab police rules, 1934 continued to remain in force even after the promulga tion of the rules which came into force on 31.12.1980 and the cases of the appellants were protected by the relaxation order dated 3.10.1981 issued by the deputy commissioner of police and the fact that any of the brothers of the appel lants had been appointed earlier under the cover of similar order of relaxation did not disentitle the appellants to claim the benefit of the order of relaxation.
aggrieved by the said decision, the union of india and the delhi administration flied a letters patent appeal.
the appeal was allowed holding; (a) that on the promulgation of the rules with effect from 31.12.1980, rule 12.14.(3) of the punjab police rules, 1934 which dealt with the subject of appointment of constables stood repealed; (b) that under rule 30 of the rules the power to relax the rules in appro priate 51 cases having been vested with the administrator.
(lt. gover nor of the union territory of delhi) the order of relaxation issued by the deputy commissioner of police on 3.10.1981 did not give any right to the appellants for enlistment as constables unless relaxation was granted by the competent authority i.e. the administrator (lt. governor of the union territory of delhi) and the mere fact that a candidate was successful in the test by itself would not give him a right to enlistment; (c) that since by its letter dated april 3, 1982 the delhi administration had decided that only one son of a police officer would be considered for grant of such relaxation the appellants whose brothers had already been employed in the police service on the basis of an earlier order of relaxation were not entitled to be recruited by relaxing the rules once again.
hence the appeal by special leave.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: 1. 1 the claim made by the appellants for the relaxation of the rules in their cases only because they happen to be the wards or children or relatives of the police officers has got to be negatived since their claim is based on 'descent ' only and others will thereby be discrimi nated against as they do not happen to be the sons of police officers.
any preference shown in the matter of public employment on the ground of descent only has to be declared as unconstitutional.
[65f g] 1.2 while it may be permissible to appoint a person who is the son of a police officer who dies in service or who is incapacitated while rendering service in the police depart ment, a provision which confers a preferential right to appointment on the children or wards or other relatives of the police officers either in service or retired merely because they happen to be the children or wards or other relatives of such police officers would be contrary to article 16 of the constitution.
opportunity to get into public service should be extended to all the citizens equal ly and should not be confined to any extent to the descend ants or relatives of a person already in the service of the state or who has retired from the service.
[64b d] gazula dasaratha rama rao vs the state of andhra pradesh 2.1 it is well settled that when a competent authority makes a new law which is totally inconsistent with the earlier law and that the two cannot stand together any longer it must be construed that the earlier law had been repealed by necessary implication by the later law.
apply 52 ing the above test it has to be held in this case that rule 12.14 and rule of the punjab police rules, 1934 stood re pealed with effect from december 31, 1980 and rule 32 of the rules which was introduced by way of amendment on may 2, 1983 had not the effect reviving rule 12.14 and rule 12. 15 of the punjab police rules, 1934 and keeping them alive beyond december 31, 1980 upto may 2, 1983.
[63a c] 2.2 rule 32 of the delhi police (appointment and re cruitment) rules, 1980 had been introduced by way of abun dant caution, although in fact the punjab police rules, 1934 ceased to be in force on 31.
12. 1980 and the mere addition of rule 32 did not have the effect of keeping the 1934 rules alive after 31.12.80.
[62d e] 2.3 section 149(2) of the no doubt provided that the rules framed under the of 1861 would continue to be in force after the act came into force in so far as they were consistent with the act but at the same time section 147 of the act authorised the administra tor (lt. governor of the union territory of delhi) to make rules regarding recruitment to, and the pay, allowances and all other conditions of service of the members of the delhi police under clause (b) of section 5.
it is not disputed that rule 12.14 and rule 12.15 of the punjab police rules, 1934 and the rules promulgated on december 31, 1980 dealt with the identical subject, namely, the appointment and recruitment of constables to the delhi police service.
therefore, on the promulgation of the rules on december 31, 1980 which covered the subject dealt with by rule 12.14 and rule 12.15 of the punjab police rules, 1934 had the effect of repealing by necessary implication rule 1,2.14 and rule 12.15 of the punjab police rules, 1934 even though initially there was no express provision in the rules to the effect that rule 12.14 and rule 12.15 of the punjab police rules, 1934 stood repealed with effect from december 31, 1980.
