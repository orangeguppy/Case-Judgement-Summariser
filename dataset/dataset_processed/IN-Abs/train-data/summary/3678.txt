this court also mentioned that the allotment of plota to 60 new metal:era who were cha racterised as very important persons appeared 372 to have been made in undue haste and the persons on the waiting list were not considered and that no notice was given to persons inviting applications.

when the writ petitions came up for final hearing along with the c.m.ps.
on 29 8 1974 this court appointed shri deb brat mukherjee as chairman of the society.
the chairman was asked to scrutinise whether any person had been either illegally brought in as a member or illegally removed having regard to the rules, the bye laws and the regulations of the society.
the chairman restored the membership of the alleged default ers and published a tentative voters ' list.
the chairman declared that out of the 60 new allottees 21 did not have applications for membership and 38 were illegally admitted and could not be included in the voters ' list.
the chairman said that the allotment of plots in their favour could not be upheld.
11 persons out of the 60 new allottees filed two c.m.ps.
in august 1976 praying for an injunction restraining the chairman from holding elections.
these applications were filed without serving any party to the proceedings contrary to the rules and practice of the court.
on 23 9 1976, the chairman submitted his report.
allowing the writ petitions, held: 1.
the date of the application, prescription of time for deposit of membership fee and the amount of qualifying shares, and the filing of the requisite declaration are formalities which cannot be disregarded.
the chairman rightly came to the conclusion that the new allottees could not be treated as members.
the new allottees were taken in without considering the persons on the waiting list.
it was incumbent on the society to act in accordance with clause 7 of the lt. governor 's award.
the managing committee took 38 persons as members unlawfully.
the declaration of default ers could not have been made except by the general body with a special majority and with the approval of the regis trar.
the nominated managing committee could not have functioned after 1st april 1973 in view of the provisions of section 92 read with section 32 of the delhi cooperative societies act 1972.
in view of the award of the lt. governor dated 6 7 1971 the committee had no jurisdiction to declare any member a defaulter.
the act of declaration of defaulters of 6 1 1974 cannot be dis associated from the enrolment of new allottees on 25th and 26th january 1974.
the report of the chairman in restoring membership to the 108 alleged defaulters is just and correct.
the circular dated 30 4 1973 issued by the nominated managing committee is not a notice within the meaning of 373 the bye laws of the society and the declaration of default ers on the basis of the circular is illegal and contrary to the bye laws of the society.
the circular was despatched after the time for payment mentioned therein was over.
no opportunity was given to a member as required by the amended bye laws to show cause why his right to a plot would not be forfeited.
the order of this court dated 6 7 1973 continued to be in force in so far as the petitionrs in raj rani 's petition are concerned.
therefore, the declaration of defaulters from amongst the petitioners in raj rani 's peti tion was unjustified.
the action of the nominated managing committee declaring defaulters was in bad faith because they wanted to confer benefits on other persons in the guise of declaration of defaulters.
[381 a b, d, e, h, the chairman rightly came to the conclusion that out of the 42 declarations of defaulters for not submitting affidavit 30 members had genuine grievances.
[384 f] the chairman rightly held that the 4 persons whose money was lying with the society should be made members.
the chairman also rightly held that the 4 persons whose lands had been acquired by the society should be accepted as members [385a b] the priority fixed by the chairmaan about allotment of plots is just.
[385 c] [the court with a view to ensuring that the persons mentioned in the chairman 's report should get the reliefs mentioned in the report held that those persons should make fresh applications with affidavits through the chairman 'and the allotment of plots should be made in accordance with the priority laid down by the chairman.]
