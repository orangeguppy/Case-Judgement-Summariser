in order to attract article 133(1)(b) the essential requirement is that there must be involved in the appeal to this court a claim or question respecting property of the value of not less than rs. 20,000/ in addition to or other than the subject matter of the dispute; if there is no question or claim raised respecting property other than the subject matter, then, clause (a) of article 133 will apply.

[94o g] the respondent had filed applications under the payment of wages act 1948, claiming overtime wages for the period 1957 to 1958 and wages for weekly off days for the period 1962 to 1963.
against the judgment of the high court setting aside the order of the appellate authority holding the claim as time barred, the appellants filled appeal to this court on the basis of a certificate issued by the high court under article 133(1)(b).

the respondents moved this court for revocation of the certificate.
they urged that what weighed with the high court 'for granting a certificate under article 133(1)(b) was the circumstance that the nature of the demands by the workmen were such as they were recurring claim arising in the future also and as such the final" judgment and order of the high court involved directly or indirectly a claim respecting property of the value not less than rs. 20,000/ and that thisview of the high court was erroneous '.

the judgment does not involve directly or indirectly, apart from/the subject matter of the writ petition, any claim or question respecting property or money of the value of rs. 2o,000/ and more.
