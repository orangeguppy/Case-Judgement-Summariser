the appellant was appointed as a clerk in the patiala state in 1948.
on the formation of the new state of punjab in 1956, the appellant was integrated in the service of the new state of punjab as permanent assistant.
the appellant overstayed leave and.
therefore, after holding an enquiry the financial commissioner.
punjab dismissed him from serv ice in october, 1959.
appellant filed two suits, one for a declaration that his dismissal order was void and illegal second for arrears of salary on the basis that the dismissal was illegal.
the trial court decreed both the suits.
the high court in appeal reversed the decrees of the trial court and dismissed the suits.
in the appeals by certificate the appellant contended that the appellant was confirmed in the state of patiala by the order of the raj pramukh.
before its integration he was governed by the patiala and east punjab states union civil services (punishment and appeal) rules 1953 which were made in exercise of powers conferred by proviso to article 309 of the constitution.
by a notification of the punjab govern ment dated 9 2 1957 the said 1953 rules were made applicable to the corresponding services from 1st november, 1956 on wards till further orders in the new state of punjab.
under the 1953 rules, the state government was the appropriate authority for dismissing members of class iii and iv.
under section 2(46) of the pepsu general clauses act, 1953.
state government means the rat pramukh.
the appellant, therefore, contended that he cannot be removed from service by any authority subordinate to the governor of punjab and since the financial commissioner is an authority subordinate to the governor.
he was not competent to pass the order of dismissal.
the respondent contended that the appointing authority for the post held by the appellant in the state of punjab is the financial commissioner and, therefore.
he is the appro priate authority under section 116(1 ) of the states reorganisa tion act, 1956 to impose the penalty of dismissal.
second ly, in the present case the punjab financial commissioner 's office (state services class iii) rules.
1957, apply.
although the said rules are more disadvantageous to the appellant since they have received the approval of the central government by the general circular dated 11 5 1957, the appellant was rightly dismissed by the financial commis sioner.
allowing the appeals.
held: 1.
section 116(1) merely provides that the appel lant shall continue to hold the same post in the new state of punjab and shall be deemed to have been duly appointed to such post by the government of punjab.
the fact that in the new state .of
punjab the financial commissioner is the appropriate authority for appointing assistants is absolute ly irrelevant.
under section 115(7) of the states reorganisation act the conditions of service applicable to 957 a civil servant immediately before the appointed day cannot be varied to his disadvantage except with the previous approval of the central government.
one of the condition of service of the appellant on the appointed day was that since he was appointed by the state government of pepsu he could only be dismissed by the state government of pepsu if he had continued there.
[961 h, 962 a] 2.
the memorandum of 11 5 1957 cannot be called in aid as previous approval because the punjab financial commis sioner 's office rules 1957 were promulgated on 28 2 1957 before the circular dated 11 5 1957 was issued.
no approval of the central government has been produced.
therefore, authority subordinate to the governor of punjab was not competent to pass an order of dismissed of the appellant.
[962 d e] the court set aside the judgment and decrees of the high court and restored those of the trial court.
