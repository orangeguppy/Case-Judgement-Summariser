in union of india vs gurnam singh ; , this court decided that under the judges were entitled to cash equivalent of leave salary in respect of the period of earned leave at their credit on the date of retirement as provided under rule 20b of the all india service (leave) rules, 1955.
the two question which arose for consideration in this petition under article 32 filed by a retired chief justice of madhya pradesh high court were (1) whether in view of the provisions of section 5(3) of the act, the limit has to be confined to five months equal to 150 days and not 180 days as in rule 20b; and (2) whether for calculating the equivalent of leave salary admissible to a judge the provisions of section 9 (1) of the act would apply ? allowing the petition and answering the questions in the negative. ^ held: the ratio of gurnam singh 's case has not been disputed.
it would necessarily mean acceptance of the position that the act did not make provision for payment of the retirement benefit contemplated under rub 20b; otherwise rule 20b could not have been applied.
for calculating the benefits under rule 20b, section 5 (3) of the act is not relevant and in case in the leave account maintained under section 4 of the act leave is due, the benefit under rule 20b has to be worked out subject to the upper limit of 180 days, equal to six months [857 b c] once it is held that the benefit under rule 20b is not controlled by chapter ii of the act, the manner of calculation indicated in section 9 (1) of the act would also not apply.
[857 e] the principles governing the cash equivalent of leave would apply not only to the petitioner but also to judges who have already retired or who may retire hereafter, from the date from which this facility was made available to the members of the central services holding the rank of secretary to the government of india or its equivalent.
