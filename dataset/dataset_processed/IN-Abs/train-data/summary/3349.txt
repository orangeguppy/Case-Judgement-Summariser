section 60 of the empowers the state transport authority to cancel or suspend a permit granted by it under certain circumstances.
the proviso to the section states that no permit shall be cancelled unless an opportunity has been given to the holder of the permit to furnish his explanation.
on receipt of reports and complaints regarding the appellant, the state transport commissioner issued a show cause notice to it without specifying therein the nature of complaints.
action was taken for cancellation of the permits.
the high court summarily dismissed the writ petition of the appellant filed under article 226 of the constitution against the order of the state transport appellate tribunal.
allowing the appeal to this court, ^ held: (1) the high court was not right in not interfering with the order of the authority cancelling the permits.
a manifestly wrong procedure in a departmental action of this nature is obvious on the face of the notice resulting in violation of the principles of natural justice.
[221d; 220a] (2) the proposed penal action has to be particularised with reference to each permit detailing the particular conditions for breach of which action is sought to be taken.
proviso to section 60(1) which requires mandatory compliance is nothing short of a reasonable opportunity to the permit holder to furnish his explanation.
unless the breaches of conditions or other allegations are particularised with reference to each permit in the show cause notice such notice is clearly invalid and no action can be taken under such a notice.
