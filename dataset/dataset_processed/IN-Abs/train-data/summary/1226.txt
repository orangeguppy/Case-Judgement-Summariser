the appellants were importers and users of glass chatons the import of which was prohibited except under a licence granted by the licensing authorities under the import and export control act, 1947, and the imports (control) order, 1955.
the import was totally prohibited for some time but afterwards it was permitted under the export promotion scheme and licence was issued in favour of the state trading corporation.
the appellants who made no application for licence contended inter alia that the provisions of para.
6(h) of the imports (control) order, 1955, that the central government or the chief controller of imports and exports may refuse to grant a licence or direct any licensing authority not to grant licence if the licensing authority decided to canalise imports and the distribution thereof through special or specialised agencies or channels are unreasonable restrictions on the right to carry on trade 863 and to acquire property and as such contravene articles 14, 19(1) (f) & (g) and 31 of the constitution.
held, that the decision that import of a particular commodity shall be canalised by a selected channel or through selected agencies is a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public.
the provisions of para.
6(h) of the imports (control) order, 1955 and section 3 of the imports and exports control act, 1947, are valid and do not contravene articles 14, 19(1)(f) and (g).
nor do they contravene article 31 of the constitution as no question of acquisition of any right arises by the refusal of a licence.
