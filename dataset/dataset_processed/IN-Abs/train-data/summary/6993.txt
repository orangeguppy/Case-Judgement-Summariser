the orissa public service commission through an advertisement dated 8.10.64 invited applications for admission of candidates to a competitive examination for selection to the posts of orissa forest service class ii service.
the 18 selected candidates were sent for training at the indian forest college during the year 1965 67.
one of the candidates, who successfully completed the training was appointed to class 11 service.
he filed a writ petition in the high court, as he was assigned in the list of gradation a rank junior to the promotees, who were confirmed by service commission after his recruitment the high court held that the recruitment to class ii service was complete only after successful completion of two years ' training in the forest college.
the appeals by special leave flied against the high courts 242 judgment were dismissed by this court.
in 1979, the respondent no. 1 (in all the present appeals) was directly recruited to the orissa state forest service class ii by the state commission.
he was appointed as an assistant conservator of forests, after his completion of training for two years at the forest service college.
respondent no. 1 moved the administrative tribunal challenging the seniority of the forest rangers, who were members of the orissa subordinate forest service and were promoted as assistant conservators of forests, when the respondent was undergoing his training.
respondent contended before the tribunal that the seniority of direct recruits vis a vis the promotees required to be decided on the basis of the orissa forest service class ii recruitment rules, 1959; that his services should be reckoned from the date of recruitment itself and not from the date of actual appointment; that the exclusion of the period of two years ' training from the purposes of reckoning the seniority was illegal; and that the appointment of the promotees in excess of the quota prescribed by the rules and in the absence of any specific order of government providing otherwise was illegal.
allowing the petition, the tribunal held that the respondent no.1 (in the present appeals) was entitled to be treated as a direct recruit of 1979 and he be confirmed and promoted on being direct recruit of 1979 and his seniority to be fixed on the basis of being a direct recruit of 1979 within the 2/3rd quota for direct recruits.
the present appeals by special leave were preferred by the aggrieved parties against the judgment of the tribunal.
the appellant in slp (c) no. 1604 of 1992 submitted that the respondent no.1 was selected for undergoing superior forest service course at the forest service college in 1979; that having regard to the terminology of the order which stated, "he was selected", it could not be held that he could lay a claim to the post; that the tribunal had gone wrong in its interpretation of the rules that having held that both the direct recruits as well as the promotees were to undergo probation for a period of two years, the period of training for the direct recruit could not count as service; that the ratio of 2/3rd and 1/3rd between direct recruits 243 and promotees did not apply, if the government provided otherwise; that the civil list corrected upto 1982 was published in 1985; and that the judgment of the tribunal resulted in unsettling the settled matters, hence same to be reversed.
the state adopted the arguments of the appellant in slp (c) no. 1604/92.
the respondent no.1 submitted that recruitment was different from appointment; that when an officer was recruited to class 11 service if did not mean that only from the date of appointment his seniority was to be reckoned, that the argument that the period of training to be excluded merely because both the direct recruits as well as the promotees undergo probation was untenable; that when rules specifically prescribed the quota as 2/3rd and 1/3rd, the government could not wriggle out of the situation that a saving provision was made which was factually not so in this case; that the point relating to laches which was never argued before the tribunal, could not be raised before the court.
allowing the appeals, this court, held, 1.01.
the term 'recruitment "connotes and clearly signifies enlistment, acceptance, selection or approval for appointment certainly, this is not actual appointment or posting in service.
in contradistinction, the word 'appointment ' means an actual act of posting a person to a particular office.
[253e] 1.02.
recruitment is just an initial process. 'mat may lead to eventual appointment in service.
but, that cannot tantamount to an appointment.
no doubt, rule 5 talks of recruitment to class 11 service.
[253e] 1.03.
nowhere in the recruitment rules of 1959 it is specified that the services of a direct recruit under the government shall be reckoned from the date of selection in the competitive examination.
on the contrary, regulation 12(c) is very clear that the period of training is not to be reckoned as government service.
[253f] 1.04.
under regulation 12 the finally selected candidates are required to undergo two years training.
during the period of pendency & consolidated monthly allowance of rs. 150 as stipend is paid.
under clause (b) of that regulation he is required to execute a bond provided for 244 in appendix a. regulation 12 (c) in unmistakable terms says the period of training will not count as service under government.
such service will count only from the date of appointment to the service after successful completion of the course of training.
[253b c] 1.05.
after the successful completion of training when the appointment order is issued the direct recruits are put on probation.
similar is in the case of the promotees.
both of them undergo probation.
[253g] 1.06.
the seniority of direct recruits will have to be reckoned only from the date of appointment and not from the date of recruitment.
[253g] 2.01.
the government had clearly taken a decision to increase the number of posts to be filled up by promotion in excess of the 1/3rd of total posts in the cadre on administrative grounds connected with nationalisation of kendu leaf trade in 1972 73 in the interest of public due to non availability of direct candidates trained in the indian forest college, dehradun.
[256g] 2.02.
it is not correct to say that government have decided that the quota of direct recruitment which will be encroached upon by the promotees will be released as and when direct recruits are available.
[256h] 2.03.
hence, to contend that the promotees would obviously have to yield to direct recruits who came in subsequently within their quota and would consequently also not be eligible for seniority above direct recruits, is untenable.
[257d] 2.04. ]me promotions given in excess of 1/3rd quota are valid.
there is no justification to push down the promotees in seniority.
the promotion in excess of the prescribed quota was necessitated by the exigencies and in the intersest of the public.
it is supported by a conscious decision of the government which is permissible under rule 5(3).

by the operation of deeming clause it only enables appointments made under 1959 rules to be continued under 1984 rules.
certainly, by the repeal of 1959 rules it cannot mean all those appointments cease.
nor again, the substantive provision of rule 16 would govern.
therefore, rule 24 has no application.
[256a b] 3.02.
since the appointments in question have been made under 1959 rules, 1984 rules will be inapplicable.
the 1984 rules, came into force only when they were published in the official gazette on december 21, 1984.
explanation under rule 16 is a substantive provision.
therefore, it cannot be retrospective.
as regards rule 24, the proviso clearly states that the rules cannot be construed as affecting on invalidating the appointments already made.
therefore, if any right has been acquired or any privilege had accrued that would remain unaltered.
therefore, these appointments which are governed by the 1959 rules will continue not withstanding the repeal.
[254h, 255a b] 3.03.
since the appointments in question are regulated under orissa forest service class 11 recruitment rules, the indian forest service (appointment by promotion) regulations of 1966 have no application.
the orissa rules were framed under proviso to article 309 of the constitution of india and have statutory and binding force.

there have been laches on the part of the direct recruits in seeking the remedy.
when the list was published in 1985 nothing prevented them to approach earlier.
this is the point to be put against them.
[258g] 4.02.
the gradation list has been in operation over several years.
there is no reason to unsettle the settled position.
