the appellant not being satisfied with the compensation offered by the land acquisition officer in respect of his land placed under acquisition under the land acquisition act, applied for a reference to a civil court, for determining the market value of the land for awarding compensation to the appellant.
the trial court determined the market value of the land in question at rs.8692 per acre.
the high court reduced the amount of compensation payable to rs.4845.87 from rs.8692 per acre.
the appellant moved this court for relief, complaining that the high court had erroneously revised downwards the valuation correctly arrived at by the trial court.
allowing the appeal partly, the court ^ held: the trial court had virtually treated the award rendered by the land acquisition officer as a judgment under appeal.
the court laid down general guidelines to be followed in respect of methodology for valuation, in order to capsulize the true position.
[534e] f the valuation made by the high court had been faulted on three grounds: (1) the high court should not have made a deduction of 25% in place of deduction made by the trial court at 20% to account for the factor pertaining to largeness of the block of land under acquisition.
[539b] (2) the high court had grossly under valued the land in determining the market value of the appellant 's land at rs.7000 per acre as a block.
[539b c] 532 (3) there was no warrant for pushing down or depressing the market value of land as determined by the trial court in order to deduce the 'present value ' by reference to miram 's tables to account for the factor as regards the estimated time lag for development reaching the block of land in question which was situated in the interior.
besides, the time lag of 12 years as estimated by the high court was excessive and unrealistic.
[539c d] the first two grounds were devoid of merit.
it was not possible to find fault with the reasoning or conclusion of the high court.
the high court was regularly engaged in valuation of the lands in different parts of the state and was fully aware of the landscape.
it had made the estimate as regards the time lag for development to reach the appellant 's land to the best of its judgment, and having taken into account all the relevant factors, it had arrived at its determination.
the high court had not committed any error or violated any principle of valuation.
it was purely a question of fact and it was not possible to detect any error even in the factual findings recorded by the high court.
there was no material on the basis on which the plea of the appellant could be upheld that the valuation of rs.7000 per acre did not reflect the true market value or that the land in question was undervalued.
[541b f] the appellant 's grievance with regard to the third ground was justified.
the appellant 's parcel of land in question, situated very much in the interior, was valued by the trial court at ks.
l0,866 per acre (less 20% for roads, etc.).
the high court valued this parcel of land at rs.7,000 per acre.
it had valued the land with the best situation on the ganeshkhand road at rs.20,000 per acre.
as against this, the appellant 's land was valued at rs.7,000 per acre.
this pushing down was made to account for its situation in the interior on the premise that development would take about 12 years to reach the appellant 's land under acquisition.
but after 12 years, it would become land adjoining the developed area and not land which could be treated as in the interior.
if the present value was to be ascertained, it should be ascertained on the basis of present value of land which would fetch rs.20,000 per acre after 12 years and not present value of land which would fetch rs.7,000 per acre after 12 years.
in fact the present value of rs.20,000 payable at the end of 12 years at 8% would work out to rs.6942 according to miram 's table 7, p.657 of a.k. mitra 's theory and practice of valuation 2nd edition.
the high court was right in valuing the land in interior at rs.7,000 per acre but wrong in directing that present value of rs.7,000 payable after 12 years should be ascertained.
the appellant must be awarded compensation at rs.7,000 533 per acre subject to deduction or allowance of 25% to account for land required to be set apart for roads, open spaces, etc.
the appellant would be entitled to be paid compensation for his land in question at rs.5250 per acre (rs.7,000 less 25%) in place of lesser amount awarded by the high court.
[541f h; 542a f] the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of the central amending act 68 of 1984 in view of section 30(2) of the act because these appeals were pending before this court on 30th april, 1982, if the view is taken that the said act had retrospective operation in the sense that the amended section 23(2) and section 28 apply also in relation to an order under appeal against an award made by the collector or court between april 30, 1982 and the commencement of the amending act.
this must depend upon the decision of the constitution bench of this court, expected soon; the appellant would be entitled to the benefit as above said if the constitution bench upholds the view expressed in bhag singh case, (1985) 3 scc p. 737 and overrules the view expressed in kamalajamanniavaru case, [542g h; 543a b]
