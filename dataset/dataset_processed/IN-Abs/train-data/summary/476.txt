the appellant and four others were being tried before the presidency magistrate, bombay for charges under section 161 read with 116 and further read with section 109 or section 114 of the indian penal code.
during the pendency of the trial the criminal law amendment act, 952 (xlvi of 1952) was enacted by parliament and came into force on july 28, 952.
the act provided for the trial of all offences punishable under sections 161, 165 or 165 a, of the indian penal code, or sub section
(2) of section 5, of the prevention of corruption act, 1947 exclusively by special judges and directed the transfer of all such trials pending on the date of the coming (1) ; 679 into force of the act to special judges.
the presidency magistrate continued the trial and acquitted the appellant.
upon appeal by the state government, the high court held that from the date of the commencement of the act the presidency magistrate lost all jurisdiction to continue the trial and ordered a retrial by the special judge.
it was contended that the act was void as it violated article 14 of the constitution and consequently could not affect the jurisdiction of the presidency magistrate to continue the trial.
held, that the act did not violate article 14 of the constitution.
the legislature classified the offences punishable under sections 161, 165 or 165 a of the indian penal code or sub section 2 of section 5 of the prevention of corruption act, 1947 in one group or category.
they were offences relating to bribery or corruption by public servants and were appropriately classified in one group or category.
the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguished the offenders thus grouped together from those left out of the group.
this intelligible differentia had rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the act, the object being to provide for speedier trials of the said offences.
bribery and corruption having been rampant and the need for weeding them out having been urgently felt, it was necessary to enact the measure for the purpose of eliminating all possible delay in bringing the offenders to book.
the state of bombay vs f. n. balsara, (195i) s.c.r. 682, budhan chowdhary others vs the state of bihar, (1955) s.c.r.1945 and kedar nath bajoria vs the state of west bengal, (1954) s.c.r 30, applied.
there is no doubt that the case of the appellant was not concluded and was pending before the presidency magistrate on july 28, 1952, the date of the commencement of the act.
the fact that the special judge was not appointed until september 26, 1952, on which date the arguments for the prosecution and the defence were concluded did not affect the position.
even if it be assumed that the act did not effectively commence until the special judge was appointed by the notification of september 26, 1952, which came into effect immediately after the midnight of september 25, 1952, the trial of the appellant could not be said to have concluded before that, for a trial is not complete until either the sentence has been passed or the accused has been ordered to be discharged.
