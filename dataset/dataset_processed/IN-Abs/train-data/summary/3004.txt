the loans granted under the travancore land improvement and agricultural loans regulation ix of 1094 together with interest and charges etc.
can be recovered from the borrowers under cl.
(a) of section 7(1) of the regulation, as arrears of land revenue due by him or in any of the other modes prescribed by cls.
(b), (c) and (d) of the section.
the fact that the properties which had been sold were not mentioned in the bond as collateral security or were not expressly hypothecated does not make any difference, because, travancore revenue recovery act 1 of 1068 (m.e.) provides under section 5 "when public revenue due on loan may be in arrear, such arrear, together with interest if any and cost and process may be recovered by the sale of the defaulter 's movable or immovable property or both in the manner hereinafter provided." further, it is not necessary for the borrower to specifically so covenant in his bond that he would be personally liable, because, section 7(1) (a) of the regulation makes the borrower personally liable.
this is also made clear by sub section
(2) under which if a surety pays the loan he can request that the money be recovered from the borrower on his behalf.
