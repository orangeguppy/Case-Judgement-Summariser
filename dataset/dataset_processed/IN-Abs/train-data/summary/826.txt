in ascertaining the surplus available for the payment of bonus according to the full bench formula the industrial court allowed the statutory depreciation but did not give any credit for the rehabilitation amount claimed.
the industrial court estimated the amount required for rehabilitation at rs. 60 lakhs; out of this amount it deducted rs. 51 lakhs representing the reserves and the balance of rs. 9 lakhs spread over a period of 15 years gave the figure of rs. 6o,000 as the amount that should be set apart for the year in question for rehabilitation.
this amount being less than the statutory depreciation the industrial court held that the appellant was not entitled to any deduction on account of rehabilitation as a prior charge.
the appellant contended that the balance sheet disclosed that the entire reserves had been used as working capital and consequently the said reserves should not be excluded from the amount claimed towards rehabilitation.
held, that the appellant had failed to prove that the reserves had in fact been used as working capital and as such the amount was rightly deducted by the industrial court from the amount fixed for rehabilitation.
