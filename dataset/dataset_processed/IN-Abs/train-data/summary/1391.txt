the assessee company owned a fleet of buses and carried on the business of transport.
the income tax officer disallowed development rebate on the transport vehicles owned by the company as provided by the second proviso to section 10(2) (vi b) of the income tax act.
the company challenged the section on the ground that the said proviso offends article 14 in that it discriminates between machinery which is office appliances or road transport vehicles and other kinds of machinery.
^ held, that there is nothing in the constitution which prevents the legislature from choosing the objects of taxation from amongst various classes of machinery for purpose of giving development rebate.
