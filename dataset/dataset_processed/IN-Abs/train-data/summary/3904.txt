in suits filed by the appellants for refund of the amounts which they claimed were collected without authority of law, the respondent board pleaded that the levy was in accordance with law and that the suits where barred by limitation.
the trial court decreed the suits and on appeal the district judge affirmed the trial court 's decrees.
in second appeal the high court held that the levy was illegal.
the high court, however, allowed the appeals in respect of those amounts which were found to be within limitation under section 179(2) of the act and dismissed the others.
