the high court was right in holding that none of the conditions for grant of recognition to teachers training institutes prescribed under the tamil nadu minority schools (recognition and payment of grants) rules, 1977, infracted articles 14 & 30(1) of the constitution.

2.2 it is entirely for the state government and not for this court, to lay down the requirements of a teachers training institute campus.
all those institutes which did not have permanent recognition before the issue of the recognition rules, 1977 are bound to comply with the said conditions before they are entitled to permanent recognition.
the high court was justified in holding that the institutions which were operating on the basis of temporary recognitions, either under the orders of the courts or otherwise, shall have to comply with the recognition rules to enable them to earn recognition.
these institutions are neither properly, organised nor fully, equipped to train the teachers.
and have done more harm than good to the cause of education.
3.1 in view of the series of the judgments of this court the courts should not issue fiat to allow the students of unrecognised institutions to appear the different examinations pending the disposal of the writ applications.
such interim orders affect the career of several students and cause unnecessary embarrassment and harassment to the authorities, who have to comply with such directions of the courts.

3.2 the high court should not have passed interim orders directing authorities concerned to allow the teachers of unrecognised institutions to appear at the examinations.
it is a matter of common knowledge that many institutions claiming themselves to be minority institutions within the meaning of article 30(1) of the constitution invoke the jurisdiction of the high court under article 226 or of this court under article 32 for a writ of mandamus to recognise the institutions as minority institutions only when the dates for examinations are notified and, as a part of strategy, seek directions to allow, meanwhile, the students to appear at the examinations.
many of such institutions are not only "masked phantoms" but are established as business ventures for admitting sub standard students without any competitive tests, on basis of considerations which cannot serve even the interest of the minority.
the teachers of such institutions cannot derive any benefit on basis of interim orders when ultimately the main writ applications have been dismissed.
as such no equity or legal right can be pleaded on behalf of the students admitted for traning by such minority institutions for publication of their results or award of certificates.
