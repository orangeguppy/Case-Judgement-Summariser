in the petition filed under article 32 of the constitution of india, the petitioners teachers, employed in the schools run by the respondents, controlled by the defence department of the government of india, contended that the action of the respondents in retiring them at the age of 58 years, whereas retaining similarly situated teachers working in other departments upto the age of 60 years was discriminatory and violative of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution.

dismissing the petition, this court, held: with effect from april 1, 1989 the age of superannuation of all teachers working in central government departments and organisations including union territories has been uniformly fixed at 58 years.
