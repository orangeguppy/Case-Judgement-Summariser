on the question whether an amount representing the interest on the amount of the assessee 's own contributions to an unrecognised provident fund was assessable under the residuary section 56 of the income tax act, 1961, held : the amount was liable to be assessed.
the receipt of an interest of any investment is a gain made by the investor and therefore the same is 'income '.
in view of section 17 ( 1) (iv), all receipts of profits in lieu of salary have to be considered as salary.
in defining the expression 'profits in lieu of salary ', the legislature excluded from the scope of that expression any payments received by the assessee from a provident fund, his own con tribution,; to the fund or any interest on such contributions.
therefore this receipt cannot be considered as salary, though undoubtedly that is an income.
as the income in question is not salary and the same cannot be said to be either interest on the securities; income from house property, profits and gains of business of profession or capital gains, it has to be considered as 'income from other sources ' and brought to tax under section 56.
section 56(1) provides that income of every kind which is not to be ex cluded from the total income under the act shall be chargeable to incometax under any of the heads specified in section; 14 item "a" to "e".
