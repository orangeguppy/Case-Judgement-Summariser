section 9 read with third schedule item 7 of the kerala general sales tax act 1963 granted exemption from sales tax to certain items including cotton fabrics.
`cotton fabrics ' was defined as having the same meaning as assigned to it in item 19 of the first schedule to the .
this definition of `cotton fabrics ' in 1944 act was amended in 1969 by the finance act 1969.
in 1957, parliament enacted the and additional duties of excise ((goods of special importance) act, 1957 affecting the levy of sales tax and excise duty.
definition of `cotton fabrics ' occurring in the aforesaid acts was also related to its definition under the 1944 act.
the respondent assessee was manufacturing pvc cloth, an item of goods which was clearly covered by the amended definition but, perhaps, not by the original one.
he claimed exemption from sales tax in respect of assessment years 1971 72 and 1972 73.
on a reference made to the high court under the 1963 act, it observed that the concept of `cotton fabrics ' in the seemed to be integrally linked with the provisions of the (general sales tax act) the act under which the levy of sales tax was governed, prior to enforcement of the 1963 act), and that it would not be regarding the latter act as unaffected by the growing concept of the term `cotton fabrics ' in the central excise pg no 601 pg no 602 and salt act, and that unless the extended definition of the imported into the sales tax act, the latter act would become unworkable and ineffectual.
in the appeals by certificate to this court, it was submitted on behalf of the state appellant that the pvc cloth manufactured by respondent was not entitled to exemption from sales tax if the earlier definition of the 1944 act, before the amendment, was to apply, and that the 1963 act has incorporated in its third schedule the definition of the 1944 act as it stood at the time of its enactment and that this incorporation is unaffected by the subsequent changes made in the 1944 act, that the concept of `cotton fabrics ' in the 1944 and 1963 acts were not integrally linked and that it is not appropriate to say that unless the extended definition of the former were imported into the latter, the latter act would become unworkable and ineffectual.
on the question whether the exemption given to `cotton fabrics ' in item 7 should be restricted to `cotton fabrics ' as defined in the 1944 act as it stood on 1.4.1963 or whether it would also cover goods falling under the said definition after its amendment in 1969.
dismissing the appeals, this court, held: ( 1 ) it would be correct to say that the 1963 act brings in the definitions of the 1944 act by way of reference or citation and not by way of incorporation.
for a reading of the act shows that the act intended to confer exemption on a number of goods set out in the schedule.
of these, since items 5 to 7 are defined in the 1944, act, the act referes to those definitions to ascertain the scope of these items.
there are no express words used by the statute which will justify an inference that the intention was to incorporate those definitions, standing on that date into the 1963 act.

pg no 603 (2) `silk fabrics ' as defined in item 20 of the 1944 act was included in 1961 in the cst act and the 1957 act.
the fact that `cotton fabrics ' though listed as item 12 in the schedule to the 1944 act was not brought into the list in section 14 till 1.10.1958 or that `silk fabrics ' was dropped from the list in section 14 w.e.f. 11.6.1968 though it continues in the schedule to the 1944 act does not alter the position that these three acts are inter connected and that certain goods taken out from the schedule to the 1944 act were to be subjected to the special treatment outlined in the cst act and the 1957 act.[615a b] (3) though the 1963 act referred only to the definitions in the 1944 act, the entries in the schedule have to be juxtaposed into the broad pattern or scheme evolved by the 1956 57 enactments.
even assuming that the reference in the items of the schedule to the definitions in the 1944 act is by way of incorporation and not reference, one cannot escape the conclusion that the circumstances are covered by the exceptions outlined in the decision of this court in state of madhya pradesh vs narasimhan! ; they certainly fall within the scope of exception (a) mentioned therein and also fall within exception (c) if `unworkable and ineffectual ' are read to take in also `unrealistic and impractical '.
[616d e] (3) the 1963 act on a proper constructions does indicate a policy that certain; items which arc subject to additional excise duty should be left out of sales tax levy except in cases where there is a specific indication or provision of the act to the contrary.
the kerala state legislature cannot be said to have attracted the 1944 act definition with their future amendments blindly and without application of mind.
on the other hand, it has been done in pursuance of a scheme, a purpose and a policy.
it cannot, therefore.
be said that there has been any abdication of its legislative functions by the kerala legislature.

(5) the high court was right in the view it took viz., that the scope of the exemption available under item 7 of the third schedule to the 1963 act will vary according to the scope of the corresponding entry in the schedule to the 1944 act as it stands at the relevant time.
so far as assessment years 1971 72 and 1972 73 are concerned the definition of cotton fabrics in item 19 of the schedule to pg no 604 the 1944 act, as amended by the finance act 1969 w.e.f. 1.4.1969, will apply.
