in 1869 the british government and the state of tonk entered into a treaty which provided for the extradition of offenders in respect of certain offences specified therein called "heinous offences," which did not include the of fences of cheating and extortion.
in 1903 the indian extradition act was passed which provided for extradition in respect of cheating and extortion also, but section 18 of the act provided that nothing contained in the act "shall derogate from the provisions of any treaty for the extradition of offenders.
" under the independence of india act, 1947, the suzerainty of his majesty over the indian states lapsed and with it all treaties and agreements in force; but under a "standstill agreement," between the indian dominion and the states (including tonk) all agreements between his majesty and the states were continued, including agreements in respect of extradition.

the appellant was a member of the uttar pradesh civil service and his services were lent to the state of tonk in 1948.

j. concurring), even assuming that the extradition treaty of 1869 subsisted after the merger of the tonk state, by providing for extradition for additional offences the extradition act of 1903 did not derogate from the provisions of the treaty of 5869 or the rights of indian citizens thereunder, and the arrest and surrender of the appellant under section 7 of the act was not, therefore, rendered unlawful by anything contained in the said treaty.

concur ring).
the extradition treaty of 1869 was not capable of being given effect to in view of the merger of the tonk state in the united state of rajasthan, and, as no enforce able treaty right existed, section 18 of the extradition act of 1903 had no application; and inasmuch as the conditions of section 7 of the said act had been complied with, the warrant of arrest issued under section 7 of the act was not illegal.
