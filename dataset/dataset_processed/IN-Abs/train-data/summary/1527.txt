the appellant was found in possession of large quantities of absorbent cotton wool, roller bandages and gauze which he had manufactured.
on analysis these were found to be sub standard and the appellant was prosecuted under section 18 of the drugs act, 1940, for manufacturing sub standard drugs.
he was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of rs. 500/.
the appellant contended that these articles were not drugs as defined in section 3(b) of the act and that the sentence imposed was too severe.
held, that absorbent cotton wool, roller bandages and gauze were "drugs" within the meaning of section 3(b) and the appellant was rightly convicted.
in the definition "drugs" "included substances intended to be used for or in treatment of diseases".
"substances" was something other than "medicines" and meant "things".
the said articles were sterilized or otherwise treated to make them disinfectant; they were used for surgical dressings and were essential materials for treatment in surgical cases.
the object of the act of maintaining high standards of medical treatment would be defeated if the necessary concomitants of medical or surgical treatment were allowed to be diluted.
held, further,that the sentence erred on the side of leniency rather than severity and could not be reduced.
it was a case where large quantities of spurious and sub standard drugs had been manufactured by the appellant.
he was guilty of an antisocial act of a very serious nature.
