the respondent made an application against the appellant under section 14 of the delhi rent control act.
in reply the appellant pleaded 182 that the respondent had no right to recover rent from him as a notice under section 46(5a) of the indian income tax act had been issued by the income tax officer, that the respondent had no locus standi as the property was in the custody of the court and a receiver had been appointed and that his professional fees were agreed and be adjusted towards the rent dues.
the rent controller recorded the statement of the appellant and after hearing arguments directed the appellant under section 15(1) of the delhi rent control act, 1958 to deposit back rents at rs. 300/ per month.
on appeal the decision of the rent controller was affirmed, and a further appeal to the high court also failed.
the appellant contended that the order under section 15(1) for deposit of rent could only be made at the end of the case and not at an interlocutory stage.
held:(i) that the order under sub section
(1) of section 15 is not a final order but is preliminary to the trial of the case and is made only wherer the rent has in fact not been paid.
for the purpose of an interim order it was not necessary that there should have been a fun trial and, that this was clear from the latter part of sub section
(1) of section 15 because under it not only the arrears have to be deposited but rent as it falls due has to be deposited month by month by the 15th of each succeeding month.

(ii)the notice under section 46(5a) of the income tax act did not amount to a garnishee order and the appellant could make payment to the rent controller without incurring personal liability because the rent controller had stated in his order that the amount would not be paid to any one till a clearance certificate was obtained from the income tax department.
