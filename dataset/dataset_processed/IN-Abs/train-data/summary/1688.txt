the municipality filed two suits to claim refund of two sum of money paid by them to the respondent no. 1 under protest a, electricity charges.
the defence of the respondent no. 1 was that the dispute between it and the municipality was decided by the government of bombay and that under the second proviso to cl. 5 of the surcharge order, 1944 the decision of the government was final and binding both on the appellant and the respondent no. 1.
the decision of the government was communicates to the parties by the letter dated may 22, 1946.
the appellant succeeded in both the suits in the trial court as well as the district 906 court.
in second appeal, the high court dismissed the two units.
hence this appeal.
held: (i) the municipality was not entitled to claim fund because the dispute between the parties had been decided by the government under the second proviso to cl. 5 of the surcharge order, 1944.
the decision of the government was final and binding on the parties.
(ii) the communication dated may 22,1946 sent by the govern ment to both the parties was a final decision under the second proviso to cl. 5 of the surcharge order, 1944.
there is no reason to think that the communication contains nothing but the opinion of the government.
(iii) the second proviso to cl.
5 of the surcharge order does not require that the dispute has to be referred by both the parties.
such a dispute can be referred by one of the parties as clear from the language of the proviso which says "in the event of dispute by any party interested" the decision of the provincial government shall be final.
(iv) the trial court and the district court had wholly mis construed the document dated may 22, 1946 which is not merely of evidentiary value but is one upon which the claim of the respondent no. 1 for the surcharge is based.
misconstruction of such document would thus be an error of law and the high court in second appeal would be entitled to correct it.
