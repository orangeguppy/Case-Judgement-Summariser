the respondent, a licencee under floe karnataka excise act for selling liquor at an approved shop, flied a writ peti tion before the high court challenging the vires of section 23(d) of the mysore excise act, 1965 and rule 8(1) of the karnataka excise (sale of indian and foreign liquors) rules, 1968 as being beyond the legislative competence of the state.
the high court negatived the contention of the respond ent in respect of section 23(d) of the act but held that rule 8(1) authorising tihe levy of licence fee for retail shop was without authority of law and dircted refund of the levy collected for three years prior to the filing of tiwrit petition.
aggrieved by the high court 's decision, the appellant state has preferred the present appeal by special leave.
dismissing the appeal, this court, held: the high court rightly did not accept the chal lenge to section 23(d) of the mysore excise act, 1965.
what is authorised under section 23(d) is imposition of a fee of licence in respect of manufacture or sale of any excisable articles.
rule 8(1) of the karnataka excise (sale of iadion & foreign liquors) rules, 1968 has obviously gone beyond the enabling provision in the section by requiring a licence fee to be paid for the premises where the licensed shop is located.
such a fee would not have the support of section 23(d).
it is unnecessary to refer to precedents for support for this conclusion.
it may be possible for the legisla 701 ture to make a statutory provision for a liicence fee of the type contemplated under the rules but without authority of the statute a rule of this type should not have been made.
