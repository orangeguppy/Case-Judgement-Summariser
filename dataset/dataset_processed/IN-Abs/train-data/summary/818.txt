the petitioner who was doing business in tobacco was charged with the contravention of rules 151(c) and 226 of the central excise rules, 1944, framed under the .
the collector finding the charges to be proved ordered confiscation of the goods found in the petitioner 's warehouse and levied duty thereon in lieu of confiscation and also imposed a penalty of rs.
2,000.
the petitioner challenged the validity of the orders on the grounds, inter alia, that sections 6 and 8 of the act and the rules made thereunder were beyond the legislative competence of the central legislature in view of the fact that though the provisions of the act which provided for the levy of excise duties might fall within item 45 of list 1 read with section 100 of the government of india act, 1935, the act in question would also be covered by items 27 and 29, of list 11, as the possession and trade in tobacco were also regulated, and would, to that extent, be ultra vires.
363 held, that the various provisions of the , and the rules made thereunder were essentially connected with the levying and collection of excise duty and in its true nature and character the act remained one under item 45 of list 1 and that the incidental trenching upon the provincial field of items 27 or 29 of list 11 would not affect its constitutionality.
it is within the competence of the central legislature to provide for matters which may otherwise fall within the competence of the provincial legislature if they are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the central legislature on a subject of legislation expressly within its power.
