the respondent, a scheduled bank, sued the appellant for recovery of money under a mortgage.
the appellant claimed reduction of the debt under the uttar pradesh zamindari debt reduction act, 1953.
an advance or debt due to a scheduled bank was excluded from the definition of "debt" given in the act.
the appellant contended that the definition in so far as it excluded certain debts offended article 14 of the constitution as it made an arbitrary distinction between several classes of debtors.
the appellant applied to the court under the proviso to section 113 of the code of civil procedure praying that a case be stated for the opinion of the high court as to the validity of the impugned portion of the definition.
the court rejected the application.
the appellant made an application in revision to the high court and also an application under article 228 of the constitution for withdrawing the case for a decision of the question of the validity of the definition.
the high court dismissed the applications.
the courts below held that in either view of the question as to the validity of the impugned portion of the definition, the appellant would be left without the remedy which he sought, because that portion of the definition was not severable from the rest and the whole definition would have to be excluded and therefore it was not necessary to decide that question to dispose of the case 1151 held, that the question raised by the appellant came both within the proviso to section 113 of the code and article 228 of the constitution.
the question whether the impugned part of the definition contravened article 14 was a question as to the interpretation of the constitution and that question must be decided first.
the question of severability could arise only after that question had been decided and the impugned part held invalid.
