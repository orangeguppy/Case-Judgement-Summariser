the rule of equality does not mean mathematical equality.
it permits of practical inequalities.
what is needed is that the selection of quota seekers as in the instant case should have a rational relation lo the object sought lo be achieved in the industrial policy decision of the state.
if the selection or differentiation is arbitrary and lacks a rational basis it offends article 14.
[849 d] 3.
"equality before the law" or "equal protection of the laws` ' within the meaning of article 14 of the constitution of india means absence of any arbitrary discrimination by the law or in their administration.
no undue favour to one or hostile discrimination to another should be shown.
a classification is reasonable when it is not an arbitrary selection but rests on differences pertinent to the subject in respect of which the classification is made.
the classification permissible must be based on some real and substantial distinction, a just and reasonable relation to the objects sought to be attained and cannot be made arbitrary and without any substantial basis.
