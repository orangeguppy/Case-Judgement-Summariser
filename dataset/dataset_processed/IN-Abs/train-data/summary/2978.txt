the respondents were lessees of the appellants for a period of 5 years from march 1, 1943.
they were protected tenants under the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act, 1948.
they contended that the appellants landlords could not claim eviction, because, being protected tenants their lease was extended by statute up to february 28, 1953, and as a result of the amendment of section 5 of the 1948 act by amending act of 1952 the period of lease was further extended upto february 28, 1963.
on the question whether a protected tenant could claim the benefit of section 5 as amended by amending act of 1952, held : section 5 of the 1948 act as amended in 1952 did not apply to protected tenancy.
the principal reason was that the tenancy of a protected tenant under the 1948 act was of unlimited time.
whereas a tenant other than a protected tenant had a security only for 10 years and it was only under section 5 as amended in 1952 that a tenant other than a protected tenant became entitled to renewal of the tenancy for a period of 10 years in succes sion as mentioned in the said section.
any such renewal, for periods of ten years, of a protected tenancy, would be destructive of the protected tenant 's unlimited security as to duration of tenancy.
secondly, if section 5 as amended in 1952 applied to protected tenants the manner of termination of tenancy mentioned in section 5, namely, by giving one year 's notice in writing before the end of each period of ten years would have been totally inconsistent with the manner of termination of tenancy of a protected tenant.
the tenancy of a protected tenant could be terminated by one year 's notice on the grounds mentioned in section 34 whereas the tenancy of one other than a protected tenant, could be terminated on the grounds mentioned in section 34(1) only at the end of each period of ten years.
thirdly, if the word tenancy occurring in s.5as amended in 1952 related to protected tenancy the words "as if such atenant was a protected tenant in section 5(2) would not have been necessary".
and finally, section 5 as amended in 1952 was in ch.
ii which contained general provisions regarding tenancies and sections 31 and 34 of 1948 act which related, to protected tenants occurred in ch.
iii of the 1958 act.
