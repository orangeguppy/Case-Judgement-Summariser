the respondent 's application under section 15 of the u.p. motor vehicles taxation act for exemption of tax in respect of his motor vehicle was rejected by the taxation officer by his letter dated october 20/24, 1964 and this was received by him on october 29, 1964.
the limitation for filing an appeal is 30 days.
on the question whether the period of limitation starts from the date of the order or the date of communication of the order.
dismissing the appeal, ^ held: apart from the reasons given by this court in raja harish chandra raj singh vs the deputy land acquisition officer & anr. [1962] 1 scr 676 that an order must be made known either directly or constructively to the party affected by it to enable him to prefer an appeal, mere writing of an order in the file kept in the office of the taxation officer is no order in the eye of law in the sense of affecting the rights of the parties for whom the order is meant.
the order must be communicated directly or constructively in the sense of making it known, which may make it possible for the authority to say that the party affected must be deemed to have known the order.
generally speaking the order would be effective only when it comes to his knowledge directly or constructively, otherwise not.
[132e g] in the instant case the respondent had no means to know the order of the taxation officer until he received his letter on the 29th october 1964.
that was the date from which the starting point of limitation for preferring an appeal commenced.
