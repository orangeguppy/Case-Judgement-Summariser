the appellant filed this appeal before this court by way of special leave.
on the question, whether on the facts of the case, the appellant accused can claim right of private defence, allowing the appeal, this court, held:1.
it is established on the record that the appellant 's father was being given lathi blows by the complainant party and it was at that time that gun shot was fired by the appellant to save his father from further blows.
a lathi is capable of causing a simple as well as a fatal injury.
whether in fact the injuries actually caused were simple or grievous is of no consequence.
it is the scenario of a father being given lathi blows which has to be kept in mind.
in such a situation a son could reasonably apprehend danger to the life of his father and his firing a gun shot at that point of time in defence of his father is justified.
the appellant fired the gun shot to defend the person of his father.
[470 e g] 2.
using the licensed gun of his father under the circumstances of the case cannot be considered possessing an arm without a licence.
the high court grossly erred in setting aside the acquittal of the appellant under section 25 a of the arms act.
