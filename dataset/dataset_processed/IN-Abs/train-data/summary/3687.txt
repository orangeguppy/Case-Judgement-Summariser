the mysore ordinance 4 of 1970 which came into effect from 7th august 1970 omitted the words "or police" in section 60(b) of the mysore excise act, 1965 which provided for taking of cognizance by the magistrate "on his own knowledge or suspicion or on the complaint or report of an excise or police officer".
it also inserted a new section 60b whereby offence under section 34 was made cognizable and the provisions of the criminal procedure code 1898 with respect to cogniz.
able offences made applicable to such offence.
the earlier position which obtained prior to the said ordinance was restored by the mysore amendment act no. 1 of 1971 which received the president 's assent on 20th january 1971 but which was deemed to have come into force on 7th august 1970.
section 23 of the 1971 act provided that the amendment to section 60 made by the ordinance of 1970 shall be deemed never to have been made and the provisions of section 60 as they stood prior to the said amendment shall be deemed to continue to be in force.
the judicial magistrate, badami, on a complaint filed by a police officer refused to take cognizance of an offence for the illegal possession of 41/2 tolas of ganja under section 34 of the mysore excise act 1965 in view of the provisions if section 60(b) ibid which represented the law as it then stood.
the revision application before the sessions court was dismissed on 15 1 1971.
a further revision filed before the high court on 14 6 1971 was also dismissed in limine.
however after the dismissal of the revision by the high court on a fresh complaint filed by the police in respect of the same offence as per the amending act i of 1971, the judicial magistrate took cognizance of the of fence, convicted the accused and sentenced hun to simple imprisonment for three months and also to pay a fine of rs. 100/ .
notwithstanding the conviction the state pressed its appeal by special leave against the judgment of the high court dismissing the revision.
allowing the appeal, the court, held: (1) the high court as well as the court of ses sions were clearly in error in affirming the order made by the learned judicial magistrate.
[547a] (2) the charge sheet was validly filed before the learned judicial magistrate by the police and the judicial magistrate was entitled to take cognizance of the offence on the basis of such charge sheet.
[547a b] (3) the result of the enactment of section 23 by mysore act i of 1971 was that the amendment made in section 60 clause (b) by deleting the words "or police" by mysore ordinance no. 4 of 1970 as oblitarated and wiped out with retrospective effect so that in the eye of the law it was never made at all.
[546f] (4) it is now well settled law that when a legal fiction is enacted by the legislature the court should not allow its imagination to boggle but must carry the legal fiction to its logical extent and give full effect to it.
the clear effect of the legal fiction enacted in section 23 of mysore act no. 1 of 1971 was that the 545 words "or police" were always there in cl.
(b) of section 60 even at the time when the charge sheet was presented before the learned magistrate and if that be so, the learned magistrate was in error in refusing to take cognizance of the complaint on the ground that the charge sheet was not filed by an excise officer but by the police.
