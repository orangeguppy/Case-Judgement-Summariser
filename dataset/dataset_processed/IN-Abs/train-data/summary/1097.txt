m who had gone to pakistan in 1947, sold his property in the state of madras to the appellant on august ii, 1949.
at that time there was no legislation with respect to evacuee property in madras.
on august 23, 1949, the administration of evacuee property (chief commissioners provinces) ordinance, 1949 (xii of 1949), was extended to madras.
the appellant made an application for the confirmation of the sale.
subsequently, m was declared an evacuee and the property as evacuee property.
it was found that m had entered into the transaction with the object of evading the evacuee law which it was apprehended, would be extended to madras.
consequently, confirmation of the sale was refused under section 40(4)(a) of the administration of evacuaee 449 property act, 950, on the ground that the transaction had not been entered into in good faith.
the appellant contended that there was no lack of good faith on the part of m as he could not be said to have acted dishonestly when at the time of the sale no evacuee law had been applied to madras and that an intention to avoid a future law could not be said to be dishonest.
held, that the vendor had not entered into the transaction in " good faith " and the confirmation of the sale was rightly refused under section 40(4)(a) of the act.
having regard to the aim and object of the emergency legislation a deliberate intention to defeat the apprehended evacuee law motivating a sale amounted to want of " good faith ".
if the vendor sold his property not for any necessity or any other legitimate purpose but solely with the object of converting it into cash and removing it to pakistan, he intended to defeat the provisions of the evacuee law which he knew was to be extended to madras soon and he acted dishonestly within the meaning of section 40(4)(a).
