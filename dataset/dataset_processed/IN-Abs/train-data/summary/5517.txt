the petitioners challenged before the high court the validity of a notification issued by the lt. governor of delhi for the acquisition of lands in delhi for "planned development of delhi".
the high court decided against the petitioners.
the petitioners moved this court by special leave.
notice was issued by the court to the respondents on a limited point whether the lt. governor is competent to issue a notification under section 4(1) of the land acquisition act, 1894 for the acquisition of the lands for the "planned development of delhi.
" dismissing the petitions for special leave, the court, held: considering the notifications dated 19.8.1954, 1.11.56 and 7 9 66 issued by the ministry of home affairs of the government of india under article 239 (1) of the constitution of india, the lt. governor of delhi is entitled to exercise the powers of the central government in delhi under the provisions of the land acquisition act and he was competent to issue the notification impugned.
the argument that after the enactment of the delhi development act, 1957, the provisions of the land acquisition act are no longer relevant in the present context and the lt. governor has no jurisdiction or competence to issue the notification in question, is not right.
it is no doubt true that the delhi development act makes a separate mention of the central government and the administrator of the union territory and demarcates some functions between the central government and the administrator, but there can be no doubt that in the context of section 15 of the delhi development act, it would not be correct to understand these two expressions in different senses.
the delhi development act does not 762 destroy but only supplements the land acquisition act.
