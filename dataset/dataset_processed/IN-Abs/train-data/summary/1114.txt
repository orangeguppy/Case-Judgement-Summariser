the municipal committee, akola, passed a resolution to impose an octroi tax and forwarded it along with the draft rules of assessment and collection to the state government.
the state government published a notification in the gazette which contained the articles to be taxed, the rate or rates at which they were to be taxed and a brief statement of objects and reasons for the imposition of the tax.
this was followed by draft rules as to how taxation was to be done.
thereafter the municipal committee affixed on its notice board and also published in the local newspapers the said proposed rules but the draft rules in regard to the " system of assessment " were not published along with other particulars.
it was alleged by the appellants that the municipality by not publishing the draft rules of the " system of assessment ", failed to comply in full with the mandatory requirements of section 67(2) of the act rendering the imposition of tax illegal.
held, that the words " system of assessment " did not neces sarily mean the whole procedure of taxation, i.e. imposition, collection and procedure in regard to collection and refund.
the notice and not the draft rules relating to assessment and collection were required under the rules to be affixed on the notice 619 board of the municipality and at other conspicuous places of the town.
in the instant case the publication of the rules relating to the rates at which the tax had been imposed was sufficient compliance with the provisions of section 67(2) of the c. p. s berar municipal act, 1922, and the rules made thereunder.
