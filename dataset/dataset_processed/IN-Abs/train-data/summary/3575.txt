in 1946, the appellant ordered cement manufacturing machinery from a in denmark, for its factory in dandot, but long before the machinery was due, the country was parti tioned and dandot went to pakistan.
instead of cancelling his order, the appellant imported the machinery.
it was found that the appellant did so with the intention of sell ing it at a profit, to the orissa state.
at the time of the sale, the appellant charged only the invoice price initially paid by it, but later, obtained a profit.
the income tax officer treated the profit as income earned pursuant to an adventure in the nature of trade, and taxed it as such.
the appellant 's appeals were rejected by the appellate taxation authorities.
the matter was then referred to the high court section 66 (1 ) of the income tax act, but was dismissed.
the appellant contended that making a profit was not its intention at the time of sale, and that being a single and isolated transaction of purchase and sale, it was not an adventure in the nature of trade within the meaning of section 2(4) of the act, and that the onus of proving anything to the contrary, lay upon the department.
dismissing the appeal, the court held: (i) it is well settled that even a single and isolated transaction can be held to be capable of failing within the definition of "business" if it bears clear indi cia of trade.
the fact that the transaction is not in the way of business of the assessee does not in any way alter the character of the transaction.
