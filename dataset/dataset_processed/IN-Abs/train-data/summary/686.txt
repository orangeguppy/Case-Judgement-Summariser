in exercise of the powers under section 3 of the essential com modities act, 1955, and under cl. 5 of the sugar (control) order, 1955, the government of india issued a notification dated july 30, 1958, fixing the ex factory price per maund of sugar produced in punjab, uttar pradesh and north bihar.
the petitioners challenged the legality of the notification on the grounds (1) that it was beyond the ambit of authority conferred on the central government under section 3 of the essential commodities act, 955, and clause 5 of the sugar (control) order, 1955, and that, in any case, it was bad as it could not subserve the purposes of the act ensuring equitable distribution of the commodity to the consumer at a fair price, (2) that the act and the order did not authorise the central government to fix ex factory prices, and,, in any case, the notification failed to fix prices for the ultimate consumer, (3) that it imposed an unreasonable restriction on the right to trade under article 10(1)(g), inasmuch as it fixed the price arbitrarily, and there was no reasonable safeguard against the abuse of power, and (4) that it was discriminatory because it fixed ex factory prices only for factories in punjab, uttar pradesh and north bihar and not for factories in other parts of india and there was no reasonable classification discernible on any intelligible differentia on the basis of which prices had been controlled in certain regions only.
held, (1) the notification dated july 30, 1958, is within the authority conferred on the central government by section 3 of the , and cl. 5 of the sugar (control) order,1955.
(2) section 3 of the act which provides for control of price is very general in terms and authorises the central government to fix the ex factory price of sugar without fixing the wholesale or retail prices; and, since fair prices for the consumer are ensured by fixing the ex factory price, the notification in question subserves the purposes of the act, and is valid.
(3) clause 5 of the sugar (control) order, 1955, lays down the factors which have to be taken into consideration in fixing prices, and as the prices were fixed in accordance therewith, the 124 action taken by the government in the interests of the general public could not be challenged on the ground that it was an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade under article 19(1)(g) of the constitution.
(4) though under the notification prices are fixed for fac tories only in punjab, uttar pradesh and north bihar, in effect, they are fixed for the whole of india, as the other states are deficit ; consequently, the notification brought about no discrimination between different regions.
