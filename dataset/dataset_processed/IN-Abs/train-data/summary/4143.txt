allowing the appeal by special leave, the court, ^ held.
rule 2(a) of the c.c.s. (c.c.a.) rules, 1965 states, after setting out alternative authorities, that the appointing authority is one out of four categories who is the highest, by using the expression "whichever authority is the highest".
there is no doubt that of the four classes of authorities listed under rule 2(a), the one falling under sub rule (iii) viz. comptroller & auditor general (in the present case) is the highest.
therefore the order of the retirement to be legal must be issued by the comptroller & auditor general.
the impugned order of retirement issued by the director of the commercial audit who is a lesser official is contrary to law.
on account of the contravention of f.r. 56(j) read with rule 2(a) of the c.c.s. (c.c.a.) rules, 1965, the retirement is illegal.
[555 e g, 556 b] observation: administrative law is a course necessary for administrative officers at the highest levels so that such flaws may not vitiate orders they pass.
