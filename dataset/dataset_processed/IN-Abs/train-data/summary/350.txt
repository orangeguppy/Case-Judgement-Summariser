the appellant was put up on his trial on a charge of murder.
the trial continued for 41/2 years.
his brother who was a co accused absconded.
the evidence against the appellant was circumstantial.
his confession, made 8 days after his arrest, led to certain discoveries but he was never questioned about it by the trial court under section 342 of the code of criminal procedure.
the high court excluded the confession from the evidence, upheld the conviction but altered the death sentence to one of rigorous imprisonment for life.
the supreme court took the view that the high court was right in excluding the confession from the evidence and the conviction was unsustainable on the evidence on record.
held, that in the particular facts of the case the omission to examine the accused under section 342 of the code was no more technicality and it would be unjust to the accused to remand the case for a retrial and the order of conviction and sentence passed on him must be set aside.
that while it is no doubt incumbent on the court to see that no guilty person escapes, it is still more its duty to see that justice is not delayed and accused persons indefinitely harassed.
the scales must be held even between the prosecution and the accused.
that it is imperative that magistrates and sessions judges should remember the duty that section 342 of the code of criminal procedure imposes on them of questioning the accused person fairly and properly telling him in clear and simple language the case he has to meet and the material points made against him so that he can, if he so desires, explain and meet them.
