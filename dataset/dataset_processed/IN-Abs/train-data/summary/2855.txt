on the question whether tooth powder manufactured by the assessees was "cosmetic" or a "toilet requisite" liable to tax under section 3(a) of the u.p. sales tax act, read with entry 6 of notification no. 905/x dated march 31, 1956/or whether it is an unspecified commodity liable to tax under section 3 of the act, held : tooth powder is a toilet and therefore taxable under section 3(a) of the u.p. sales tax act, read with the notification.
neither the expression 'cosmetic, nor 'toilet requisite ' has been defined under the act.
the names of articles, the sales and purchases of which are liable to be taxed given in a statute, unless defined in the statute, must be construed not in a technical sense but as understood in a common parlance.
in common parlance a tooth powder is considered as a toilet and that meaning accords with the dictionary meaning as well.
