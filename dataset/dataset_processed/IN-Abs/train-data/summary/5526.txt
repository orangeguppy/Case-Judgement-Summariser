the high court allowed the writ petition and quashed the order of the deputy director of consolidation.
the appellants filed appeal in this court against the order of the high court.
the appeal came up for hearing on may 7, 1987, when it was dismissed for default of appearance, where after an application for restoration was filed on the ground that counsel for the appellants was busy in the high court at the time of hearing of the appeal.
this court found no justification for recalling its order, dismissing the appeal, but in view of the fact that the appellants would suffer for no fault of theirs, decided to hear the matter, directing that this practice should not be permitted in this court any further.
dismissing the appeal (on merits), the court, ^ held: there is no merit in the appeal.
the high court was right in holding that the respondents (concerned) were in possession of the land in 1958 when the case started under section 145 of the cr.
p.c. and their date of occupation could not be later than 8.5.1958, so that the six years ' period of limitation for a suit for their eviction under section 209 of the zamindari abolition and land reforms act would start running from july 1, 1958 and expire on june 30, 1964 i.e. before the consolidation operations commenced.
the appellants contended that there was a break in the possession of the respondents concerned between 8.5.1958 and 29.1.60, but during that period the land was in the custody of the criminal court which must be deemed to have been holding possession of the land on behalf of the person eventually found to be entitled to possession.
the respondents had matured their title by adverse possession and there could be no warrant for denying them the status of rightful owners.
there was no break in the possession of the respondents and they must be held to have been in continuous occupation at least from may, 1958.
