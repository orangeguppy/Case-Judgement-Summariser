the appellant, a non profit making registered society, is running a school in delhi.
the municipal corporation raised a demand of general tax on the school building.
the appellant claimed exemption from the tax on the ground that the society was running the school for a charitable purpose and therefore fell within the ambit of clause (4) of section 115 of the delhi municipal corporation act, 1957.
the claim was rejected by the corporation.
the appellant 's writ petition under article 226 of the constitution was dismissed by the high court.
the high court held that mere imparting of education could not be called giving relief and to qualify for exemption the society had to give education and medical relief; and that fees were charged from students.
before this court it was contended by the appellant that in view of the language of section 115(4)(a) it was not correct to suggest that to qualify for exemption from the tax li ability it was necessary for the society to offer medical relief.
the respondent on the other hand contended that although it was not in a position to support the reasoning given by the high court, the appellant was for other reasons not entitled to the exemption 'claimed and the high court 's judgment was, therefore, correct.
allowing the appeal and remitting the case to the high court for fresh decision on the facts relied upon by the parties, this court, held: (1) a "charitable purpose" as defined in the act, includes relief of the poor, education and medical relief.
the test of 'charitable purpose ' is satisfied by the proof of any of the three conditions, 67 namely, relief of the poor, education, or medical relief.
[68e f] (2) the fact that some fee is charged from the students is also not decisive inasmuch as the proviso to section 115(4)(a) indicates that the expenditure incurred in running the society may be supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions.
