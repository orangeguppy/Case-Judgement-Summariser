the respondent rice millers obtained permits under clause (3) of the southern states (regulation of export of rice) order, 1964, for exporting "broken rice" from andhra pradesh to kerala but were intercepted for allegedly transporting "whole rice" for "broken rice".
the rice was seized, and samples analysed in the presence of the district revenue officer who ordered confiscation of the estimated quantity of the "whole rice".
on appeal, the district judge remanded the matter for giving fuller opportunity to the respondents for objecting to the sample analysis which was to be carried out afresh in their presence.
the state 's revision application against the remand order dismissed by the high court, the revenue officer then ordered a release of 12%, and the confiscation of the remaining quantity seized, as no sample from the bags contained a minimum percentage of 60% of "broken" grains satisfying the test laid down in the hand book on grading foodgrains and oilseed.
the district & sessions judge partially allowed the respondents ' appals.
both sides filed revision applications.
the high court decided in favour of the respondent, holding that "broken rice" included "whole rice".
allowing the appeals, the court, ^ held: (1) ordinarily, this court does not interfere with findings of fact.
but, where the errors of logic as well as law appear to be gross and to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice, the court is constrained to interfere.
[609 d] (2) the revenue officer 's order releasing the seized rice to the extent of about 12% having become final, it should not be interfered with except to the extent that the learned sessions judge added 2% more for foreign matter thereby releasing slightly more in favour of the respondent.
