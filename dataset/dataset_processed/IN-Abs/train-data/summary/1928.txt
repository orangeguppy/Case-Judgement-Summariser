under sections 22, 23, and 43 of the mysore university act, the academic council of the university was empowered, inter alia, to control and operate the teaching, courses of study, to secure maintenance of standards, etc., and to make necessary regulations including those relating to examinations and conditions on which students may be admitted to examinations, degrees, diplomas, etc.
in exercise of these powers, the academic council made certain regulations relating to the grant of a degree of bachelor of veterinary science and by clause 3(c of these regulations, it was provided that no candidate who failed an examination four times, would permitted to continue the course.
the respondents were declared unsuccessful in four successive first year course examinations and the controller of examinations informed each respondent that he had lost their right to continue studying for the degree.
the respondents thereupon filed petitions in the high court, praying for the issue of writs quashing the orders communicated to them and directing the university to permit them to appear for the subsequent examinations and to continue their studies.
the high court held that regulation 3(c) was beyond the competence of the academic council and the university.
on appeal to this court: held: that power to maintain standards in the course of studies confers authority not merely to prescribe minimum qualifications for admission, courses of study, minimum attendance at an institution which may qualify the student for admission to the examination, etc.,but also authority to refuse to grant a degree, diploma, or other academic distinction to students who fail at the final examination and to direct that a student, who is proved not to have the ability or the aptitude to complete the course within a reasonable time,discontinue the course.
there is no warrant for restricting the expression "maintenance of standards" only to matters such as minimum attendance, length of the course and prescription of minimum academic attainments.
