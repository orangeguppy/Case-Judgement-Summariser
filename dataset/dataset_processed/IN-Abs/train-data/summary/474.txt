section 16 of the assam land revenue regulation, 1 of 1886 defines " right of fishery " and section 155(f) empowers the provincial government to make rules for " the granting of licences, or the farming of the right. . to fish in the fisheries".
the state government accordingly framed the fishery rules and r. 12 thereof provides that no fishery shall be settled otherwise than by sale except by the state government.
it was contended that r. 12 was ultra vires the provincial government and was repugnant to section 16 of the regulation.
held, that r. 12 is not ultra vires ' and is not repugnant to section 16 of the regulation.
there is nothing in section 16 which indicates the principles or the policy on which the rules for the acquisition of fishery rights are to be framed.
the whole thing is left to the discretion of the state government.
held further, that r. 12 specifically empowers the state government to settle the fishery rights otherwise than by sale, e.g., by individual settlements.
