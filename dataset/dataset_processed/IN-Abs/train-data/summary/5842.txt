the respondents, manufacturers of refrigerators, give one year warranty for the complete refrigerator and all parts thereof.

these appeals by revenue under section 35l(b) of the act are against the tribunal 's decision.
dismissing the appeals, this court, ^ held: 1.
the contract for four years warranty service was optional which was entered into later on.
this is clearly after sale 657 facility and cannot be includible in the assessable value of the refrigerator.
[661g] 1.2 the tribunal was right in the view it took that the optional service charge after the expiry of the first year warranty period was not includible in the assessable value.
it rightly observed that if any consumer did not like to have the service, there was no compulsion on him to go in for it and once the conclusion is reached that post warranty service activity could not be subjected to excise, it ceases to be material that 91% of the customers had opted for the service contract.
the tribunal also observed that the respondents offered the four year service by a stamped endorsement on their sale invoice itself, but it did not mean that the subsequent exercise of option by the buyer related back to the date of purchase itself and that there was no evidence to conclude that the service contract was a facade to split the true value of refrigerators into taxable and non taxable components.
