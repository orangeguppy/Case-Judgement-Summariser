while quantifying the compensation , the labour court observed that the termination of services of the two workmen was bonafide and not a colourable exercise of power in accordance with the service rules and awarded one year 's wages as compensation for the failure of the employer to comply with the requirements of section 25f.

ordinarily , where the termination of service is found to be bad and illegal , in the field of industrial relations a declaration follows that the workman continues to be in service and has to be reinstated in service with full backwages.
the labour court has however , the discretion to award compensation in respect of reinstatement if the circumstances of a particular case , are unusual or exceptional so as to make reinstatement inexpedient or improper.

the labour court while declining to grant the relief of reinstatement which should have ordinarily followed , consequent upon its finding that the termination of service was bad and illegal , in exercise of its discretion awarded one year 's wages as compensation in lieu of reinstatement on the ground that 'the termination of service of each of the appellant was bonafide and not a colourable exercise of power in accordance with service rules '.

inasmuch as if termination of service was according to service rules and was bonafide it could not be simultaneously held to be illegal and invalid.
therefore.
this discretion was exercised on irrelevant and extraneous considerations or considerations not germane to the termination.

respondent employer shall assist the appellants for obtaining the relief.
