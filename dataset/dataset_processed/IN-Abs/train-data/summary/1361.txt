the official receiver put the properties of the insolvents n and his sons for sale, which were subject to mortgage.
the properties were ultimately knocked down to the appellant whose bid was the highest.
the first respondent made an application under section 68 of the which was allowed by the subordinate judge on the ground that the price fetched was very low on appeal under section 75 of the act the district judge, inter alia, held that the price fetched was not low.
in revision under the proviso to section 75 of the act, the high court did not consider whether the order of the district judge was according to law but accepted an offer made by the first respondent and allowed the revision petition.
^ held, that the power of the court under section 68 is a judicial power, and must be exercised on well recognised principles, justifying interference with an act of the receiver which he is empowered to do under section 59(a) , and the court must not arbitrarily set aside a sale decided upon by the official receiver, unless there are good judicial grounds to interfere with the discretion exercised by the official receiver, for example that there was fraud or collusion between the receiver and the insolvent or intending purchaser, or the court is of the opinion that there were irregularities in the conduct of the sale which might have affected the price fetched at the sale, or price was low as to justify the court to hold that the property should not be sold at that price.
691 the high court had therefore to see whether the sub judge 's order was justified on these grounds and whether the district judge made any mistake in law in reversing that order otherwise the high court cannot interfere in revision under the proviso to section 75 of the , for the high court 's jurisdiction to interfere arises only if it is of opinion that the district judge 's order was not according to law, and only then it can pass such order as it may think fit.
