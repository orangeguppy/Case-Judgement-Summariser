under item no.17 of the schedule to the , excise duty was levied on footwear produced in any factory employing 50 or more workmen and using power exceeding 2 h.p.
the petitioner contended that the imposition of duty on larger manufacturers only was dis criminatory and there was no reasonable basis for differentiating between manufacturers on the basis of number of workers or the employment of power above 2 h.p. and that the im. position of the heavy duty gave rise to a competition sufficient to put the big manufacturers out of business.
held, that item 17 of the schedule is based upon a reasonable classification and is validly enacted.
manufacturers who employed 50 or more workers form a well defined class, so also manufacturers who.
use power exceeding 2 h.p.
in imposing the excise duty there is a definite desire to make an exemption in favoui of the small manufacturer who is unable to pay the duty as easily, if at all, as the big manufacturer, such a classification in the interests of co operative societies cottage industries and small 'manufacturers has often the made to give an impetus to them and save them from annihilation in competition with large industry.
