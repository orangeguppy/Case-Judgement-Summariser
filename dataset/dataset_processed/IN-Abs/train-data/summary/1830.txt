while greasing the spur gear wheel of an oil mill, one of the hands of a workman got caught and had to be amputated.
it appeared that at the time of the accident the cover of the spur gear wheel was not there.
the respondent, who is the manager of the mill was prosecuted under section 92 of the for having failed to comply with section 21(1) (iv) (c) of the act.
the workman said that the cover had been removed by the respondent for repairs, while the case of the respondent was that the workman had himself removed it.
the trial judge was unable to accept either version and he acquitted the respondent observing that he could not be held liable if the cover was removed by someone, without his consent or knowledge.
on appeal, the high court affirmed the acquittal.
held: (i) the mere fact that someone else had removed the safeguard without the knowledge, consent or connivance of the occupier or manager does not provide a defence to him.
when the statute says that it will be his duty to keep a guard in position while the machine is working and when it appears that he has not done so, it will be for him to establish that notwithstanding this he was not liable.
(ii) even where the occupier or manager could establish that somebody else had removed the fence, he has further to prove that he exercised due diligence to see that the fence, which under the act was his duty to see was kept in position all along, had not been removed.
