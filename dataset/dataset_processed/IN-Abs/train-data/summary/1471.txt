the appellants, the nearer sapindas of the husband of the 2nd respondent who had adopted the 1st respondent, the son of her agent, filed a suit for a declaration that the adoption was invalid on the ground that they had properly refused their consent and that the remote sapinda who had given his consent was disqualified from so doing as he did not believe in the hindu scriptures.
the appellants who had been asked for their consent had refused it on the ground that the 1st respondent was not an agnate and that among their grand children or children there were eligible boys whom their parents were willing to give in adoption.
the trial court at madurai as well as the high court of madras dismissed the suit, holding that the nearer sapindas had improperly refused their consent and that in the circumstances the adoption with the content of the remote sapinda was valid.
on appeal by a certificate under article 133 (1)(c).

the sapindas who are in a fiduciary relation to the widow should exercise their power objectively and without being actuated by their own self interest and that the rules regarding taking only a sapinda in adoption were only recommendatory and the fact that the widow wishes to adopt a non sapinda is no proper ground for withholding consent by a sapindas.
