the respondent was a sub inspector of police and had served as such in various places which are now in pakistan before being posted to gurgaon in 1948.
his confidential 'service reports upto 1940 were satisfactory.
in 1941 and 1942 he got bad reports.
however he was allowed to cross the efficiency bar in 1944.
the reports relating to 1945 and 1946 were again adverse.
in 1948 the report charged him with having taken bribe in a particular case, but the charge was on enquiry found to be false.
on october 12, 1949 he was served with a charge sheet setting forth extracts from his confidential character roll imputing inefficiency and lack of probity while in service from 1941 to 1948.
he was asked to answer to the prima facie charge of inefficiency as envisaged in paragraph 16.25(2) of the punjab police rules.
a departmental enquiry was held and the enquiry officer in 1950 recommended his dismissal.
after a further show cause notice the respondent was dismissed from service.
he thereupon filed a suit in which he challenged his dismissal as wrongful on the grounds inter alia that (i) reports relating to the years 1941 & 1942 should not have been taken into consideration against him; (ii) that the enquiry officer did not allow him to examine in defence the officers who had written adverse reports against him and other witnesses who could have thrown light on these reports.
the trial court decreed the suit and the high court also held in the appellant 's favour mainly on the ground that article 311 of the constitution had not been complied with.
in appeal to this court by the state of punjab.
held : (i) reports earlier than 1944 should not have been considered at all inasmuch as the respondent was allowed to cross the efficiency bar in that year.
it was unthinkable that if the authorities took any serious view of the charge of dishonesty and inefficiency contained in the confidential reports for 1941 and 1942 they could have overlooked the same and recommended the case of the officer as one fit for crossing the efficiency bar in 1944.
moreover there was no specific complaint in either of the two years and at best there was only room for suspicion re garding his behaviour.
[699 h] (ii) on the facts of this case it was impossible to hold that the respondent had been given reasonable opportunity of conducting his defence before the enquiry officer.
it was clear that if the enquiry officer had summoned at least those witnesses who were available and who could have thrown some light on the reports made against the, respondent the report might will have been different.
refusal of the right to examine witnesses who had made general rem arks against the respondent 's character and were available for examination at the enquiry amounted to denial of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed.
although the case was governed by article 311 as it stood prior to its 695 amendment in 1963 the respondent could not be deprived of an effective right to make representation against the action of dismissal.
[701 f g; 703 c d] in this view the appeal by the state of punjab must fail.
