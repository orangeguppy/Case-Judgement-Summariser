the appellants, were alleged to have entered the house of one with the common intention of killing him.
one of the appellants injured e with a dagger while the other three held him.
e 's injury did not prove fatal.
the sessions judge convicted them under sections 449 and 307 with section 34 of the indian penal code.
which on appeal was upheld by the high court.
on appeal by certificate, it was contended that there can 979 be no conviction under section 449 of the indian penal code unless murder had actually been committed; and that a charge under section 307 read with section 34 of the indian penal code was not sustainable in law.
held: there was no substance in either of these contentions.
an act can be said to be committed "in order to the committing of an offence" even though the offence may not be completed.
the words "in order to" have been used in section 449 i.p.c. to mean "with the purpose of '.
whether or not the purpose was actually accomplished is quite irrelevant.
once it is decided that the act is so done by a number of persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, the legal position that results is each person shall be held to have committed the entire criminal act.
