in respect of an occurrence which took place on 8th march, 1974, at a place in the district of cuttack, a police investigation commenced in connection with the offences alleged to have been committed under sections 147, 148, 307, 302 simpliciter as also with the aid of section 149 of the indian penal code.
of the eight persons arrested during investigation, four have been enlarged on bail by the sessions judge of cuttack, but the learned sessions judge refused to grant bail to the four appellants.
their conten tion based on proviso (a) to sub section (2) of section 167 of the code of criminal procedure, 1973, was rejected by the learned judge relying on the saving clause (a) of sub section (2) of section 484.
the high court also rejected their contention.
this appeal has been filed on the basis of the special leave granted by the supreme court.
held : (i) a magistrate having jurisdiction to try a case could remand an accused to jail custody from time to time during the pendency of the investigation in exercise of the power under section 344 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898.
in other words, the power of remand by the magistrate during the process of investigation and collection of evidence was an integral part of the process.
the power was meant to be exercised whenever necessary to aid the investigation and collection of further evidence.

(ii)courts will have no inherent power of remand of an accused to any custody unless the power is conferred by law.
the high court has crred in assuming, without reference to section 344 of the old code, that such a power existed.
[140d] (iii)the command of the legislature in proviso(a) to section 167(2) of the new code is that the accused person has got to be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail and cannot be kept in detention beyond the period of 60 days even if the investigation may still be proceeding.
although the expression 'reasonable cause ' occurring in sub section (1a) of section 344 is no where to be found in section 309 of the new code, the explanation to section 344 of the old code has been retained as explanation 1 to section 309 in the identical language.
the law as engrafted in 138 proviso (a) to section 167(2) and section 309(2) of the new code confers the powersof remand to jail custody during the pendency of the investigation only tinderthe former and not under the latter.
section 309(2) is attracted only aftercognizance of an offence has been taken or commencement of trial has proceeded.
[142g h] quere : what is the purpose of explanation 1 in section 309 of the code of criminal procedure, 1973.
(iv)unlike the wordings of section 428 the language of section 167(1) which will govern sub section (2) also, is "whenever any person is arrested", suggesting thereby that the section would be attracted when the arrest is made after coming into force of the act of 1973.
the expression used in section 428 is "where an accused person has, on conviction been sentenced. . ".
to the facts of the present case, clause (a) of subsection (2) of section 484 will apply.
immediately before the 1st day of april, 1974 the investigation of this case was pending.
saving clause (a) therefore, enjoins that the said investigation shall be continued or made in accordance with chapter xiv of the old code.
section 167 of that code could not enable the magistrate to remand the appellants to jail custody during the pendency of the investigation.
the police could seek the help of the court for exercise of its power of remand under section 344, bringing it to the notice of the court that sufficient evidence had been obtained to raise a suspicion that the appellants may have committed an offence and there will be hindrance to the obtaining of further evidence unless an order of remand was made.
