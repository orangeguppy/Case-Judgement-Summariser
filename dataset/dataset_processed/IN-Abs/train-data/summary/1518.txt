it was contended by the appellants, that it was open to them to have the sale set aside in the civil court on the ground that the arrear for which the property was sold was not due.
the trial court dismissed the suit on the ground that the suit did not lie and the high court affirmed the decision.
held, that section 149 (2) of the act was plain and unambiguous and that if the arrear in respect of which the sale was held was not due it gave a right to the owner of the property to have the sale set aside in a civil court.
the fact that subsequent to the sale proclamation but on the date of the sale further amounts towards land revenue had become due was not material, the scheme of the act being that in respect of each specific arrear separate proceedings had to be taken.
held, further, that mistakes and irregularities contemplated by the act which would not furnish grounds for invalidating and setting aside the sale were of a different kind and from the scheme of the act it is clear that a sale for an arrear that was not due was put in a separate category.
