in order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessary to develop the cane area, the ruler of the erstwhile gwalior state by an order dated 27 7 1946 sanctioned the levy of cess of one anna per maund on all sugar cane purchased by the respondent company.
when the government of madhya bharat, which was the successor state of the former gwalior state, made a demand for payment of the cess, the respondent filed a petition before the high court of madhya bharat challenging the legality of the levy on the grounds (1) that the order dated 27 7 1946 was only an executive order and not a law under article 265 of the constitution of india and that, therefore, there was no authority for the imposition of the cess after january 26, 1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and violated article 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable to pay the cess the other sugar factories in the state were exempt.
it was found that at the time when cess was first levied there was no sugar factory in existence in the gwalior state other than that of the respondent.
held, that (i) the ruler of an indian state was an absolute monarch in which there was no constitutional limitation to act in any manner be liked, he being the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive.
, consequently, the order dated 27 7 1946 issued by the ruler of gwalior state amounted to a law enacted by him and became an existing law under article 372 of the constitution of india.
the levy of cess was therefore by authority of law within the meaning of article 265; madhaorao phalke vs the state of madhya bharat, ; , followed.
(2) the levy of cess did not contravene article 14 because (a) the object was cane development in the particular area and a geographical classification based upon historical factors was a permissible mode of classification, and (b) a tax could not be struck down as discriminatory unless it was found that it was imposed with a deliberate intention of differentiating between 620 an individual and individual; and particularly, in the instant case, where when cess was first sought to be levied, there was no other sugar factory existing in the state.
