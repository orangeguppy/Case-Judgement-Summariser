held, that the government of bombay was entitled, under clause (a) of sub section (4) of section 6 of the bombay land requisition act, 1948 (bombay act xxxiii of 1948) to requisition as for a public purpose, certain premises for 'housing a member of the staff of a foreign consulate '.
the purpose for which the requisition was made was a "public purpose" within the meaning of the act; and the requisition was made in this case more as a state purpose than as a union purpose.
in any event "other public purpose", is a category distinct from "union purpose" and "state purpose" and the acquisition or requisitioning of property by the state except for the purpose of the union, is within its competence under item 36 of the state list.
an undertaking may have three different facets or aspects and may serve the purpose of a state, the purpose of the union and a general public purpose.
even if one may regard the requisition of a room for the accommodation of a member of a consulate as one appertaining to a union purpose, it does not necessarily cease to be a state purpose or a general public purpose.
therefore on this view also, the requisition in the present case must be held to have been validly made.
courts should lean against a construction which would render words in a statute mere surplusage.
