the petitioners were railway employees.
the railway board issued a circular dated july 2, 1970, laying down procedure for filling up posts of train examiners and upgra dation of posts.
it directed that vacancies arising in grade c after 1.4.1966 to the extent of 50 per cent would be maintained in that grade and the remaining 50 per cent would be down graded to be filled by promotion of skilled arti sans.
it further directed that 50 per cent of the vacancies in grade c should be filled by direct recruitment of appren tice train examiners with five years ' training to the extent of 80 per cent thereof and the remaining 20 per cent by promotees from grade d as laid down in paragraph 1 of the circular dated 27.10.1965 of the board.
this procedure was directed to be followed till the cadre position was norma lised and the excess in the grade of rs.205 280 were elimi nated.
paragraph 2 of the circular further directed that those promoted to grade c in the scale of rs.205280 as on april 1, 1966 would be assigned seniority amongst themselves in the order of their inter se seniority in the grade of rs. 180 240 for the purposes of confirmation, etc., in that grade and they would rank senior to those recruited as apprentice train examiners with five years ' training and appointed after 1.4.66 in the grade of rs.205 280.
the result of the circular was that all those promotees, who had been appointed to grade d prior to 1.4.66 stood absorbed in grade c and they were granted seniority in that grade with retrospective effect, that is, with effect from april 1, 1966.
the railway board later took a policy decision to abol ish the entry grade d of train examiners in the pay scale of rs. 180 240, and in order to implement that decision issued a circular dated october 30, 1972, abolishing the entry grade d of the train examiners and placing the incumbents of that grade en masse in grade c in the scale of rs.205280 with effect from 1.11.72.
paragraph 2 of the circular di rected that the pay of the staff brought from grade d (rs.180 240) to grade c 1019 (rs.205 280) would be fixed under rule 2017 a (iii) read with rule 2019 ii.
as all the incumbents of grade d in the scale of rs. 180 240 were placed en masse in the higher grade c in the scale of rs.205 280, a provisional seniority list of grade c train examiners working in delhi division was prepared on november 16, 1981.
in that seniority list, the petitioners were shown senior to some of the respondents as the seniority was not determined in accordance with rule 302 of the railway establishment manual.
this seniority list was not prepared in accordance with the prescribed criteria, as had been done in the other divisions.
the board issued a circular dated 28.11.81, directing that the delhi division should also fail in line with the other divisions of the northern railway, and the seniority of the train examiners appointed between 1.4.66 and 1.11.72 should be prepared in accordance with the existing practice.
viz. on the basis of the date of appointment in the particular grade.
in pursuance of that direction, seniority of the train examiners of grade c placed in that grade between 1.4.66 and 1.11.72, was published in 1981 by the authorities of the delhi division of the northern railway.
after inviting objections, the seniority list was finally published in december, 1982.
in that seniority list, the petitioners were shown junior to respondents 5 to 10.
aggrieved, the peti tioners moved this court by writ petitions, challenging the validity of the seniority list and for quashing the circu lars dated july 2, 1970 and november 28, 1981 of the railway board, and restraining the respondent railway authorities from altering or issuing the seniority list in pursuance of the circular dated november 28, 1981 of the railway board and for maintaining the seniority list issued in 1968.
dismissing the petitions, the court, held: the respondents nos.
5 to 10, who belonged to the group of apprentice train examiners were directly placed to working posts in grade c after completion of 5 years ' train ing in accordance with the circular dated july 2, 1970 of the railway board, and each one of them had been placed in grade c prior to 1.11.72, while the petitioners were placed in grade c with effect from 1.11.72, in pursuance of the circular dated 30.10.72 of the railway board.
since the respondents 5 to 10 were appointed to grade c earlier and the petitioners were placed in that grade later, the peti tioners were shown in the seniority list junior to the respondents concerned.
no valid objection can be raised against respondents ' seniority.
[1027h; 1028a c] 1020 the petitioners challenged the validity of the railway board 's circular dated july 12, 1970, in 1981 after 11 years.
all the petitioners were in service on the date that circular was issued and they were aware that their col leagues (promotees belonging to grade d) were placed in grade c and they had been granted seniority with retrospec tive effect, but none of them challenged the validity of the circular.
now, the petitioners cannot be permitted to chal lenge the validity of that circular after 11 years.
the petitioners should have challenged the circular within a reasonable period of time which they did not do.
it is wellsettled that anyone, who may feel aggrieved by an admin istrative order or decision affecting his right, should act with due diligence and promptitude and not sleep over the matter.
taking up old matters after a long time is likely to result in administrative complications and difficulties and would create insecurity and instability in the service which would affect its efficiency.
the petitioners are, therefore, not entitled to challenge the validity of the railway board 's circular dated july 2, 1970, after 11 years.
even otherwise, on merits.
there is no legal and constitutional infirmity in the circular.
in order to reorganise the cadre of the train examiners to cope with the increased work load, the railway board issued a notification dated october 27, 1965, reorganising the cadre.
the validity of the notifica tion was challenged before this court in roshan lal tandon 's case.
the court struck down only a portion of the notifica tion and the rest of the directions contained in the notifi cation remained unaffected.
after the judgment of the court, the railway board reconsidered the matter, and, with a view to implementing the decision of this court and further carrying out its policy of reorganisation as initiated under its circular dated october 27, 1965, issued the circular dated july 2, 1970 [1029a h; 1030a b] the scheme of reorganisation of the cadre as contemplat ed by the circular dated october 27, 1965, was to be opera tive with effect from april 1, 1966.
the petitioners ' sub mission that the date april 1, 1966, was fixed in an arbi trary manner without any basis, is untenable.
the promotees, who were placed in the higher grade c with effect from april 1, 1966, were undoubtedly senior to the petitioners in grade d, and none of the petitioners ' rights were affected by their promotions.
the railway board implemented the reorgan isation scheme after the decision of this court in roshan lal tandon 's case.
as promotion to grade c had been stayed during the pendency of tandon 's case in this court, the railway board was justified in granting promotion with retrospective effect from april 1, 1966, as initially, the reorganisation was proposed to be implemented from that date, which could not be done on account of stay orders issued by this court.
the petitioners 1021 cannot claim parity with those who had been promoted to grade c under the railway board 's circular dated july 2, 1970, as they do not belong to that class.
equality can be claimed amongst equals and not with unequals.
the persons, who had acquired the right of promotion under the railway board 's notification dated october 27, 1965, but could not be promoted on account of litigation, formed a separate class, and the petitioners could not equate themselves with them, as they were not entitled to promotion under the notification dated october 27, 1965.
there is no merit in the petitioners ' plea of discrimination.
[103af h] the validity of the railway board 's circular dated july 2, 1970, was challenged by a writ petition before the delhi high court, which upheld the same.
again, the validity of that circular as well as the circular dated january 28, 1981 of the railway board was challenged by a writ petition before the delhi high court, which upheld the same.
[1032f h] by the circular dated october 30, 1972, of the railway board, the entry grade of train examiners in the scale of rs. 180 240, was abolished and all the train examiners in that grade were placed in the scale of rs.205 280 with effect from november 1, 1972.
the petitioners were included in grade c with effect from november 1, 1972, and, there fore, they are entitled to seniority with effect from that date in grade c.
the petitioners are not entitled to claim seniority in grade c with reference to the date of their appointment in grade d. the respondents 5 to 10 were ap pointed in grade c earlier than the petitioners and, there fore, they are senior to the petitioners.
rule 302 of the railway establishment manual lays down a general rule for determining seniority from the date of appointment in a particular grade when a person is promoted to or placed in a higher grade, his seniority is determined with reference to the date of such promotion or placement unless the relevant rules provide to the contrary.
seniority in lower grade has no meaning for determining seniority in the higher grade except for determining inter se seniority of the promotees.
in the absence of any contrary provision in the rules, the general rule of seniority laid down by rule 302 must pre vail.
[1034g h; 1035a e] it appears that in the seniority list prepared in 1968, the names of some of the respondents were shown in grade d on a wrong assumption.
the respondents 5 to 10 were appren tices undergoing training, and in accordance with the direc tions contained in the railway board 's notification dated october 27, 1965.
they were entitled to appointment 1022 straightaway on completion of their training.
they were drawing stipend at a rate which was the scale prescribed for grade d, but they did not belong to grade d and could not be included in the seniority list of grade d.
the petitioners cannot draw advantage from the mistake committed in includ ing the names of the respondents in the seniority list of 1968.
[1035f h; 1036a] the petitioners were placed in higher grade c with effect from november 1, 1972, and they are entitled to seniority with reference to their placement in that grade and they have no legal right to claim seniority in that grade as against those who were appointed to that grade before november 1, 1972.
[1036c d] whether the petitioners were promoted to grade c or were placed en masse in that grade, does not make any difference in so far their entry to grade c is concerned; in either case, they entered grade c with effect from november 1, 1972.
the petitioners have failed to show that any person junior to them has been made senior to them.
their grievance is without any substance.
