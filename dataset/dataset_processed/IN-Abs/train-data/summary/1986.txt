the assessee firm claimed registration under section 26a of the indian income tax act on the strength of a partnership deed executed between four partners of which two were minors.
the income tax officer refused registration on the ground that the minors were made parties to a contract by the eldest brother acting on their behalf and the minor had actually been debited with a share of loss.
this was upheld by the appellate assistant commissioner, but the appellate tribunal, on a further appeal.
construed the deed as having admitted the minors only to the benefits of the partnership, and accordingly held that the assessee was entitled to be registered.
in reference, the high court answered the question in favour of the assessee.
in appeal by certificate to this court, the revenue contended that (i) a guardian is not entitled to contract on behalf of a minor and the deed was consequently void, and (ii) the partnership deed made the minors as full partners.
held: the assessee firm was entitled to be registered under the income tax act.
[776 h] (i) as long as a partnership deed does not make a minor full partner a partnership deed cannot be regarded as invalid on the ground that a guardian has purported to contract on behalf of a minor.
a guardian can do all that is necessary to effect the conferment and receipt of the benefits of partnership.
so he must have the power to scrutinse the terms on which such benefits are received by the minor.
he must also have the power to accept the conditions on which the benefits of partnership are being conferred.
[775 g h] (ii) the partnership deed reasonably construed.
only conferred benefits of partnership on the two minors and did not make them full partners.
