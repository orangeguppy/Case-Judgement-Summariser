the appellant was tried under section 409, i.p.c., for having committed criminal breach of trust during the period between january 31, 1960 and november 30, 1960 while acting as a cashier.
he was put up for trial in a previous case under section 409, i.p.c., for having committed criminal breach of trust during the period december 8, 1960 to august 17, 1961 and in that case he was acquitted because it was held that he was not in charge of the cash.
on the question, whether on the principle of issue estoppel he should be acquitted, because, if he was not a cashier from december 8, 1960 to august 17, 1961 he could not be held to be a cashier from january 31, 1960 to november 30, 1960.
held : the basic principle underlying the rule of issue estoppel is that the same issue of fact and law must have been determined in the previous proceeding, that is, the latter finding must necessarily be in contradiction of the previous determination.
in the present case, however, the accused was never appointed as a cashier, but was a temporary senior accounts clerk who was alleged to be doing the work of a cashier.
a person may be acting as a cashier at one period and may not be acting as a cashier at another.
in such circumstances, when the periods are different, there can be no such contradiction.
therefore, the rule of issue estoppel does not apply to the facts of the case.
