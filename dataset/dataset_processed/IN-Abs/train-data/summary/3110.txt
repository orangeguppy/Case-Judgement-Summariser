according to the general principles set out in sections 23 and 24 of the land acquision act, 1894, for determining compensation, the compensation payable to the owner of the land is the market value which is determined by reference to the price which a seller might reasonable expect to obtain from a willing purchaser; but since it may not be possible to ascertain this with any amount of precision the authority charged with the duty to award compensation is bound to make an estimate judged by an objective standard.
the land acquired, has, therefore, to be valued not only with reference to its condition at the time of the declaration under section 4 of the act, but its potential value also must be taken into account.
this court has laid down the methods of valuation to be adopted in ascertaining the market value of the land on the date of the notification under section 4, which are : (i) opinion of experts (ii) the price paid within a reasonable time in bona fide transactions of the purchase of the lands acquired or the lands adjacent to the lands acquired and possessing similar advantages and (iii) a number of years purchase of the actual or immediately prospective profits of the lands acquired.
these methods, however, do not preclude the court from taking any other special circumstance into consideration, the requirement being always to arrive as near as possible an estimate of the market value.
in arriving at a reasonable correct market value it may be necessary to take even two or all these methods into account in as much as the exact valuation is not always possible as no two lands may be same either in respect of the situation or the extent or the potentiality, nor is it possible in all cases to have reliable material from which that valuation can be accurately determined.
