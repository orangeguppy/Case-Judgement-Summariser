dismissing the appeal of the court, ^ held: (1) the power to order police investigation under , 156(3) different from the power to direct investigation conferred by section '202(1). 'the.` two operate in distinct spheres at different stages.
the first is exercisable at the re cognizance stage, the second at the post cognizance stage when the magistrate is in seisin of the case.
an investigation under section 202 is "for the purpose or deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding".
its not to initiate a fresh case on police report, but to assist the magistrate in completing proceedings already instituted upon a complaint before him.
the stage at which section 202 could become operative was never reached in this case.
[530 h; 531b] (2) when on receiving a complaint, the magistrate applies his mind for the purposes of proceeding under section 200 and the succeeding sections in chapter xv of the code of 1973 he is said to have taken cognizance of the offence within the meaning of section 190(l)(a).

he has in the exercise of his discretion, taken action of some other kind, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of any offence.
