at the time of passing of the madras estates (abolition and conversion into ryotwari) act (madras act xxvi of 1948), a 15/16th portion of village karuppur situated within the zamindari of ramanathapuram was hold by the inamdars under a pre settlement grant confirmed by the british government, the estate being permanently settled in 1802.
the remaining one sixteenth portion was held by the holders of darmila or post settlement inams made by the proprietor of the estate.
in exercise of the powers conferred by section 1(4) of the madras act xxvi of 1948 the state of madras issued a notification dated 22nd august 1949 bringing the act into force as regards the ramanathapuram estate from 7th september 1949, the latter zamindari including one sixteenth part of haruppur village.
the respondent the holder of the one sixteenth inam contended that under section 1(3) of the madras act xxvi of 1948 the state of madras bad power to notify only what would be estates as defined in section 3(2) of the madras estates land act i of 1908 and that one sixteenth part of the village of karuppur included in the notification was not an estate as defined in that section and the notification was therefore ultra vires.
held (repelling the contention) that when the darmila inam does not relate to the entire village but only to a fraction of it, it must be held to retain its character as part of the estate in the hands of the inamdar and when the estate is notified under section 1(4) of the madras act xxvi of 1948 the inam will vest in the state under section 3(b) of the madras act xxvi of 1948 and therefore one sixteenth portion of the village of karuppur forming a darmila inam will vest in the state.
under the provisions of the madras act xxvi of 1948 the darmila minor inamdar is entitled to claim compensation for the transfer of his portion of the estate to the government.
115 908 darmila minor inam is not protected by section 20 of the act.
