held, that section 5(4) and proviso to section 3 of the prevention of corruption act, 1947 (ii of 1947) and the corresponding section 5 a of the prevention of corruption (second amendment) act, 1952 (lix of 1952) are mandatory and not directory and that an investigation conducted in violation thereof is illegal.
if cognizance is in fact taken on a police report in breach of a mandatory provision relating to investigation, the results which follow cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice.
it is well settled that an illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and the jurisdiction of the court for trial and where cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the preceding investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby when any breach of the mandatory provisions relating to investigation is brought to the notice of the court at an early stage of the trial the court will have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders for such reinvestigation as may be called for, wholly or partly, and by such officer as it considers appropriate with reference to the requirements of section 5 a of the prevention of corruption (second amendment) act, 1952.
