two brothers entered into an agreement to sell their interest in an ice factory situated at rawalpindi and received the advance money.
as the vendee failed to complete the transaction, a suit was filed by the brothers for specific performance of the agreement and for recovery of the balance consideration.
the vendee remained exparate.
a decree was passed by the sub judge for the balance of the consideration money and the vendee was given liberty to apply to the court to get a regular sale deed.
during the pendency or this suit the interest of one of the brothers was assigned in favour of the appellant who was impleaded in the suit.
the vendee left india and was declared an evacuee.
a receiver was appointed for the properties of the vendee some of which were attached on october 9, 1947 and put to sale in execution, but at the instance of the auction purchaser who became apprehensive on account of the judgment debtor being an evacuee, the sale was got set aside on july 10 1948.
on july 17,1944 an application was filed by the custodian of evacuee property under the fast punjab evacuees ' (administration of property) act 1947 claiming that the attached properties were evacuee properties and under section 8 were exempt from attachment.
this application was dismissed on july 19, 1948 on the ground that a receiver was appointed by the court who was in possession of the properties, and no step was taken by the custodian under s.6.
332 the attached properties were again brought to sale and on this occasion the appellant purchased the properties and the sale was confirmed on october 16, 1948.
the east punjab act having been amended in 1948, another application was made by the custodian under the amended section 8(2) of the act on december 11, 1948.
this application was rejected on the ground that the said provision was not applicable to court sales of property attached prior to december 31, 1947.
the administration of evacuee property (chief commissioners provinces) ordinance, 1949 was promulgated on july 10, 1949.
the custodian made an application under section 15, on august 24, 194 for setting aside the sale but this was dismissed for default on december 10, 1949.
however, during the pendency of this application another ordinance the administration of evacuee property ordinance 1949 (ordinance no. xxvii of 1949) was promulgated with effect from october 18, 1949.
the custodian made an application on december 12, 1949 both under order 9, rule 9 of the code of civil procedure 1908 and under s.17(2) of ordinance no, xxvii or 1949 for restoration of the application dismissed for default on december 10, 1949, and for setting aside the sale.
the sub court restored the application on february 11, 1950 but after hearing the application on february 28, 1950 dismissed the same on march 24, 1950.
the custodian filed an appeal before the high court against the order of the sub judge, dated march 24, 1950.
contending that the sub judge had erred in not considering the effect of section 17 of ordinance xxvii of 1949, but the appeal was dismissed, on the ground that as the earlier order dated march 28, 1949 passed by the sub judge on the basis of the east punjab act had ib became final, it was not open to the custodian to reagitate the matter again after the promulgation of ordinance no. xxvii of 1949, the custodian filed a letters patent appeal which was allowed by a division bench on december 30, 1963, on the ground that by virtue of section 17 of ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 the sale in favour of the decree holder/auction purchaser was liable to be set aside on the application made by the custodian and the application made by the custodian was not barred by the rule of res judicata.
the court sale, under which one of the decree holders had purchased the properties, was accordingly set aside.
dismissing the appeal of the auction purchaser.
^ held: 1.
ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 was replaced by the central act i.e. with effect from april 17, 1950.
section 17 of the central act was substituted with retrospective effect by administration of evacuee property (amendment) act, 1951.
the only noticeable difference between section 17 of the central act is that the date august 14, 1947 ' in section 17(2) of ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 is substituted by 'march 1, 1947 '.
in other respects, there is no material difference between the provision.
in order to decide the question whether a subsequent proceeding is barred by res judicate it is necessary to examine the question with reference to the (i) forum or the competence of the court, (ii) parties and their representatives, (iii) matters in issue, (iv) matters which ought to have been made ground for defence or attack in the former suit and (v) the final decision.
[341 d] in the instant case, there is no dispute that the parties and the properties involved in the proceedings in which the order dated march 28, 1949 was passed and in the proceedings commenced by the application which has given rise to this appeal are the same.
the only point of difference; is that whereas in the former proceedings, the custodian had relied upon the provisions of section 8 of the least punjab act, in the present proceedings, reliance is placed on the provisions of section 17(2) of (ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 and section 17(2) of the central act .
[341 e f] 3.
(i) the sub judge had not referred to ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 at all in his order.
sub section (2) of section 17 of ordinance no. xxvii of 1949 was wider in scope and content than section 8 east punjab act.
a comparison of the two would show that whereas s 8(2) of the east punjab act affected sales of the properties by court which had been attached after december 31, 1947 section 17(2) of ordinance no. xxv11 of ]949 affected any transfer of evacuee property under orders of a court or any other authority made after the 14th day of august 1947.
[342 c; d f] 3.
(ii) in the present case the properties in question had been attached by the court on october 9, 1947 which was a date anterior to december 31, 1s47 which was the crucial date for purposes of section 8(2) of the least punjab act but subsequent to august 14, 1947 which was the crucial date for purposes of section 17(2) of ordinance no. xxvii of 1949.
it was not, therefore, open to the custodian to contend in his application which was disposed of by the order dated march 28, 1949 that the court sale was liable to be set aside.
the cause of action for making that claim arose only after ordinance no. xxvii of 1945 was passed.
[342g h] 4.
a cause of action for a proceeding has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up, nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for the plaintiff or the applicant.
it refers entirely to the grounds set forth in the plaint or the application as the case may be as the cause of action or in other words to the media upon which the plaintiff or the applicant asks the court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.
[343 a b] 5.
in order that a defence of res judicata may succeed it is necessary to show that not only the cause of action was the same but also that the plaintiff had an opportunity of getting the relief which he is now seeking in the former proceedings.
the test is whether the claim in the subsequent suit or proceedings is in fact founded upon the same cause of action which was the foundation of the former suit or proceedings.
in the instant case, but for the new law contained in section 17(2) of a ordinance no. xxvli of 1949 the custodian would not have been able to question the court sale.
it therefore cannot be said that the present proceedings are barred by the rule of res judicata, even though in both the proceedings the prayer made by the custodian was that the sale of the properties in question should be set aside.
