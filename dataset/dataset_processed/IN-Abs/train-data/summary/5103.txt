the appeals raise the question whether in a case where the land acquisition officer takes temporary occupation, the person interested in the land was entitled to solatium on the compensation decreed in a proceeding under s.35 of the land acquisition act.
the high court refused to allow it.
dismissing the appeals, the court ^ held: 1.
the provisions of section 23(2) of the land acquisition act providing for payment of statutory solatium are not attracted to a case of compensation under section 35 of that act.
[470h] 2.
temporary occupation of land, provided in part vl of the act, is distinct from, and is not included in, acquisition of land under part ii of the act because in acquisition in exercise of the right of eminent domain title of the owner is extinguished and the property vests in the state, whereas when temporary occupation is taken the title of the owner remains untouched.

216 referred to.
clause "secondly" in section 23(1) of the act is not applicable to temporary occupation covered by section 35 of the act.
statutory solatium as provided in section 23(2) of the act does not apply to a case of damage covered by clause "secondly" in section 23(1) itself.
"market value" occurs in the first clause of section 23(l) of the act and sub section
(2) of section 23 refers to market value.
solatium has reference to market value and the 469 mandate to pay solatium is only in respect of market value.
compensation under section 35 of the act has no reference to market value and the actual loss sustained by the persons interested in the land only is intended to be compensated.[470f h]
