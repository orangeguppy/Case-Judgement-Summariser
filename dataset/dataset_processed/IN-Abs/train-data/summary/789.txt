an unmarried sunni muslim mother of an illegitimate female child made an application under section 49i of the code of criminal procedure for the recovery of the child from the respondents.
held, that under the mohammedan law the mother of an illegitimate female infant child is entitled to its custody.
the refusal to restore such a child to the custody of its mother would result in an illegal detention of the child within the meaning of section 49i of the criminal procedure code.
a dispute as to the paternity of the child is irrelevant for the purpose of the application.
the supreme court will interfere with the discretionary powers of the high court if the discretion was not judicially exercised.
held, also, that before making the order for the custody of the child the court is called upon to consider its welfare.
held, further, that the fact that a person has a remedy under the guardian and wards act, is no justification for denying him the remedy under section 49i of the criminal procedure code.
held, further, that in issuing writs of habeas corpus the courts have power in the case of an infant to direct its custody to be placed with a certain person.
