dismissing the appeal the court, held: 1.
the high court has rightly maintained the decree by coming to the conclusion that the amount of com mission earned by the assesseecompany was admittedly with the appellant.
it was withheld by the appellant under the pretext that it had a counter claim against the assessee under section 46(2) of the income tax act, a prohibitory order attaching the said money of the assessee company was issued and the machinery under s.46(5a) of the act was no longer effective as the appellant set up a counter claim against the assessee and there was no option for the union of india but to obtain adjudication from the civil court.

no money decree could be passed against the appel lant company except for the money lying in the deposits with them for the assessee company and it is for that pur pose that the decree for appointment of receiver was made so that the amount be recovered and paid to the plaintiff union of india.
