the appellant was a sub tenant of s on a monthly basis commencing from april 1, 1954.
s was the tenant of the respondent from september 15, 1943 on a monthly rental.
on june 16, 1955, the respondent obtained a decree of ejectment against section in view of sub s(2) of section 13 of the west bengal premises rent control (temporary provisions) act, 1950, the appellant became the tenant of the respondent after the determination of the tenancy of section the respondant gave a notice to the appellant asking him to deliver possession of the premises on the expiry of the last day of april 122 1957, since he being a statutory tenant had not paid rent since june 16, 1955.
the respondant instituted a suit for ejectment, which was decreed, and an appeal to the high court by the appellant was unsuccessful.
on appeal by special leave, it was contended that the notice was invalid for under the law the notice must be to require the appellant to deliver possession on the expiry of the month of tenancy, that the tenancy was from the 16th of a month as the decree for ejectment against s was passed on june 16, 1955 and that this notice required the delivery of possession on the expiry of the last day of april.
held: the contention was untenable and rightly rejected by the high court.
the provisions of sub section
(2) of section 13 of the west bengal rent control (temporary provisions) act, 1950 only lay down that the sub tenant would become the tenant of the landlord if the tenancy in chief is determined, on the same terms and conditions on which the sub lessee would have held under the tenant if the tenancy of the tenant had not been determined.
this means that the terms and conditions of the tenancy between the erstwhile sub tenant and the landlord continue to be the same which were the terms and conditions of the sub tenancy.
the period of monthly tenancy commencing from the first of the month and expiring on the last day of the month, was in no way affected by the provisions of sub section
(2) of section (13) whose effect was simply that the sub tenant instead of being sub tenant of the tenant who had been ejected, got a direct connection with the landlord and became his tenant in chief.
