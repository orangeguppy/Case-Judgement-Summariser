the material portion of an order of detention made under 3 of the preventive detention act 1950, ran as fol lows: 675 "whereas the government of bombay is satisfied with respect to the person known as j. n . . that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order it is necessary to make the following order: now, therefore, . . the gov ernment of bombay is pleased to direct that the said j.n. be detained.
by order of the governor of bombay (sd.) v.t.d. secretary to the government of bombay, home department".
the high court of bombay held that the order was defec tive as it was not "expressed to be in the name of the governor" within the meaning of article 166 (1) and was not accordingly protected by article 166 (2): held, that the order was not defective merely because it stated that the government of bombay was satisfied and that the government of bombay was pleased to direct that j.n. be detained, and, though the addition of the words "and in his name" to the words "by order of the governor of bombay" would have placed the matter beyond controversy, the order was really one expressed to be taken in the name of the governor of bombay within article 166.
held further, that, assuming that the order was defec tive it was open to the state government to prove by other means that such an order has been validly made.
it is not absolutely necessary in every case to call the minister in charge; if the secretary or any other person has the requi site means of knowledge and his affidavit is believed, that will be enough.
verification should invariably be modelled on the lines of o. xix, r. 3, of the civil procedure code, whether the code applied in terms or not, and when the matter deposed to is not based on personal knowledge the sources of informa tion must be clearly disclosed.
