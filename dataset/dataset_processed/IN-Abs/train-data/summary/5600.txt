% the respondents filed a writ petition in the high court for quashing the order dated 31.1.1984 of the authorities, informing the respondent union about the scheme of election to the works committee to be constituted for the period 1984 86, on the basis of division in different constituencies under the industrial disputes (central) rules, 1957, framed under the .
the high court held that such a distribution of constituencies was not permissible in view of the scheme of the rules, especially rules 39, 41.
42 and 43.
in the appeal by special leave, on behalf of the appellants it was contended that such a division of constituencies to give appropriate representation to various sections, groups and categories of workers, skilled, unskilled, clerical and otherwise, was justified under rule 39 and proviso to rule 43.
on behalf of the respondents, it was contended that while rule 42 contemplated only division in two constituencies, that is, those who were members and those were not, of a registered trade union, it further provided that where more than half the workers belonged to one registered trade union, there was no need for any division of constituencies, and election will be only by general vote of workers of the industry and, therefore, the high court was right in holding that the division of constituencies as contemplated in the aforesaid order was not permissible.
dismissing the appeal, 826 ^ held: the scheme of the industrial disputes (control) rules, 1957 for the constitution of works committee clearly provides that (a) where there is a registered trade union having more than so per cent membership of the workers in that establishment, the total number of members of the works committee will be elected without distribution of any constituencies; and (b) if in an industry, no trade union registered under the trade unions act represents more than 50 per cent of the members, then only the election will be held in two constituencies, one from the members of the registered trade union or unions and the other from non members of the trade unions and it is only in this contingency, it is further provided that, if the employer thinks proper, may further sub divide the constituency into department, section or shed.
[832c e] when there is a registered trade union in an establishment, having more than 50 per cent membership, the exercise under rule 43 of the industrial disputes (control) rules, 1957 is futile and is not called for.
[832f g] in the instant case since the respondent union 's membership is more than 50 per cent, the distribution of constituencies under rule 42 is not contemplated and, therefore, there is no occassion for rule 43 or proviso therein to come into operation.
