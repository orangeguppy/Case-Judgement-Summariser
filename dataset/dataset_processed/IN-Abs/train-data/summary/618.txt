the appellant was appointed as overseer by the municipal board, kanpur, on march 5, 1937, and continued in its service up to march 19, 1951, when a copy of the resolution passed by the board on march 5, 1951, purporting to dismiss him from service was handed over to him.
on april 7, 1951, he filed an appeal to the government against the order of dismissal from service, but he was informed on april 8, 1952, that his appeal was rejected.
thereafter on december 8, 1952, the appellant instituted a suit challenging the legality of the order of dismissal on various grounds, and the question arose whether the suit was within time.
sub section (i) of section 326 of the u. p. municipalities act, 1916, provided that no suit shall be instituted against a municipal board " until the expiration of the two months next after notice in writing has been left at the office of the board. explicitly stating the cause of action " ; and sub section
(3) stated that " no action such as is described in sub section
(1) shall. be commenced otherwise than within six months next after the accrual of the cause of action ".
the appellant contended that the cause of action accrued to him on april 8, 1952, when the order of dismissal of his appeal to the government was communicated to him and the suit, filed within eight months of that date, was within time, and relied on the provisions of section 58 (1) and (2), read with section 69, of the act, which gave an officer dismissed by the board a right of appeal to the government within 30 days of the communication to him of the order dismissal : held, that though the order passed by the board on march 5, 1951, was subject to a right of appeal to the government, the operation of the order was not suspended by the mere filing of the appeal, and the order became effective from march 19, 1951, when it was communicated to the appellant.
the cause of action, therefore, accrued to him on that date, and the suit filed by him on december 8, 1952, was barred by limitation under section 326 of the u. p. municipalities act, 1916.
