as a result of the accident, the constable died and his widow and children claimed compensation, before the tribu nal.

96 provides that the insurer is not liable to satisfy the judgments against the persons insured if there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy.
one of the conditions of the policy specified under clause (ii) is that the vehicle should not be driven by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person, who has been disqualified from holding or obtaining driving licence, during the period of disqualification.
it is not in dispute that the certificate of insurance concerned in this case contains this condition.
if, therefore, there is a breach of this condition, the insurer will not be liable to indemnify the owner.

in the present case, the onus of the insurer has been discharged from the evidence of the insured himself.
the insured took a positive defence stating that he was not the owner of the vehicle since he had already sold the same to a third party.
this had not been proved.
secondly, he took a defence stating that the vehicle at the relevant time was driven ' by a licensed driver.
this was proved to be false.
there is no other material even to indicate that the vehicle was entrusted to the licensed driver on the date of the fatal accident.
