" this agreement was registered on the 11th january.
on the 18th january, s submitted a draft will for sanction and the will as amended and sanctioned was executed on the 28th july, 1904.
this will provided as follows: "after my death my wife for her lifetime shall remain in possession of my entire estate without the power of any sort to transfer the said properties and rights, that on the death of the said wife all the aforesaid property and rights shall devolve on my cousin g with all proprietary powers and that on the death of g, the said entire property and rights shall devolve on x, y, z, sons of g, in the following shares . " the will also provided for maintenance for the daughter, sister, aunt and mother of section on the application of g 's sons (g having died) letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to them by the chief court of oudh and this decision was affirmed by the privy council on appeal in 1937.
the heirs of s thereupon instituted a suit against the sons of g for a declaration that the will was inoperative and ineffectual and that g 's sons had in any case no right to the properties of s, as s had no animus testandi and g had also failed to pay rs. 50 to s as agreed: held, (i) that the deed of agreement and the will formed parts of one transaction and formed one contract, consideration for the will being the agreement, and consideration for the agreement being the will; (ii) as the privy council had decided that the will was the last will and testament of s and granted letters of administration, the question of animus testandi was res judicata ; (iii) with regard to the plea that the monthly payment of rs. 50 was a condition precedent to the validity of the will and that by reason of the non fulfilment of this condition the will had become inoperative, such a plea was also barred by res judicata as the privy council bad granted letters of administration; and even on the merits the plea was untenable as the wife and other relations of the testator had also certain rights under the will which did not depend on the monthly payment by g; (iv) the question whether the payment of rs. 50 was a con dition precedent to the vesting of the legacy in g or g 'b sons was 915 not, however, res judicata and it was open to the plaintiff to raise such a plea; (v) on a proper interpretation of the terms of the agreement, the payment of rs. 50 per month was not a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy in g, but merely a consideration, and the plaintiffs ' remedy was to enforce the agreement if it was not duly performed; (vi) that as g obtained a vested remainder under the will, his interest did not fall into the residue on his death before the widow, but vested in his sons; and as the bequest to g did not lapse there was no question of any resulting trust or of any intestacy with respect to the remainder, and g 's sons were entitled to the estate under the will.
