the validity of the election of the appellant to the house of the people at the third general elections held in the month of february, 1962, was challenged by two of the electors of the constituency from which the appellant was elected, by filing election petitions for setting aside the election.
the nomination paper of b, one of the two electors aforesaid, had been rejected by the returning officer.
the appellant who was one of the respondents to the two election petitions raised preliminary objections to the maintainability of the petitions and pleaded that they should be dismissed on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that b whose nomination paper was rejected and who was not a contesting candidate was improperly impleaded as a respondent to the election petition in contravention of the provisions of section 82 of the representation of the people act, 1951, (2) that there was non compliance with the provisions of section 81 (3) of the act because the copy of the election petition served on the appellant was not a true copy of the original filed before the election commission, and (3) that there was non compliance with the provisions of section 83 of the act inasmuch as (a) the election petition was not verified in the manner laid down in section 83, and (b) the affidavit in respect of corrupt practices which accompanied the petition was neither properly made nor in the prescribed from.
held (1) that where all the parties whom it was neces sary to join under the provisions of section 82 of the representation of the people act, 1951, were joined as respondents to the 574 petition, the circumstance that a person who was not a necesary party had also been impleaded did not amount to a contravention of section 82 of the act; (2) the word "copy" in section 81 (3) of the act did 'not mean an absolutely exact copy but a copy so true that nobody could by any possibility misunderstand it, and that the test whether a copy was a true one was whether any variation from the original was calculated to mislead an ordinary person; in re hewer, ex parte kahan, (i 882) 1, relied on.
(3)that a defect in the verification of an election petition as required by section 83 (1) (c) of the act did not attract section 90 (3) and so was not fatal to the mintainability of the petition; and, (4)that a defect in the affidavit was not a sufficient around for dismissal of the petition.
