the respondent, a government servant, was suspended from service in 1960.
on receipt of the findings of the inquiry officer, a show cause notice was issued.
the appointing authority exonerated the respondent but did not make a reasoned order.
later, however, the case was reopened.
as the de novo recording of evidence progressed the respondent moved the high court contending that there was no power in the government to re open a case which had already been concluded by exoneration and re instatement.
the high court granted the relief .
dismissing the appeal of the sate, ^ held.
had the government servant misappropriated government money he should have been punished expeditiously.
but having been exculpated after enquiry, the state could go at him by re opening the proceedings only if the rules vested some such revisory power no rule of double jeopardy bars the reopening of the case.
but once a disciplinary case has closed and the official re instated the government cannot restart the exercise in the absence of specific power to review or revise vested by rules in some authority.
the basics of the rule of law cannot be breached without a legal provision or other vitiating factor invalidating earlier enquiry.
