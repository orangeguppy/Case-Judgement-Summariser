rules 2 and 6 of the rules framed under section 59 of the indian income tax act provide that an application for registration of a firm under section 26 a of the act and for renewal of registration certificate "shall be signed personally by all the parties".
held that the word 'personally ' in the income tax rules, as framed under section 59 of the income tax act would exclude a duly authorised agent of a partner of a firm signing an application on behalf of the partner under section 26 a of the income tax act.
(2) that rules 2 and 6 are not ultra vires the rule making authority.
to decide the question whether on its true interpretation the indian income tax act intended that an application under section 26 a should be signed by the partner personally, or whether it could be signed by his agent on his behalf the court must have regard not only to the language of section 26 a but also lo the character of the legislation, the scheme of the act and the nature of the right conferred by the section.
the indian income tax act is a self contained code exhaustive of the matters dealt with therein, and its provisions show an intention to depart from the common rule, qui facit per alium tacit per se.
its intention again is that a firm should be given benefit of section 23(5)(a), only if it is registered.
under section 26 a in accordance with the conditions laid down in that section and the rules framed thereunder.
and as those rules require the application to be signed by the partner in person, the signature by an agent on his behalf is invalid.
