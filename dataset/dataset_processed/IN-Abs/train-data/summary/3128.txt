coal was despatched from colleiries within british india in december 1946 and january and february 1947, to the appellant in indore.
the respondent filed a suit in 1953 for recovery of coal production cess levied under the coal production fund ordinance, 1944, and r. 3(1) of the coal production fund rules, 1944.
on the question whether the ordinance had no territorial operation to reach the appellant, because, he was a resident of a princely state at the time of dispatch of the coal.
held:in r. c. jall vs union of india, [1962] supp. 3 s.c.r. 436,.
it was held that the cess was an excise duty on the manufacture or production of coal and that the method of collection did not affect the essence of the duty.
the coal production cess was on the production of coal and was levied on coal dispatched from collieries in the then british india, that is, the taxable event happened within the then british india.
under the rules, the duty was to be collected by the railway administration as a surcharge on freight and was to be recovered from the consignee if the freight charges were to be collected at the destination.
the appellant was the consignee and the freight charges were to be collected from him at the destination, namely, indore.
the cess thus became a part of the freight for purposes of collection but in essence remained a tax on goods.
once the duty attaches to the goods they became impressed with the liability and the consignee was liable to pay.
the suit was filed in 1953 when indore was within india and the right of the union to claim, as well the liability of the appellant to pay, the cess, was valid and subsisting.
it was not a case of the union seeing or enforcing any revenure law in a foreign court.
therefore, the union was entitled to a decree against the appellant.
