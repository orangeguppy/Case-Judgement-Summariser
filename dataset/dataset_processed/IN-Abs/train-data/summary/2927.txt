the appellant was elected to the nagaland legislative assembly.
he was at the time of his election chief minister of the state.
the, respondent challenged the election of the appellant on the grounds : (i) the appellant incurred or authorised the incurring of expenditure beyond the prescribed limit in contravention of section 77 of the act and thereby committed corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123(6) of the act, (ii) he offered inducements to the electors by giving feasts and entertaining them and (iii) he distributed bundles of corrugated iron sheets to a women 's society, with the object of inducing the members thereof to vote for him.
the high court held that the appellant committed corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123(6) and set aside his election.
the other corrupt practices were held not proved.
allowing the appeal and dismissing the election petition, held:(i) the high court was in error in holding on the evidence that expenditure beyond the prescribed limit was incurred or authorised by the appellant [663 f] (ii)there was no evidence to indicate that the appellant or any person with his consent or knowledge induced any of the voters to vote for him by offering them food.
on the contrary the evidence on both sides indicated that it was customary practice in nagaland to offer hospitality to the people who visit their house.
it would not be correct to equate ordinary hospitability or courtesy with corrupt practice.
(iii)there was no corrupt motive in the distribution of bundles of iron sheets.
the society asked for corrugated iron sheets for a public cause.
the appellant was the chief minister at the time of the election and it would not be unnatural for people to make request to the chief minister for a public cause.
it would also be reasonable to expect that the chief minister would try to redress the grievances of the people.
