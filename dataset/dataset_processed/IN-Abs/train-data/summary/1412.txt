the appellants submitted their returns of sales tax.
more than three months afterwards a complaint was filed against them under section 24(1)(b) and (g) of the c. p. and berar sales tax act ' alleging that the returns filed were false and that the accounts produced were incorrect.
they contended that the prosecution was barred by section 26(2) of the act which provided that no prosecution shall be instituted against any person in respect of anything done or intended to be done under the act unless it was instituted within three months from the date of the act complained of.

section 26(2) was thus clearly applicable to the case.
