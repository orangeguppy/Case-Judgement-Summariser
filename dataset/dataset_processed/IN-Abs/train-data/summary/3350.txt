the appellants were keepers of a public place namely, a bar.
they were convicted under section 3(1) of the suppression of immoral traffia in women and girls act.
1956, for keeping or managing a brothel in the bar, and under section 7(2)(a) for knowingly permitting prostitutes for the purpose of their trade to resort to or remain in the bar.
there was also a direction under section 18(1) read with section 18(2) of the act evicting, the appellants from the bar.
it was contended that the order of eviction was bad, because the bar was not within 200 yds.
of any public institution of the type referred to in section 18(1).
^ held : the magistrate has power to order eviction when there is a conviction either under section 3 or section 7.
[306 e] under section 18(1), when a magistrate receives information that a brothel is being run within a distance of 200 yds.
from certain specified types of public institutions, he may order the eviction of the occupier after hearing him.
under section 18(2).
once a court convicts a person under section 3 or section 7, it may pass orders under section 18(1) without further notice to such person to show cause as required in that sub section.
a close reading of section 18(2), however indicates that the orders under sub section (1) referred to therein do not wholesale import the substantive paragraph of section 18(1) but only the eviction orders contained therein.
f h] (a) the consequence of a conviction under section 3 is the invalidation of any lease of the premises where the brothel is run.
the logical consquence must be that the occupier must be thrown out of such premises.
this is achieved by the exercise of the power under section 18(2).
[305 b] (b) section 7(1) punishes prostitution in premises within a distance of 200 yds.
of specified places.
section 7(2)(b) punishes the person who permits the use of premises in his occupation for prostitution, and it is an ingredient of the offence that the premises must be within 200 yards distance of the specified places; but section 7(2)(a) punishes the keeper of any public place who knwingly permits prostitutes to resort to such place for their trade.
no question of distance arises with respect to such a conviction.
but section 18(2) empowers the court to pass orders under section 18(1) if there is a conviction under section 7 regardless of whether it falls under section 7(2)(a) or (b).
[305 c e] therefore, section 18(2) operates not merely on places within the offendin distance of 200 yds.
but in all places where the activity of prostitution had been conducted.
[305 g] (c) to dispel the ambiguity in section 18(2) it must be interpreted in such a way as to advance the remedy and suppress the evil.
if the purpose of extirpating the commercial vice from a place were to be successful the occupier must be expelled from there.
