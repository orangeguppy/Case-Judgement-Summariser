the respondent appeared in the intermediate examination and passed, but the appellant, instead of declaring her result, addressed a letter on may 24, 1961, to the principal of the college in which the respondent was studying, making enquiries regarding the respondent 's attendance.
according to the regulations, a candidate must attend 75% of the lectures given in each subject.
the principal, by her letter dated june 14, 1961, replied that the respondent was at one time short of attendance, that she made good the 'shortage in all subjects except one, but the shortage in that subject was due to the fact that lectures were not given in that subject the lecturer having been on leave.
by its letter dated july 6, 1961, the appellant cancelled the respondent 's result and no reference was made to the principal 's letter in the appellant 's letter.
the respondent thereupon filed a writ petition challenging the appellant 's order cancelling the result, and the high court allowed the petition.
in appeal to this court, held : the appellant should have given an opportunity to the respondent to present her case and pursuade the appellant not to cancel her result.
[269 c] whether a duty arises in a particular case to issue a show cause notice before inflicting a penalty does not depend on the authority 's satisfaction that the person to be penalised has no defence but on the nature of the order proposed to be passed.
in the present case, the impugned order imposed a penalty on the respondent as she was denied the fruits of her labour, and when passing it, the appellant was exercising quasi judicial functions.
