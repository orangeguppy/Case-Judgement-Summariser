m contended, inter alia, that the document was an agreement to lease under section 2(7) of the indian , and that as it was not registered it was inadmissible in evidence.
held, that an agreement to lease under section 2(7) of the regis tration act, 1908, must be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease.
an agreement between two parties which entitles one of them merely to claim the execution of a lease from the other without creating a pre sent and immediate demise in his favour is not an agreement to lease within the meaning of section 2(7) of the act.
held, further, that on a construction of the document in question, it was not intended to, and did not, effect an actual or present demise in favour of the respondent and consequently it was not an agreement to leaseunders.
2(7) of the act.
accordingly, the document did not require registration and was admissible in evidence.
