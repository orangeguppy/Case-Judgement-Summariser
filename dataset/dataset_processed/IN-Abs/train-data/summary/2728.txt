by section 7(2) of the u.p. (temporary) control of rent and eviction act, 1947, "the district magistrate may require a landlord to let or not let to any person any accommodation which is or has fallen vacant" and section 16 of the act provides that "no order made under this act by the state government or the district magistrate shall be called in question in any court.

whether there is a vacancy is a jurisdictional fact which could not be decided by him finally.
by reaching an erroneous decision, he cannot clothe himself with jurisdiction which he does not posses 'section it is only when the order is with jurisdiction that the order is not liable to be challenged in a civil court by virtue of section 16 of the.
