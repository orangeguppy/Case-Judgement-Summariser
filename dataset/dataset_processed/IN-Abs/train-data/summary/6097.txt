by way of writ petition under article 32 of the consti tution the petitioners sought relief against the imposition of customs duty at 150 per cent on their import of edible oils into india.
pursuant to the contract entered into by the petitioners with foreign sellers for the supply of edible oils the consignment of edible oils was sent by the ocean going vessel m.v. kotta ratu.
the vessel approached bombay and made its "prior entry" on 4 july, 1981.
it actu ally arrived and registered on 11 july, 1981.
as the port authorities at bombay were unable to allot a berth to the vessel, the vessel left for karachi for unloading other cargo intended for that port.
the vessel returned on 23 july 1981 and waited for berth.
on august 4, 1981 she was allowed to berth in princess docks 'c ' shed and the customs authori ties made the "final entry" on that date.
customs authorities are stated to have imposed duty on the import of edible oil at the rate of 150 per cent on the footing that the import was made on 31 july, 1981, the date of "inward entry".
the case of the petitioners was that the rate of duty leviable on the imports should be that ruling on 11 july, 1981, when the vessel actually arrived and registered in the port bombay and that but for the fact that berth was not available the vessel would have discharged its cargo at bombay and would have been liable to pay customs duty at the rate of 12.5% which was the ruling rate on that date i.e., 11 july, 1981.
the petitioners contended that the rate should not have been more than 42.5% because that was the rate of customs duty ruling on 23 july, 1981 when the vessel entered the port of bombay.
the court rejecting the claim of petitioners, 368 held: the rate of duty and tariff valuation has to be determined in accordance with section 15(1) of the customs act.
under section 15(1)(a), the rate and valuation is the rate and valuation in force on the date on which the bill of entry is presented u/s 46.
according to the proviso, however, if the bill of entry has been presented before the entry inwards of the vessel by which the goods are imported, the bill of entry shall be deemed to have been presented on the date of such entry inwards.
[373b c] the date on which a bill entry is presented under section 46 is, in the case of goods entered for home consumption, the date relevant for determining the rate of duty and tariff valuation.
where the bill of entry is presented before the date of entry inwards of the vessel, the bill of entry is deemed to have been presented on the date of such entry inwards.
[375b] the amendment made in section 16 of the act appears to have been made by way of clarification and does not detract from the conclusion that "the date of entry inwards of the ves sel" is the date recorded as such in the customs register.
[375f] in the present case, "the date of inwards entry" is mentioned as 31st july, 1981.
in the absence of anything else, it may be taken that the entry was recorded on that date itself.
accordingly, the rate of import duty and the tariff valuation shall be that in force on 31st july 1981.
the contention of the petitioners that the rate of import duty and tariff valuation will be that ruling on july 11, 1981 cannot be sustained and is rejected.
