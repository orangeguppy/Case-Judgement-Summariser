the appellant and the respondent applied for a permit of stage carriages.
the respondent secured higher marks than the appellant.
the road transport authority preferred the appellant on the compassionate ground that the respondent already had another permit on a route which was partly over lapping over the route in question.
on an appeal the appellate tribunal set aside the order of the transport authority and granted the permit to the respondent.
dismissing the appeal, held: permits cannot be equated with distribution of patronage.
public interest is at stake when public trans port services are operated.
the scheme of the motor vehi cles act and the rules is that he who can serve the travel ling public best is to be chosen as the permit holder.
considerations of grace, charity and compassion at the expense of public interest are an act of unfairness to the act.
