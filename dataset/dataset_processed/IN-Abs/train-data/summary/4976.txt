para 2(ii) of the letter dated september 19 , 1984 of the ministry of law , justice & company affairs is a clear departure from para 2 clause (a) of schedule i to the , 1954.
under clause (a) of para 2 of the schedule i to the act , the retiring judges ' entire service as a judge has to be reckoned for the purpose or calculating his pension and for that purpose the last pay drawn by him had to be the pay drawn by him as a judge of the high court and not the pay that would have been drawn by him as a district judge , had he not been appointed a high court judge.
[612c d ] in the instant case the petitioner had put in a total service of more than 38 years and 9 months including his service as a high court judge and his last pay drawn was rs.3,500 per month , his pension would be rs.1,525 per month.
but since the rajasthan rules prescribed a ceiling of rs. 1,500 per month , he was entitled to a pension of rs.1,500 per month only under clause (a) of para 2 of schedule i.
to this , the additional pension to b added under clause (b) was rs.700 x 9 rs.6,300 but here again the ceiling prescribed was rs.3,500 per annum.
the total pension would therefore be rs.21,500 per annum.
but 1) for the ceiling prescribed under the rajasthan rules and clause (b) of para 2 of schedule i of the act , he would have been entitled to rs.24,600 per annum.
