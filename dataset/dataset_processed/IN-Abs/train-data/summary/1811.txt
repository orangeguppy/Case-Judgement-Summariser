the respondent company paid to its employees rs. 1,08,325/ as bonus for the year 1947 in the calendar year 1949, as a result of the award of the industrial tribunal dated january 13, 1949.
this amount was debited by the company in its profit and loss account for the year 1948 and the corresponding credit was given to the bonus payable account.
the books for 1948 were not closed till the date of the award of the industrial tribunal.
for the relevant assessment year, 1950 51, the company claimed that under section 10(2)(x) of the indian income tax act, 1922, it was entitled to an allowance in respect of the amount paid as bonus, but the claim was rejected by the income tax authorities on the ground that according to the mercantile system of accounting which was followed by the assessee the year to which the liability was properly attributable was the calendar year 1947 and not 1949.
it was the case of the income tax authorities that it was a legal liability of the assessee which arose in 1947 and should have been estimated and put into the accounts for 1947, and that, if necessary, the amounts for the year 1947 should be reopened.
it was admitted that the bonus in the instant case was a profit bonus.
held:(i) it was only when the claim to profit bonus, if made, was settled amicably or by industrial adjudication that a liability was incurred by the employer, who followed the mercantile system, within section 10(2)(x), read with section 10(5), of the indian income tax act, 1922; and as it was only in 1949 that the claim to profit bonus was settled by an award of the industrial tribunal, the only year the liability could be properly attributed to was 1949.
(ii) the system of reopening accounts was not applicable under thescheme of the indian income tax act.
(iii) the words "year in question." in proviso (b) to s.10 (2)(x) of the act meant "year in respect of which bonus was paid".
