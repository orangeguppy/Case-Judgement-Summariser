in so serious a crime as murder where so severe a sentence as life imprisonment has been inflicted by the trial court and the appeal is as of right, the high court must indicate in a reasoned judgment that it has applied its mind to the material questions of fact and law.
a judgment may be brief but not a blank especially in a situation such as this.
