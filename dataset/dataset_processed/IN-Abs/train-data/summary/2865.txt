the high court granted certificate for leave to appeal to this court in a case where it set aside the ex parte decree in the suit and restored the suit to the me of the trial court.
held: the certificate granted by the high court was premature and was not competent.
as a result of the setting aside of the decree the suit was very much alive, and it could not be treated as a final adjudication of the suit itself.
the constitution contemplates the filing of an appeal by certificate only against a judgment, decree of final order of the high court.
it does not contemplate bringing an appeal in a suit which is still a live suit and in which further proceedings are to be taken.
