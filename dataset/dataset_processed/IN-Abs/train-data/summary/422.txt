the appellant, a displaced person, bad a fixed deposit in the lahore branch of the respondent bank which had its head office at simla, and he also had at the time a cash credit account in the bank.
as the bank refused to pay the amount of fixed deposit on its maturity but adjusted it towards part payment of the amount said to be due from him, he filed an application to the tribunal at banaras under section 4 of the , claiming the amount of the fixed deposit as a debt due from the bank.
during the pendency of the application there were proceedings taken for winding up the bank in the high court of punjab.
on the 3rd january 1953 a decree was passed by the tribunal and the appellant filed an application before it for execution of the decree, which, ultimately, was transferred to the bombay high court under the provisions of the code of civil procedure.
the appellant 's application before the bombay high court for the attachment of the property belonging to the bank and situate in bombay was ordered on the 18th june 1954.
on the 26th june 1954 the official liquidator of the bank obtained an order from the punjab high court purporting to be one under section 45 c of the banking companies act, transferring to itself from the court of the banaras tribunal the proceedings before it for execution of the decree obtained against the bank by the appellant, and subsequently the order of attachment passed by the bombay high court was set aside by the high court of punjab on the ground that (1) the provisions of the banking companies act as amended in 1953 had an overriding effect, and that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the punjab high court notwithstanding anything in the displaced persons (debts adjustment) act, 1951 and (ii) there was a valid order of transfer to the punjab high court, of the execution proceedings taken by the appellant in respect of his decree.
