the appellant booked rice for being transported by train, from bareilly railway station to trivandrum railway station.
on delivery, the rice was found to be damaged and short in quantity.
the appellant claimed damages from the respondent, who resisted the claim on the grounds that the suit was not maintainable as the union of india had not been impleaded as a defendant, and that a suit by a state against the union of india could only be instituted in the supreme court under article 131 of the constitution.
the suit was dismissed by the trial court, and an appeal from it was dismissed by the high court.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: the southern railway is owned by the union of india.
as such, a suit dealing with the alleged liability of that railway should have been brought against the union of india.
section 80 of the c.p.c. contemplates institution of a suit against the central government even though it relates to a railway.

(2) neither the definition of the "railway administra tion" in section 3(6) of the indian railways act, nor the language of sections 72 to 80 of the act, lends support for the view that the railway administrations are to be treated as separate personalities, entries or separate juridical persons.

overruled.
(3) the demarcation of the different state owned rail ways as distinct units for administrative and fiscal pur poses cannot have the effect of conferring the status of juridical person upon the respective railway administrations or their general managers for the purpose of civil suits.
