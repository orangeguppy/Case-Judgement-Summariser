the petitioner was detained under section 12 (1) of the national security act on the grounds that he, alongwith his friends, in the second week of november, 1980 indulged in filthy abuse of muslims, threatened their lives and performed "marpeet" and that he and his associates terrorised the common man in the area by their various criminal acts which caused disturbance to the public peace and public safety.
in support of the petition it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the reference to associates without naming even one rendered the ground vague and, therefore, vitiated the order of detention and (2) that the incidents enumerated in the second ground related to the years 1974, 1975, 1977 and 1978 which could not be said to be proximate enough to sustain the order of detention.
allowing the petition, ^ held: the detenu is entitled to be released.
it is now well settled that grounds of detention must be pertinent and not irrelevant, proximate and not state, precise and not vague.
irrelevance, staleness and vagueness are vices any single one of which is sufficient to vitiate the order of detention.
[83 d] in the instant case the incidents enumerated to substantiate the second ground show that apart from the vice of staleness from which they suffer, they were related to "law and order" and not to the maintenance of public order.
they are stale because of the passage of time since the happening of some of the incidents; they are irrelevant because they related to law and order and not to maintenance of public order.
