paragraph 516 b of the manual for the superintendence and management of jails in punjab provides for premature release of prisoners.
the state government had issued in structions in 1971 modifying the executive instructions in paragraph 516b, to the effect that a convict must have undergone 8 1/2 years of substantive sentence before his case could be submitted to the government for consideration.
again there was another executive instruction in 1976 which provided that cases of convicts who were sentenced to death and whose sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment would not be submitted to the state government for consideration unless the convict has undergone atleast 14 years of substantive imprisonment.
paragraph 631 of the said manual relates to remission of sentences.
the note below paragraph 631 reproduces the gist of paragraph 516 b. going by the preface of the manual, paragraph 631 has statutory force whereas paragraph 5 16b being in the nature of executive instruction has no statutory force.
the respondents filed criminal writ petitions before the high court praying for their premature release on the basis that the note under paragraph 631 has statutory force, the executive instructions issued in 1971 and 1976 have to be ignored and that the jail superintendent was bound to submit their cases to the government for premature release.
148 the high court allowed the claim of the respondents and held that the executive instructions issued in 1971 and 1976 being in conflict with the statutory note must give way to the latter.
these appeals, by special leave, preferred by the state government challenge the high court 's decision on the ground that the source of paragraphs 516 and the note at the foot of paragraph 631 being the same, viz., resolution dated 6th september, 1905, it cannot be concluded that the note being an integral part of the statutory rule incorporated in paragraph 631 must receive the same character and in case of conflict between the two, the note which is statutory in character must prevail.
allowing the appeals, this court, held: 1. remissions by way of reward or otherwise cannot cut down the sentence awarded by the court except under section 432 of the criminal procedure code or in exercise of constitutional power under article 72/161 of the constitu tion.
remission cannot detract from the quantum and quality of the judicial sentence except to the extent permitted by section 432 of the code, subject of course to section 433a, or where the clemency power under the constitution is in voked.
the power under articles 72 and 161 of the constitu tion is absolute and cannot be lettered by any statutory provision such as sections 432, 433 and 433a of the code.
this power cannot be altered, modified or interfered with in any manner whatsoever by any statutory provisions or prison rules.

remission schemes are introduced to ensure prison discipline and good behaviour and not to upset sentences.
if the sentence is of imprisonment for life, ordinarily the convict has to pass the remainder of his life in prison but remissions and commutations are granted in exercise of power under sections 432 and 433 cr.
p.c., carving out an exception in the category of those convicts who have already enjoyed the generosity of executive power on the commutation of death sentence to one of life imprisonment.
even in such cases section 433a of the code or the executive instruction of 1976 does not insist that the convict pass the remainder of his life in prison but merely insists that he shall have served time for at least 14 years.
in the case of other 'lifers ' the insistence under the 1971 amendment is that he should have a period of atleast 8 1/2 years of incarceration before release.
the 1976 amendment was possibly introduced to make the remission scheme consistent with section 433a of the code.
since section 433a is prospective, so also 149 would be the 1971 and 1976 amendments.

according to the preface only those paragraphs which are blacklined have statutory character.
the note in ques tion is not so blacklined.
the source of paragraph 516b and the note is the very same resolution no. 159 167 of the government of india dated 6th september, 1905.
it is diffi cult to believe that the same resolution was intended to be a mere executive instruction in one part of the manual and was intended to be conferred a statutory character in anoth er.
the marginal note to the note in question in terms refers to paragraph 516 b which means it was merely a repro duction of the latter paragraph.
in the circumstances, if the note was intended to be conferred a statutory character, it would have been blacklined in keeping with the scheme of the manual.
paragraph 631 classifies prisoners and fixes the duration of their sentences e.g., 20 years for life convicts and class 3 prisoners and 25 years for class 1 and 2 prison ers.
the note at the foot of the paragraph is by way of a reminder that notwithstanding the duration fixed under the said rule, paragraph 5 16b requires that cases of such prisoners should be submitted on the expiry of the duration fixed under paragraph 516b.
it is, therefore, clear that the note is neither an integral part of paragraph 631; nor does it have statutory flavour as held by the high court.
