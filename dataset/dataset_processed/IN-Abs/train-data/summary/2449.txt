by a writ petition under article 226 of the constitution the respondent challenged the validity of a notice under section 226( 3 ) of the income tax act, 1961, in respect of tax due from him for the four assessment years from 1960 61 to 1963 64 and penalty for the assessment year 1962 63.
for the assessment year 1961 62 the assessment proceedings against the respondent were taken and concluded under the income tax act, 1922, and as a result of an appeal filed by the respondent, the tax liability was reduced by the appellate assistant commissioner.
the i.t.o. thereafter issued a notice to the respondent on december 11, 1963, under section 156 of the 1961 act requiring him to make payment within 35 days.
this period expired on january 22, 1964.
the impugned notice under section 226(3) was issued much later on april 23, 1965.
it was contended on behalf of the respondent that both the assessment order as well as the appellate order having been made under the 1922 act, the provisions of section 226 of the 1951 'act were not applicable.
as regards the. penalty sought to be recovered under the impugned notice for the assessment year 1962 63 and tax for 1963 64, it was contended by the respondent that as notices of demand had been served on him for payment of the two sums and the time given in the notice was due to expire on may 21, 1965, the impugned notice dated april 23, 1965 issued prior to the expiry of the time given to him was illegally issued; furthermore, the amount of tax must be "due to be paid by the assessee before a notice can be issued under section 225(3)of the 1961 act.
in respect of the assessment for 1960 61, it was contended before the high court that the i.t.o. did not properly exercise the statutory discretion vested on him in issuing the impugned notice when there was an appeal pending against the order of assessment before the appellate assistant commissioner.
the high court allowed the petition and accepted all the respondent 's contentions.
it also held that action under section 226 of the 1961 act was possible only in the case of an assessee who was "in default" and that in the case of an assessment under the 1922 act, no notice under section 156 of the new act was possible and there was no way of taking advantage of the provisions for the 'recovery and collection of tax contained in sections 220 to 234 of the new act.
on appeal to this court, held: the impugned notice under s, 226(3) was valid and the writ petition must be dismissed.
30 (i) the income tax officer had authority to issue the.
notices under section 156 and section 226(3) of the new act with respect to the liability of the respondent under the old act.
the high court was therefore in error in holding that the impugned notice was inoperative in regard to the amount to be recovered for the assessment year, 19 '51 62.
[37 d] the high court had wrongly based its opinion on the premise that all recoveries are possible "only when the stage mentioned in section 220(4) was reached, namely, that the assessee had become or deemed to have been an assessee "in default" and the action under section 226 could be taken only when an assessee was in default.
the effect of the reasoning adopted by the high court on this point is that the provisions of section 297(2) of the new act are nullified and an interpretation of section 226(3 ) of the new act which leads to such a startling result should be avoided as it is opposed to all sound canons of interpretation.
[37 e g] in a case falling within section 297(2)(j) of the new act, for example in a proceeding for recovery of tax and penalty imposed under the old act, it not required that all the sections of the new act relating to recovery and collection should be literally applied but only such of the sections will apply as are appropriate in the particular ease and subject, if necessary, to suitable modifications.
in other words, the procedure of the new act will apply to the cases contemplated by section 297(2)(j) of the new act routatis mutandis.

the assessments of tax and penalty for 1962 63 and 1963 64 had been made against the respondent and the demand notices had also been issued under section 156 of the new act.
it was not therefore possible to contend that the amount of tax and penalty were not ',due from the assessee" on april 23, 1965 when the impugned notice under section 226(3) was issued.
