the appellant was assessed to agricultural income tax by the assistant collector, banaras, u.p. act 3 of 1949, under which assessment was made, mentioned only the 'collector ' a.,, competent to make assessment.
the assessment made by the assistant collector was therefore set aside by the collector.
subsequently the law was amended by u.p. act 14 of 1956 to provide that the word 'collector ' would include 'assistant collector ' and that the collector could review his earlier orders quashing assessments on the ground of want of jurisdiction, if application for review were made to him by any of the parties within 90 days of the coming into force of the amendment.
such application having been filed in the appellant 's case, the collector set aside his earlier orders quashing the assessment, and the assistant collector made a fresh assessment.
the fresh assessment was challenged by the appellant by writ petition in the high court and having failed there, the appellant came to the supreme court by special leave.
it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the assessment made by virtue of the provisions of the amending act was barred by limitation because the retrospective operation of the provisions relating to jurisdiction would not extend the time for making the assessment.
held : the collector 's order on the review application had the effect of restoring the earlier proceedings.
no question of limitation could possibly arise, for those proceedings were initiated in time and must be deemed to have been pending throughout, and the fresh assessment was made in those very proceedings.
