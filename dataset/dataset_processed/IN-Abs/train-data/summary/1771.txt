the appellant company owns several estates wherein tea is grown and it was assessed to sales tax by the sales tax officer in respect of the tea sold by it during the years 1954 55 and 1955 56.
an appeal filed by the appellant was rejected by the, appellate assistant commissioner on the ground that the tea when sold was admittedly in godowns in the state of travancore cochin and that consequently the sales must be deemed to have taken place within the state of travancore cochin and hence liable to be included in the taxable turn over.
when a further appeal was taken to the sales tax appellate tribunal, it was held that the property in the goods sold passed at fort cochin in madras state on the fall of the hammer at the auction and hence the same was not taxable.
the state filed a revision petition to the high court.
while the high court accepted the finding of the tribunal that the property in the goods sold passed at fort.
cochin on the fall of the hammer at the auction, it differed from the tribunal as regards the effect of the circumstance that the tea sold was, at the point of sale, physically in godowns situated in the state of travancore cochin and held the sales to be taxable.
the appellant came to this court after obtaining a certificate of fitness from the high court.
the only question argued before this court was whether a sale of tea effected by the appellant by auction at fort cochin in madras state was a sale outside the state of travancore cochin orinside it and whether the same was taxable or not.

the test for determining whether a sale is inside or outside a state is where the property in the goods passed and in the present case the property in the goods passed in fort cochin in madras state on the fall of the hammer at the auction.
the point about the property not having passed in the madras state was not argued before the high court and was also not urged in the statement of case filed by respondent and hence the same was not allowed to be argued in the supreme court.
