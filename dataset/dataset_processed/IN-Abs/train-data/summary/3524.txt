the appellant and respondent no. 8 applied for the vacant post of professor of anthropology in the faculty of arts, in answer to an advertisement put up by the lucknow university.
a selection committee of five persons including three experts, interviewed them and recommended respondent no. 8 for the post.
the appellant 's writ petition challeng ing the recommendation was dismissed by the high court.
the appellant contended before this court that two of the expert members of the selection committee were unduly biased against him and in favour of respondent no. 8.
the appeal was contested on two grounds.
firstly, that by submitting to the jurisdiction of the selection committee, the appellant had waived his right to denounce its constitution and sec ondly, that the impugned recommendation being an interlocu tory proceeding against which remedies were available, the writ petition was not maintainable.
dismissing the appeal, the court, held: 1.
