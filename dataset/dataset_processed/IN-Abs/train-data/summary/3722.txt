the appellants entered into an agreement with the re spondents on march 24, 1964, for purchasing the suit proper ty belonging to the latter.
the terms of the agreement provided that the appellant would get the sale deed executed upto may 24, 1964, and in case of his failure to do so, the earnest money paid by him to the respondent would stand forfeited.
the sale deed was not executed within the pre scribed time, and the appellant filed a suit against the respondents for breach of contract.
the trial court granted him the relief of specific performance of the contract.
the respondents succeeded in an appeal before the high court on the ground that time was of the essence of the contract and therefore the relief of ' specific performance could not be granted, and also that the appellant had not been ready to perform his part of the contract.
allowing the appeal by certificate, the court, held: (1) fixation of the period within which the con tract has to be performed does not make the stipulation as to time, the essence of the contract.
when a contract re lates to sale of immovable property it will normally be presumed that the time is not the essence of the contract.
the intention to treat time as the essence may be evidenced by circumstances which are sufficiently strong to displace the normal presumption.
