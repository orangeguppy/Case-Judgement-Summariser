three principles of criminal jurisprudence which are well settled are as under: (i) that the onus ties affirmatively on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and it cannot derive any benefit from weak ness or falsity of the defence version while prov ing its case; (ii) that in a criminal trial the accused must be presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty; and (iii) that the onus of the prosecution never shifts.
[444 g h, 445 a] 3.
under section 105 of the evidence act the onus of proving exceptions mentioned in the indian penal code lies on the accused but the said section does not at all indicate the nature and the standard of proof required.
it is suffi cient if the, accused is able to prove his case by the standard of preponderance of probabilities as envisaged by section 5 of the evidence act.

the accused succeeds if the probability of his version throws doubt on the presecution case.
he need not prove his case to the hilt.
it is sufficient for the defence to give a version which competes in probability with the prosecution version for that would be sufficient to throw suspicion on the prosecution case entailing its rejection by the court.
[445 b c] 4.
in a criminal trial it is not at all obligatory on the accused to produce evidence in support of his defence and for the purpose of proving his version he can rely on the admissions made by prosecution witnesses or on the documents filed by the prosecution.
the courts below were not justified in drawing adverse inference against the accused for not producing evidence in support his defence.
the prosecution cannot derive any strength or support from the weakness of the defence case.
[446 e g] 5.
the courts below erred in basing conviction of the appellant on the sole testimony of the nazir completely ignoring the important admissions made in favour of the accused by other prosecution witnesses, some of whom were declared hostile and some were .not.
[446 h, 447 a] 6.
no explanation is coming forth why the secretary, works department who was a government servant, has not been examined.
it was a part of the prosecution case that in the said meeting the secretary did not direct the appellant to go to the village for making payment.
the prosecution ought to have examined the accountant who was a material witness in order to unfold the prosecution narrative itself.
the court drew adverse inference for his non examination.
[447 d:e] 7.
section 154 of the evidence act confers.
a discretion on the court to permit a witness to be cross examined by a party calling him.
the section confers a judicial discretion and must be exercised judiciously and properly in the inter est of justice.
the court will not nor.m.
ally allow a party to cross examine his own witness and declare the same hostile unless the court is satisfied that the statement of the witness exhibits an element of hostility.
or that he has resiled from a material statement which he made before an earlier authority.

merely because a witness in an unguarded moment speaks the truth which may not suit the prosecution or which may be favourable to the accused, the discretion to allow the party concerned to cross examine his own witnesses cannot be allowed.
the contingency _of permitting the cross examina tion of the witness by the party calling him is an extra ordinary phenomenon and permission should be given only in special cases.
[449 g h, 450 c] 8.
on the facts the court found that the trial court wrongly exercised its discretion in permitting the prosecu tion to cross examine its own witnesses.
[451 f] 9.
merely because a witness is declared hostile it does not make him unreliable so as to exclude his evidence from consideration altogether.

the court found that the defence version was ren dered probable by the testimony of witnesses as well as documents.
[457 a d] 11.
the court found that the nazir was not a reliable witness and that the courts below ought not to have acted on his sole testimony.
