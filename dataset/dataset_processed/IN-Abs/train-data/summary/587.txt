the appellant was the auction purchaser of the property at a revenue sale held under the provisions of the berar land revenue code, 1928, for recovery of land revenue due.
the property at the time of the attachment and sale was in the possession of a receiver appointed under or. 40, r. i of the code of civil procedure by the bombay high court.
notice to the receiver, however, was not given of the attachment and sale of the property, nor was any leave of the court taken for the sale.
in a suit instituted by the receiver for a declaration that the sale was a nullity or, at any rate, was illegal and liable to be set aside, the auction purchaser contended that the sale without notice to 334 the receiver or without impleading him was not void but only voidable and that, in any event, the suit was barred by the provisions of sections i57 and 192 of the berar land revenue code, 1928: held, (i) that the sale was illegal in the absence of the leave of the court and the necessary notice to the receiver; (2) that the suit was not barred by any of the provisions of the code.
sub section (1) of section i57 of the code which bars the institution of a suit to set aside a sale is confined only to claims on the ground of irregularity or mistake in publishing or conducting the sale as referred to in section 56, and suits based on other grounds, including those referred to in sub section
(2) of section 157, are not within the prohibition of sub section
section 192 of the code is not applicable as the suit is not one simpliciter to set aside the sale held by the revenue authorities, but one for a declaration and consequential relief on the grounds taken by the receiver not covered by the specific provisions of the code for setting aside the sale which the several authorities under the code have been empowered to determine, decide or dispose of within the meaning of section 192(i).
