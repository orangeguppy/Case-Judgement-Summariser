section 13(1) of the finance act, 1950, provided if immediately before the 1st day of april, 1950, there is in force in any part b state. any law relating to income tax or supertax or tax on profits of business, that law shall cease to have effect except for the purposes of the levy, assessment and collection of income tax and super tax in respect of any period not included in the previous year for the purposes of assessment under the indian income tax act, 1922 for the year ending on the 31st day of march, 1951, or for any subsequent year, or, as the case may be, the levy, assessment and collection of the tax on profits of business for any chargeable accounting period ending on or before the 31st day of march, 1949.
" the appellant, a merchant carrying on his business in the erstwhile states of travancore and cochin, was assessed to income tax for the two accounting years 1122 m. e. (1946 1947) and 1123 m. e. (1947 1948) under the income tax law in force there, namely, the travancore income tax act of 1121 m. e. and the cochin income tax act of 1117 m. e. between 1947 and 1950 there were constitutional changes resulting in the integration of the two states, formation of the united state of travancore and cochin, accession of the latter to the dominion of india, and finally, its acceptance of the constitution of india whereby it became a part b state within the constitution of india.
the question of financial integration was considered by the indian states finances enquiry committee and on the basis of the recommendations made by it a financial agreement was entered into on february 25, 1950, between the president of india and the rajpramukh of the state of travancore cochin.
by article 277 of the constitution taxes leviable under the travancore income tax act or the cochin income tax act continued to be so levied until provision to the contrary was made by parliament by law.
such provision was made by the finance act, 1950, which extended the indian income tax act, 1922, to the state of travancore cochin, but by section 13(1) saved certain provisions of the travancore and cochin income tax acts.
in respect of the assessment for the accounting year 1124 m. e. the income tax officer of ernakulam rejected the appellant 's books of account as unreliable and made a " best of judgment " assessment by his order dated january 11, 1952.
on february 12, 1952, the income tax officer, ernakulam, issued four notices to the appellant, two under section 44 of the cochin income tax act and two under section 47 of the travancore income tax act stating therein that in consequence of definite information which had come into his possession, he had discovered that the income of the appellant 753 for the assessment years 1123 and ii24 m. e had been under assessed and that he proposed to re assess the said income ; and the appellant was asked to submit a return in respect of his total world income for the two years in question.
the appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the income tax officer to re assess his income and contended (1) that the assessment order dated january 11, 1952, made by the income tax officer for the accounting year 1124 m. e. being the only document on which the income tax officer relied for issuing a notice to the appellant, the requisite conditions for the application of the statutory provisions were lacking, (2) that section 13(1) of the finance act, 1950, did not have the effect of saving the provisions of the travancore income tax act or the cochin income tax act for the purpose of re assessment of income tax, and (3) that the financial agreement made between the president of india and the raj pramukh dated february 25, 1950, which received constitu tional sanctity in article 278 of the constitution, rendered the initiation of such re assessment proceedings unconstitutional and void : held, (1) that though the meaning of the phrase " definite information " in section 44 (1) of the cochin income tax act and section 47(1) of the travancore income tax act, must depend on the circumstances of each case, there must be a casual connection between the information and the discovery, referred to in the sections ; but discovery does not mean a conclusion of certainty at the stage of notice ; it is enough if the income tax officer forms an honest belief.
accordingly, the assessment order dated january 11, 1952, which disclosed a definite and systematic pattern of transactions for avoidance of tax not only in respect of the year covered by the order but spread over years anterior to it, amounted to information which, if honestly believed, would reasonably support the opinion of the income tax officer that there was a discovery of " escaped " income, etc., within the meaning of the sections ; firm jitanyam niymalram vs commissioner of income tax, a. 1.

(2)that the expression " levy, assessment and collection of income tax " in section 13(1) of the finance act, 1950, was wide enough to comprehend re assessment proceedings under section 47 of the travancore income tax act and section 44 of the cochin income tax act; commissioner of income tax, bombay presidency and aden vs khemchand ramdas, (1938) l. r. 65 1.

(3)that on a true construction of the recommendations of the indian states finances enquiry committee, the financial 754 agreement between the president of india and the rajpramukh did not render the impugned proceedings unconstitutional or void.
in the connected appeals, the respondents who were merchants doing business in the state of mysore, were assessed to income tax under the mysore income tax act, 1923, for the years prior to the integration of mysore with india.
but subsequent to the integration of mysore notices under section 34 of the mysore income tax act were issued against them for re assessment of income tax for the years prior to the integration.
the respondents contended that the income tax officer had no jurisdiction to issue such notices on the grounds (1) that under the finance act, 1950, the mysore income tax act, 1923, stood repealed on and from april 1, 1950, and section 13(1) of the former act kept alive the mysore act for the purpose of levy, assessment and collection of income tax, etc., for the period mentioned therein, but did not save section 34 of the mysore income tax act for the purpose of re assessment of income tax and, therefore, the notices issued under section 34 were without jurisdiction and authority, (2) that the financial agreement between the president of india and the rajpramukh of mysore, dated february 28, 1950, rendered the initiation of such re assessment proceedings unconstitutional and void, and (3) that the jurisdiction under section 34 of the mysore income tax act was limited to ascertainment of extra income not assessed and the section did not confer jurisdiction to make a new assessment under the act.
held, (1) that the finance act, 1950, empowered the income tax officer to take proceedings under section 34 of the mysore income tax act, for re assessment, for the prior years, of the under estimated or escaped income; (2)that the financial agreement dated february 28, 1950, did not render the proceedings for re assessment, unconstitu tional or void; and (3)that though there was a distinction between an original or normal assessment under section 23 and a re assessment under section 34 of the mysore income tax act, the expression " levy, assessment and collection of income tax " in section 13(1) of the finance act, 1950, had been used in a comprehensive sense so as to include the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the assessee.
