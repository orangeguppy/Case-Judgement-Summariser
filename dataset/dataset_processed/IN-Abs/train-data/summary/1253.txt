on the expiry of the appellant 's tenancy for the occupation of the premises indispute, the respondent who was the landlord filed a suit for possession of the premises.
meanwhile under section 6 of the bombay rents, hotel and lodging house rates control , a notification was issued applying part 11 of the act to the area where the property was situated.
the appellants claimed protection of section 12, part 11 of the act, which deprived the landlord of the right of possession under certain circum stances.
the court of first instance decided the suit against the appellant and the high court ruled that section 12 was prospective in character and did not apply to pending suits or proceedings.
on appeal by special leave held, that the point of time when sub section
(1) of section 12 operates is when the decree for recovery of possession has to be passed.
the language of the sub section which provides that the landlord is not entitled to recover possession if the tenant pays or shows his willingness to pay the standard rent and to observe the other conditions of the tenancy is such that it applies equally to suits pending when part it comes into force and those to be filed subsequently and is not limited only to suits filed after the act comes into force in a particular area.
a section may be prospective in one part and retrospective in another part.
sub sections (2) and (3) of section 12 were clearly prospective but the words of the first sub section showed retrospective operation.
