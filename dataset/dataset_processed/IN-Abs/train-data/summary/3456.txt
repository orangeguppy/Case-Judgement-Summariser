under section 3 of the , the respondent passed the andhra pradesh procurement (levy) order 1959, requiring every miller and dealer of rice (including the appellants) to sell to the respondent certain specified varieties and quantities of rice at controlled price on requisition being served on him.
clause 2(a) of the order defined "controlled price" as the maximum price fixed by the central government from time to time under section 3 of the act for the sale of rice.
on december 19, 1963, the central government passed the rice (andhra pradesh) price control order 1963, fixing the maximum price of akkulu rice at rs. 46.89 per quintal.

the appellant 's claim for the benefit of the enhanced price for the earlier sales was rejected by the government of andhra pradesh.
the appellants succeeded before the subordinate judge, machilipatnam in their suits for recovery of the difference between the two controlled prices but lost before the high court, in appeals preferred by the state of andhra pradesh.

dismissing the appeals, the court.
^ held: in the absence of express words or appropriate language from which retrospectivity may be inferred, a notification takes effect from the date it is issued and not from any prior date.
statutes should not be construed so as to create new disabilities or obligations or impose new duties in respect of transactions which were complete at the time the amending act came into force.
