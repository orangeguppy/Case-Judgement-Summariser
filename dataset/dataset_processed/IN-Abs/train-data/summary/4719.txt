the respondent who was a party to a subsisting contract with the government for widening or a road wrote a letter to the concerned executive engineer stating that he was closing the said contract.
1 he appellant contended that the contents of the letter did not have the effect of putting an end to the contract.
dismissing the appeal, ^ held: after the letter, the contract came to an end by breach and was no longer subsisting.
acceptance of the letter by the authorities was unnecessary for putting an end to the contract although the breach may give rise to an action for damages.
