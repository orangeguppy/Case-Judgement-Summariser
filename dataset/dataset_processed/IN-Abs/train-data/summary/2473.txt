in a defamation case, at the instance of the accused his personal appearance.
was dispensed .with by the magistrate under section 540 a cr.
his advocate was examined under section 342 at the close of the trial and the accused was convicted.
on the questions: (i) whether the pleader can represent the accused for purposes of section 342 and whether the examination of the pleader in place of the accused is sufficient compliance with the section in a case where the magistrate has dispensed with the personal attendance of the accused 'and permitted him to appear by a pleader; and (ii) whether mere non examination of the accused or defective examination under section 342 vitiates the trial, held: (i) the privilege of making a statement under section 342 is personal to the accused and the scheme, purpose and language of the section lead to the conclusion that only he and no body else can be examined under it.
if the statute gives the accused a personal privilege or imposes upon him a personal duty only he can exercise the privilege or perform the duty.
the second part of section 342 is mandatory and imposes upon the court a duty to examine the accused at the close of the prosecution case in order to give him 'an opportunity to explain any circumstances appearing against him in the evidence and to say in his defence what he wants to say in his own words.
the answers of the accused under section 342 is intended to be a substitute for the evidence which he can give under section 342 a and the privilege and duty of 'answering questions under section 342 cannot be delegated to a pleader.
though sections 205 and 540 a which empower a magistrate to dispense with the personal appearance of the accused do not expressly mention that the pleader cannot be examined under section 342, it does not lead to the inference that the pleader can be so examined.

(ii) under section 537 the conviction and sentence are not reversible on account of any error, omission or irregularity in 'any proceedings during the trial unless the error, omission or irregularity has in fact occasioned a failure of justice.
therefore the mere non examination of the accused in the present case, under section 342 was not a ground for interference since no prejudice was established.
