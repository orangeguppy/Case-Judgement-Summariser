[129 d e] 2.
butachlor which was the common name for cp 53619 was discovered, even prior to 1968 as a herbicide possessing the property of non toxic effect on rice.
the formula for the herbicide was published in the report of the international rice research institute for the year 1968 and its common name butachlor was also mentioned in the report of the international rice research institute for the year 1969.
no one patented the invention butachlor and it was the property of the population of the world.
before butachlor or for that matter any herbicide could be used for killing weeds, it had to be converted into an emulsion by dissolving it in a suitable solvent and by mixing the solution with an emulsifying agent.
emulsification is a well known process and is no one 's discovery.
neither butachlor nor the process of emulsification was capable of being claimed by the plaintiffs as their exclusive property.
[128 c e] in the instant case, the solvent and the emulsifier were admittedly not secrets and they were ordinary market products.
from the beginning to the end, there was no secret and there was no invention by the plaintiffs.
the ingredients, the active ingredients the solvent and the emulsifier, were known; the process was known, the product was known and the use was known.
the plaintiffs were merely camouflaging a substance whose discovery was known throughout the world and trying to enfold it in their specification relating to patent number 125381.
the patent is, therefore, liable to be revoked.
