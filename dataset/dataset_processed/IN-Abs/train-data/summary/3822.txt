if it could be so even at the trial stage, undoubtedly such a new question of fact could not be entertained at in appellate stage.
in this case, neither any issue was struck nor was any evidence adduced by the parties on the question.
the case pr to trial on the admitted footing that the business which the plaintiff wanted to shift to the suit shop was his business.
in such a situation it was not open to the appellants to take a stand at a very late stage of the litigation that the sweetmeat shop was the business of the joint family of the plaintiff and, therefore, not the plaintiff 's business to come within the meaning if clause (f) of sub s 1 of section 12 of the madhya pradesh accommodation control act, 1961.

(2)a tenanted shop in mere occupation of the landlord filing a suit for eviction against his tenant was sufficient to deny him a decree on the ground of clause(h) of section 4 of the madhya pradesh accommodation control act 1955 where the expression used was that the landlord "is not in occupation of any other accommodation in the city or town for that purpose".
but, under the 626 1961 act, mere occupation of another premises is not sufficient in view of the clear departure made by using the phraseology in the second part of cl.
