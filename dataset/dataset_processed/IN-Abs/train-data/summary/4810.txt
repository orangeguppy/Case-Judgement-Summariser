the which was also applicable to the tamil nadu electricity board provided for the payment of gratuity to employees who would retire after rendering service for a specified number of years.
the petitioner 's husband retired in 1976 after serving the tamil nadu electricity board for about 34 years and died three months thereafter.
the petitioner was paid her husband 's subscription to the contributory provident fund and interest and the electricity board 's contribution and interest and also the gratuity under the payment of gratuity act, 1972.

there is no justification for first dubbing it as a gratuity on the ground that it has some of the known characteristics of gratuity and then proceeding to deny the employees the befit of it on the ground that the board are paying gratuity under the .
if the special contribution has some common features with gratuity, it has also distinctive features which distinguish it from gratuity payable under the .
