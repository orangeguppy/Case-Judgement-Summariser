by cl. 3 of the kutch (application of laws) order, 1949, the bombay prevention of gambling act (bom.
iv of 1887) was made applicable to kutch.
clause 4 of the order provided that the acts applied to kutch by the order " shall be construed " as if (1) vs chester, mayor, etc.) 96 746 references therein to the authorities and territories were references to the authorities and territories of kutch as set out in that clause.
the words "shall be construed as " mean "shall be read as" and: consequently wherever in the bombay act the words " provincial government " or " government " are used, they have to be read as " chief commissioner of kutch and the words ,province or the presidency of bombay " as kutch or any part thereof ".
so understood, section 1 of the bombay act as applied to kutch provided that all or any of the provisions of that act may be extended from time to time by the chief commissioner of kutch by an order published in the official gazette to any, local area in kutch or any part thereof.
the contention that the bombay act had been validly extended to and was in force in the whole of kutch because of the kutch (application of laws) order, 1949, is not sound.
the true position is that the whole of the act including amended section 1 became applicable to kutch and, therefore, a notification was necessary before it could be brought into force in any part of kutch.
the chief commissioner issued a notification on november 28, 195o, bringing all the provisions of the bombay act into force throughout the whole of kutch with immediate effect.
the chief commissioner of kutch under section 1 of the bombay act, had powers to issue the notification making that act operative in kutch or in any part of kutch and those powers were not affected by article 239 of the constitution.
the notification was valid and the act came into force in the parts of the state to which the notification made it applicable.
