the assessee, an electricity supply undertaking, received certain sum of money for new service connections granted to its customers.
part of this amount was spent for laying mains and service lines.
the income tax officer treated the entire amount as trading receipt.
in appeal the appellate assistant commissioners excluded the cost of laying service lines and the mains and treated the balance as taxable income.
the appellate tribunal agreed with the appellate assistant commissioner and held that the service connection receipts were trading receipts and the "profit element" therein was taxable income in the hands (1)[1929] a.c. 386; 957 of the assessee.
in a reference under section 66(1) of the income tax act, the high court substantially agreed with the view of the tribunal.
on appeal by the assessee, held, that the high court erred in holding that the excess of the receipts over the amount spent by the assessee for installation of service lines was a trading receipt.
the receipts though related to the business of the assessee as distributors of electricity were not incidental to nor in the course of the carrying on of the assessee 's business.
they were receipts for bringing into existence capital of lasting value.
the total receipts being capital receipts the balance remaining after a part thereof was expended for laying service lines and mains, could not be regarded as 'profit ' in the nature of a trading receipt.
