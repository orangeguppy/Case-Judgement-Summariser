the sales tax authorities levied purchase tax u/s 9 of the haryana general sales tax act for the assessment years in question on the purchase of raw material made by the petitioners, computing the tax with reference ' to the purchase value of the goods exported against form h. hence the present writ petition before this court was filed challenging 454 155 the impugned order of levying purchase tax.

the petitioners contended that in view of the decision of this court in murli manohar 1991 [1] scc 377, the writ petitions were to be allowed.
disposing of the writ petitions, this court, section held: 1.1,.
the decision in murli manohar says that there can be only three types of sales, namely, intra state sales, inter state sales and export sales a nd no other.
a sale to an exporter would be either at% intrastate sale or an inter state sale; in either case, the decision says, it does not attract the purchase tax(on raw material) under section 9 of the haryana general sales tax act.
however, in the light of the decision in hotel balaji, it must be held that there is one more category in addition to the three categories mentioned above.
the fourth category is where a dealer in haryana takes his goods (out of haryana (without effecting a sale, within the state), and effects the sale in the other state.
according to section 9 of the haryana act, as explained in hotel balaji, purchase tax can be levied and collected on the raw material purchased by the manufacture within haryana, which was utilised for manufacturing the goods so sold in the other state.
