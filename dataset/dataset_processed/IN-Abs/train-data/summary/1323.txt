the lands in question which were within the permanently settled zamindari in the then presidency of madras, belonged to t who, during his lifetime, was cultivating the lands.
he died in 1885 leaving behind, inter alia, three daughters.
after the death of the three daughters, the last having died in 1935, the sons of one of them instituted a suit against the descendants of the other two for partition and separate possession of a third share, inter alia in the lands in question on the footing that t owned occupancy rights in the lands.
the suit was resisted on the plea that t had, no proprietary right in the lands, that he was only an annual tenant of the zamindar, that after his death the lands were held on similar tenure by different members by his family and that occupancy rights were acquired by those members of his family who were in possession of the lands when the madras estates land act, 1908, came into force in 1908.
there was no evidence to show that the occupation of the lands by t commenced under the zamindar, nor was there any evidence as to the terms on which he or his predecessors were inducted on the lands, the commencement of the tenancy and the terms thereof being lost in antiquity, but he and his descendants were proved to have continued in possession of the lands uninterruptedly till the enactment of the madras estates land act, 1908.
held, that in cases in which a ryot 's holding is not shown to have commenced subsequent to the permanent settlement, the presumption is that zamindar was only the holder 654 of the melvaram being the assignee of the government revenue, and that the kudivaram in the land belonged to the ryot who was entitled to continue in possession as long as he paid the rent regularly; and that this principle was applicable equally in a suit between persons claiming under the ryot as in a suit against the ryot by the zamindar.
case law relating to the rights of ryots in zamindaries in the madras presidency reviewed.
held, further, that t was the holder of the occupancy rights in the lands, , that these rights devolved upon his successors and that the said occupancy rights were not acquired by virtue of the provisions of the madras estates land act, 1908.
