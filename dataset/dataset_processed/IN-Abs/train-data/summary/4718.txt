the appellant, against whom an offence under sec.
307 i.p.c. had been registered for giving knife blows to a person was granted bail by the sessions judge.
on application by the state, a single judge of the high court cancelled the bail.
hence this appeal by special leave.
allowing the appeal, ^ held: very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an order seeking cancellation of the bail and the trend today is towards granting bail because it is now well settled that the power to grant bail is not to be exercised as if the punishment before trail is being imposed.
the only material considerations in such a situation are whether the accused would be readily available for his trial and whether he is likely to abuse the discretion granted in his favour by tampering with evidence.
[842 d e] in the instant case the order made by the high court is conspicuous by its silence on these two relevant considerations.
the learned judge was impressed by some of the most irrelevant considerations and misdirected himself.
the circumstances found by him that the victim attacked was a social and political worker could not be considered so overriding as to permit interference by the high court with the discretionary order of the sessions judge granting bail.
the high court completely overlooked the fact that it was not for it to decide whether the bail should be granted but the application before it was for cancellation on the bail.
