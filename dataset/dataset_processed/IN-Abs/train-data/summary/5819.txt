the public service commission invited applications for direct recruitment against 51 vacancies of assistant engineers in the andhra pradesh panchayat raj engineering service.
the number of vacancies was arrived at under the provisions of the andhra pradesh panchayat raj engineering service (special) rules 1963, on the basis of the total number of substantive as well as temporary vacancies which had arisen in the years 1978 and 1979.
explanation (c) in the special rules relating to the method of recruitment of assistant engineers, prior to its amendment on 28.4.1980.
provided that "out of every 8 vacancies among assistant engineers, the 2nd, 5th and 8th vacancies shall be filled in by direct recruitment . ".
the amended explanation (c) provided that "37 1/2 of the substantive vacancies arising in the category of assistant engineers shall be filled by direct recruitment . " some of the officers who were working as in charge assistant engineers or junior engineers in the panchayat raj department engineering service made representations to the state government raising objection to the number of vacancies notified for direct recruitment, contending that the 51 vacancies notified could not be filled up any longer by direct recruitment as, according tn them, after the amendment of the rules on 2x.4.1980, 37 l/2 per cent of only substantive vacancies could be filled up by direct recruitment.
while the vacancies notified had taken into consideration temporary vacancies also when their representation failed to elicit any positive reply from the state government, they instituted a petition before the andhra pradesh administrative tribunal.
before the tribunal the state government pleaded that the amendment made on 28.4.1980 to the special rules was only prospective in effect and had no effect on the pg no 805 pg no 806 vacancies which had arisen prior to that date.
the tribunal rejected the contention of the state government.
setting aside the judgment of the tribunal and remanding the case to it again, this court, held: (1) it is clear from the special rules as they were in force prior to the amendment on 28.4.1980 that it was open to the state government to fill 37 1/2 per cent of the vacancies (both substantive and temporary) in the cadre of assistant engineers by direct recruitment.
[811f] (2) the crucial words in the explanation which was introduced by way of amendment in the special rules on 28.4.1980 were "37 1/2 per cent of the substantive vacancies arising in the category of assistant engineers shall be filled by direct recruitment.
" the introduction of the word 'arising ' in the above clause made it applicable only to those vacancies which came into existence subsequent to the date of amendment.
[811h;812a b] (3) this court does not find any indication in the amendment that was made on 28.4.1980 that it would be applicable to the vacancies which had arisen prior to the date of the amendment even by necessary implication.[812e f] (4) the amendment made on 28.4.1980 therefore does not apply to the vacancies which had arisen prior to the date of the amendment.
