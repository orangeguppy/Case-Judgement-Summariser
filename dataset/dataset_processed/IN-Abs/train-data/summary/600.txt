the petitioners who were building contractors in the state of punjab were assessed to tax by the sales tax authorities on the supply of materials in construction works treating it as a sale, acting under the provisions of the east punjab general sales tax act, 1948.
the petitioners challenged the legality of the assessment proceedings on the grounds, inter alia, that the legislature of the province of punjab had, under entry 48 in list ii of sch.
i 'll to the government of india act, 1935, no power to impose tax on the supply of materials in construction works as there was no sale in fact or in law of those materials, and that the provisions of the act which sought to do it were ultra vires.
the assessing authorities contended that on a true construction of the building contract entered into by petitioners with the government it comprised a distinct agreement for the sale of materials and particularly relied on r. 33 of printed general conditions of contracts issued by the government : held, that there was no sale as such of the materials used in the constructions by the petitioners and that no tax could be levied thereon.
439 rule 33 which provides that the materials brought to the site shall become the property of the government but that when the works are finally completed the surplus materials shall revert and become the property of the contractor, has for its object that materials of the right sort are used in the construction and has not the effect of converting what is a lump sum contract for construction of buildings into a contract for the sale of materials used therein.
