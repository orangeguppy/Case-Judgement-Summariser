two persons were referred to as the election agents of the first respondent.
one of them was one of the candidates who had withdrawn and who was not made a party to the election petition.
the first respondent in his written statement contended that the petition should be dismissed under section 86(1) of the representation of the people act, 1951, as the candidate against whom corrupt practices were alleged and who was a necessary party under section 82(b) was not made a party to the election petition.
the appellant then filed an application for amendment of his petition wherein he stated that by 'election agent ' he never meant the candidate who had withdrawn, that there was never any intention to make any allegations against that candidate and that his name may be deleted from the petition, as he was not the first respondent 's election agent and reference to him was.
