where four persons shot at the deceased with the intention of killing him but under a misapprehension that he was some one else they could be found guilty of an offence under section 302 of the indian penal code, read with section 34 of the code.
it would be a case of killing the deceased in furtherance of their common intention to kill the other, and there would not be any necessity to invoke section 301 of the code to find them guilty.
in fact that section would apply only to cases where there was, no intention to cause the death, or knowledge that death was likely to be caused, of the deceased.
