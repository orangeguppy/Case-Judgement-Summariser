in civil appeal no. 855(n) of 1979 and civil appeal no. 2665 of 1991 the issue raised was common and relating to the date of merger of the two departments of the government of india, in the field of mines and minerals, namely (i) exploration wing of the indian bureau of mines (ibm) and (ii) geological survey of india (gsi).
between 1.1.1966 to 4.2.1969 thirty nine lower division clerks belonging to gsi were promoted as upper division clerks against the vacancies that arose in the gsi.
they were juniors to their counterparts in the ibm.
being aggrieved by the said promotions, the respondents who originally belonged to the ibm, preferred special civil application in the bombay high court for setting aside the seniority list and for a direction to consider their cases of promotion with effect from 1 january, 1966 and not from 4 february 1969 and therefore, there cannot be two separate channels of promotions from 1 january 1966 one from the employees of the exploration wing of ibm and another for the employees of gsi.
the appellants contended that the officers of gsi were promoted on the ground that the actual merger took place not on 1 january 1966 but on 4 february 1969.
the high court allowed the petition against which civil appeal no. 855(n) of 1979 has been preferred.
a senior technological assistant (geology) of the erstwhile ibm moved the karnataka high court for similar relief contending inter 894 alia that this case ought to have been considered for promotion in the merger cadre with effect from 1 january 1966.
the karnataka high court also allowed his claim with a direction to consider him for promotion with effect from 1 january 1966 in the merged cadre.
that decision was not implemented by the gsi.
in the contempt proceedings taken for disobedience of the judgment, the high court allowed six weeks time for compliance, against which, slp(c) no. 4906 of 1991 has been preferred.
respondents relying on the letters dated 10 december 1965 and 29 november 1966 contended in support of the decision of the high courts that the merger took place on 1 january 1966, whereas the appellants took assistance from terms of the letter dated 4/6 february 1969 in support of the counter plea.
allowing the appeals, this court, held: 1.
the statements in the letter make it abundantly clear that it was only administrative control of the relevant wings of ibm that were transfered to gsi with effect from 1 january 1966.
the letter does not refer to the decision of merger of the two departments.
[902e] 2.
the decision taken on the merger of the posts was communicated by subsequent letters dated 28 june 1967 and 4/6 february 1969.
by letter dated 28th june 1967 the government communicated the sanction of merger of class i ibm and gsi (proper) with immediate effect.
the letter also contains certain instructions to department about service conditions and seniority of persons in the amalgamated cadres of class i & ii posts.
the decision with regard to merger in respect of other categories of posts which include are concerned in these cases is contained in the letter dated 4/6 february 1969.
[902f g] 3.
the letter dated 4/6 february 1969 further provides the inter se seniority of the incumbent in the merged cadres will be governed in accordance with the principles laid down in the earlier letter dated 28th june 1967.
the merger/revision of the scales of pay does not involve any change in the nature of duties of the respective posts.
the officers concerned in the merged cadre will be given options in writing for opting the new scales of pay in the merged.
in case an individual concerned fails to exercise the option within the time limit, he will be treated to have accepted the new scale of pay.
it will be apparent from the terms of the letter dated 4/6 february 1969 that the posts 895 referred to in the letter were merged with gsi with effect from 4 february 1969 would be unnecessary and uncalled for.
[903a c] 4.
provisional seniority list and the statement of introduction to the compilation are no evidence of the date of merger do not reflect the decision of the govt.
of india.
