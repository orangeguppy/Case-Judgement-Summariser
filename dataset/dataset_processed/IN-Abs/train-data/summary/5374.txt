consequent upon the opening of the ram janam bhumi temple at ayodhya, there was considerable agitation among the muslim community.
the petitioners and appellants were arrested for inciting the members of the community to in dulge in violence and charged for offences under sections 147/148/149/307/332 of the indian penal code.
while their bail applications were pending; the district magistrate, purporting to act under sub.s.
(3) of section 3 of the , served detention orders on them.
writ petitions challenging the detention orders filed by the appellants were rejected by the high court.
the petitioners and appellants contended that the deten tion orders were bad for the reason that there was no mate rial before the district magistrate on the basis of which he could form the opinion that they would act in future in a manner prejudicial to maintenance of public order.
allowing the petitions and appeals, this court, held: the power to detain under the act can be exercised only with a view to preventing a person from acting in a manner which may prejudice any of the considerations set forth in section 3 thereof.
preventive detention is not intended as a punitive measure, as a curtailment of liberty by way of punishment for an offence already committed.
no doubt the satisfaction of the district magistrate making the detention order is subjective in nature, but, even subjec tive satisfaction, must be based upon some pertinent materi al.
[473f g; 474a b] in this case there is no material to show that the detenus would act 472 in the future to the prejudice of the maintenance of public order.
even if it is accepted that the detenus did address the assembly of persons and incited them to lawlessness, there is no material to warrant the inference that they would repeat the misconduct or do anything else which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
