(ii)the definition of "machinery" given by the privy council in the case of corporation of calcutta vs chairman, cossipore and chitpore municipality (1922) l.r. 48 i.a. 435, is applicable, and according to that definition a diesel engine is clearly "machinery".
and when an engine is fixed in a vehicle it is installed within the meaning of the expression in cls.
(vi) and (via).
per shah, j. (dissenting) replacement of a petrol engine by a new diesel engine in a motor car cannot be said to be installation of machinery.
to be installed, the machinery must for the purpose of the business be brought into service as a self contained unit, and it would be difficult to regard the introduction of a mere part, which has no independent use in the business conducted by the assesses, as machinery installed for the purpose of the second para of cl.
(vi) of section 10 (2).
