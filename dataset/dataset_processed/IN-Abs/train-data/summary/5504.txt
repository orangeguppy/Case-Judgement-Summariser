on march 23, 1979, the respondent no. 1 filed an application (in case no. 53 of 1978) for substitution of the legal heirs of the deceased tenant, along with an application under section 5 of the limitation act.
the prescribed authority rejected the application for substitution on grounds of delay.
on december 11, 1979, the respondent no. 1 moved a second application under section 21(1)(a), read with section 43(2)(rr) of the new act (on the ground as in his earlier application), which was registered as case no. 68 of 1979.

the trial court dismissed the suit.
the high court was then moved for relief by a writ petition against the orders of the prescribed authority for eviction and the order of the additional district judge.
the writ petition was dismissed, followed by the dismissal of a review petition too.
aggrieved thereby the appellant has appealed to this court by special leave.
dismissing the appeal, the court, ^ held: the questions involved in the appeal are: firstly, in view of the provisions of section 43(2)(rr), was the high court right in its decision, in the facts and circumstances of the case, specially the factum of the death of the (original) tenant being alleged, and in view of the fact that the execution of the order for eviction had become final before the new act came into operation? secondly, how far do the subsequent events, namely, the agreements by the respondent no. 1 with the wife of one of the sons of the tenant and with the kanodias to sell the property in dispute, demolish or destroy the case of a bona fide need of the landlord? [622g h; 623a] in substance, the need was there of the landlord for his occupation of his premises as he wanted to reside in his house after his retirement from government service, and for this purpose he had sought eviction and obtained the order of eviction prior to the coming into operation of the new act.
the object of the landlord was not defeated by the provisions of the new act.
[626g h] considering the subsequent events, namely, the refusal of permission by the urban ceiling authorities, the escalation of building cost (upto 1987), failure on the part of the vendee to register and execute the document, it is not possible to hold that the subsequent events have so materially altered the position as to defeat the original order for possession passed in favour of the landlord.
the subsequent events do not in 619 any way affect the existence of the need of the landlord for possession of premises in question.
[627c e] there was no failure on the part of the landlord to take steps for the substitution.
nothing was proved before the court that the agreements with r.p. kanodia and p.k. kanodia were valid today or given effect to in view of the provision of the land ceiling act.
it was not proved to the satisfaction of the authorities below that any agreement to sell the premises to kanodias had been given effect to and acted upon and in that view of the matter, the need of the landlord indubitably succeeds, and any allegations made do not merit any revision of the order which had become final.
finality of the judicial decisions is one of the essential ingredients upon which the administration of justice must rest.
in that view of the matter, even if the contentions advanced on behalf of the respondents are taken into consideration and a new look is taken because of the subsequent events, which cannot be done in view of the specific provisions in clause (rr) of section 43(2) of the new act, the appellant has no case.
the high court was right in not interfering with the order of the prescribed authority.
finality of the decisions of the authorities under the act has to be given due reverence and place in the judicial administration.
[629a c] the appeal fails.
as the appellant had been staying in the premises for quite some time, time till april 30, 1988 granted to him to deliver vacant possession of the house to the landlord, subject to his filing usual undertaking within four weeks.
