under the u.p. higher judicial service rules, 1953 appointments to the posts of civil and sessions judges were made by promotion from the members of the u.p. civil service (judicial branch) and by direct rccruitment.
rule 20 of the rules dealing with seniority provided that seniority in each of the two classes of posts shall be determined by the date of confirmation in that class of post.
rule 23 provided that a probationer shall be confirmed in his appointment at the end of his period of probation if the governor was satisfied that he was fit for confirmation.
the appellant who was appointed as a civil judge in 1955, was promoted as officiating civil and sessions judge in july, 1960.
respondents 3 to 5 who were direct recruits to the post of civil and sessions judges joined service in may/june, 1966.
for the purpose of absorbing the promoted officers the government converted 22 temporary posts into permanent posts of civil and sessions judges with effect from april 1, 1966.
three out of those posts were given to the three respondents, who were direct recruits, and they were confirmed in the posts with effect from may/june, 1968.
in twelve other posts, twelve promotees were confirmed with effect from april 1, 1966, but the appellant was not so confirmed though he had been continuously officiating as a civil and sessions judge since july, 1960.
he was confirmed as civil and sessions judge with effect from january 1, 1969.
he was eventually confirmed in the post of district and sessions judge with effect from february 1, 1973.
the three respondents were later appointed as district and sessions judges.
by a notification dated march 19, 1975, they were confirmed in those posts with effect from july/august, 1972.
the notification dated july 22, 1977 issued by the high court, showed the three respondents at serial nos. 31 and 32 of the list and the appellant at no.38 and the dates of confirmation were shown as august 25, 1972 in respect of three respondents and march 18, 1973 in respect of the appellant.
the high court allowed the appellant 's writ petition and quashed the notifications dated march 19, 1975 and july 22, 1971 insofar as they related to the dates of confirmation of the appellant and the respondents.
the high court on the administrative side was directed to redetermine the dates of their confirmation as district and sessions judges and their inter se seniority in accordance with rule 20. 83 in appeal it was, inter alia, contended on behalf of the appellant that the 22 permanent posts having been created with effect from 1 4 1966 for permanent absorption of promotees who had been officiating prior to that date four a period of more than three years, (respondents 3 to s who were not even in service on that date, could not be absorbed against any of those vacancies, and the appellant who had put in nearly six years of service in the cadre on the date when the three respondents were appointed, could not be denied confirmation with effect from april 1, 1966; that apart from greater length of service, the appellant has an excellant, unblemished record of service; and in the circumstances, the confirmation of the appellant with effect from date later than those assigned to respondents 3, 4 and s is unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.
allowing the appeal, ^ held: the main criteria to be considered for confirmation of officers officiating in the higher judicial service of the state are: (i) availability of a substantive vacancy/post.
(ii) suitability for the post.
[92c] here, a substantive post of civil and sessions judge was available to the appellant from april 1, 1966, when respondents 3, 4 and 5 had not even been appointed to the service in any capacity.
by april 1, 1966, the appellant had put in service as officiating civil and sessions judge for a period exceeding 5 years and 9 months.
there is nothing on record to suggest that by or on april 1, 1966, he was not suitable for confirmation as civil and sessions judge, or later, as district and sessions judge when a post in that grade became available to him.
in the circumstances, the impugned notification dated march 19, 1975 issued by the government, inasmuch as it did not accord to the appellant the same treatment which had been meted out to twelve other promoted officers who were confirmed with effect from april 1, 1966, is not based on any intelligible.
differentia or reasonable principle, and as such, cannot be sustained.
the same comments apply mutatis mutandis to the impugned notification, dated july 22, 1977, issued by the high court.
once it is found that the notification dated march 19, 1975 cannot be sustained, the foundation for fixing the dates of confirmation and determining relative seniority of district and sessions judges will also crumble.
[92d g] the entire matter therefore, requires reconsideration by the high court in the exercise of its powers under article 235 of the constitution.
