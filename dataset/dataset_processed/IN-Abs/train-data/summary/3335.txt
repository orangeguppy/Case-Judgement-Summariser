the petitioners were found guilty of murder by the court and sentenced to death, their petition to the president of india for commuting the death sentence was rejected, thereupon, they filed a writ petition in the high court to quash the order of the president on the ground that he had not taken into account two factors, namely, (1) the offences were 'political '; and (2) the prevailing trends against death sentence.
the high court dismissed the petition, dismissing the petition for special leave to this court.
^ held: (1) assuming that the offences are political offences, under the indian penal code, murder is murder and judges cannot re write, the law whatever their views on death sentence, as citizens, may be, and interfere where they have no jurisdiction, [75 b c; 77 h], (2) all power however majestic the dignitary wielding it may be, shall be exercised in good faith with intelligent and informed care and honestly for the public weal.
but, when the constitution has empowered the nation 's highest executive as the repository of the clemency power, the court cannot intervene and judicial review is excluded by implication.
since, the contention, in this case, that equality is denied in the matter of sentence because some get the benefit of clemency while others do not, has no foundation.
nor is there any trace of despotism involved, it is not necessary to examine in whom the remedy lies if arbitrary exercise of public power is definitely established a particular case.
[76 e h].
the rejection, however, of one clemency petition does not exhaust the power of the president or the governor.
therefore, the petitioners may urge the circumstances pressed before this court for clemency again before the president.] [77 d e].
