the respondent municipality passed a resolution under s.67(1) of the c.p. & berar municipal act, 1922, for the purpose of levying an octroi duty which was published in the state gazette along with the rules for assessment.
objections were invited to the said proposed tax, and only one objection was filed within time which was also rejected.
the government gave its sanction to the imposition of the tax and draft rules by two notifications.
the appellants filed a petition challenging the legality of the imposition of the tax inter alia on the ground that the notifications were ultra vires.
they contended that all steps necessary for the imposition of tax had not been taken and that objections raised within time by the respondent no. 1 were not considered on their merits and were rejected merely on the ground that there was only one objector; as this was one of the essential steps for the validity: of the imposition of tax it could not be said that section 67 of the act had been complied with, therefore the imposition was invalid.
held, that where the government notification clearly was one which directed imposition of octroi tax it fell within subs.
( 7) of section 67 of the act and having been once notified in the gazette sub section
(8) of section 67 of the act came into operation and the issue of the notification was conclusive evidence of the tax having been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the act, and it could not be challenged on the ground that all necessary steps had rot been taken.
