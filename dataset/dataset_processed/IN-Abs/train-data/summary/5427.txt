vs municipal corporation delhi & ors., this court while laying down principles for determination of rateable value for making assessment of property tax of premises constructed in stages in delhi, emphasised that "the formula set out in sub sections
(1)(a)(2)(b) and (1)(b)(2)(b) of section 6 of the delhi municipal corporation act, 1957 cannot be applied for determining the standard rent of an addition, as if that addition was the only structure standing on the land.
the assessing authori ties cannot determine the standard rent of additional struc ture by taking the reasonable cost of construction of the additional structure and adding to it the market price of the land and applying the statutory percentage of to the aggregate amount.
" the petitioner society and the municipal corporation in their applications to this court sought clarification of the above observations.
dismissing the applications, held: the matter has been categorically decided and there is absolutely no ambiguity which requires clarifica tion.
when at a different stage, additional construction is raised on the property already valued, the market value of the land is not to be taken into account as it has already been considered while fixing the valuation of the preexist ing construction.
