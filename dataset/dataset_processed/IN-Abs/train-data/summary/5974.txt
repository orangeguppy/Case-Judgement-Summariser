respondent owners ' suit for recovery of arrears of rent was decreed ex parte when the appellant tenant failed to appear in the suit; however, on a subsequent application made by him the decree was set aside on 24.3.1977.
the appellant made a deposit of rs.2,912 on 30.5.1977 stating that the said date was the first date of hearing in the suit.
the appellant, who had first stated that he was not obliged to deposit the entire arrears as they were barred by time, later on prayed for amendment of his pleadings and sought to deposit the time barred arrears on 29.9.1977, but the deposit was actually made on 1.10.1977.
the court al lowed the prayer for amendment but the additional district judge held that the appellant was liable to be evicted from the premises since he had failed to deposit the entire arrears on or before 30.8.1977 which was the date of first hearing in the suit in terms of section 20(4) of the u.p. urban buildings (regulation of letting, rent and eviction) act, 1972.
the appellant 's writ petition challenging the afore said finding was dismissed by the high court.
dismissing the appeal, held: as the suit was in the nature of a small cause suit, and as the provincial small causes courts act did not contemplate the fixation of any date for settlement of issues, it must be taken that 30.8.1977 was the date of first hearing in the suit, and inasmuch as the entire amount due as arrears of rent had not been deposited within time, the high court was right in dismissing the writ petition.
