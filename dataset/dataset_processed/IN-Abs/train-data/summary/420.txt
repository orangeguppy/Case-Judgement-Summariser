during the pendency of an appeal before the labour appellate tribunal in respect of a prior industrial dispute between the same parties the management laid off certain workmen and offered to pay compensation equal to half the basic wages and dearness allowance for the first 45 days in accordance with the provisions of proviso (a) to section 25 c, industrial disputes act.
the workmen made an application to the tribunal under section 23 of the industrial disputes (appellate tribunal) act, 1950 alleging that there was a breach of section 22(a) of the same act, and that the lay off was not bona fide and claimed full wages for the entire period of the lay off as compensation.
the tribunal held that the lay off was justified but that the workmen were entitled to half the basic wages and dearness allowance not merely for the first 45 days but for the entire period under proviso (b) to section 25 c. held, that on the finding of the tribunal that the lay off wag justified the application under section 23 was liable to be dismissed.
proviso (b) to section 25 c, industrial disputes act, is only applicable in case of a second and distinct lay off and does not apply to a period subsequent to the first 45 days of one continuous lay off.
