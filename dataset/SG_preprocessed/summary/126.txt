supreme court of singapore18 october 2023case summaryascentra holdings, inc (in official liquidation) and others v spgk pte ltd [2023] sgca 32 court of appeal – civil appeal no 23 of 2022 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon):outcome: the court of appeal allows an appeal against the decision of the general division of the high court, holding that a voluntary liquidation concerning a solvent company qualifies as a “foreign proceeding” for the purpose of recognition under singapore’s adapted enactment of the model law on cross-border insolvency developed by the united nations commission on international trade law (the “sg model law”).pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  the court of appeal held that there is no requirement under the sg model law for a company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress before a proceeding concerning that company may be recognised as a foreign proceeding under art 17 and art 2(h) of the sg model law. accordingly, the requirement that a proceeding be conducted “under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt” within the meaning of art 2(h) of the sg model law will be satisfied as long as the law or the relevant part of the law under which the relevant proceeding is conducted includes provisions dealing with the insolvency of a company or the adjustment of its debts: at [98]-–[99].background to the appeal and the material facts 1 the first appellant (“ascentra”) sold health and beauty products and computer communications software in hong kong, taiwan and singapore prior to its liquidation. the second and third appellants are the joint official liquidators of ascentra (the “liquidators”) appointed by the grand court of the cayman islands (the “cayman grand court”). the respondent is a company incorporated in singapore. the appellants allege that the respondent’s parent company, shang peng gao ke, inc, owes certain sums of money to ascentra, some of which is held by the respondent and another singapore-incorporated company. 2 ascentra’s shareholders resolved to place it in voluntary liquidation on 1 june 2021. as ascentra’s directors failed to file a declaration of solvency within 28 days after the commencement of the voluntary liquidation as required under cayman law, the second appellant presented a petition to the cayman grand court on 2 july 2021 for the liquidation to proceed under court supervision. on 17 september 2021, the cayman grand court allowed the petition and appointed the liquidators as joint official liquidators of ascentra. on 23 september 2021, the liquidators filed a certificate in the cayman grand court stating their determination that ascentra should be treated as solvent. the same was stated in a letter dated 14 october 2021 addressed to ascentra’s shareholders. 3 on 6 january 2022, the appellants filed hc/os 16/2022 pursuant to art 15 of the third schedule to the insolvency, restructuring and dissolution act 2018 (2020 rev ed) (the “sg model law” and the “irda” respectively). the sg model law is singapore’s adapted enactment of the model law on cross-border insolvency developed by the united nations commission on international trade law (the “uncitral model law”).4 the appellants sought: (a) an order recognising ascentra’s liquidation in the cayman islands (“ascentra’s cayman liquidation”) in singapore as a foreign main proceeding within the meaning of art 2(f) of the sg model law; (b) an order recognising the liquidators as “foreign representatives” of ascentra within the meaning of art 2(i) of the sg model law; and (c) an order granting he liquidators such powers in relation to ascentra’s property and assets as are available under singapore insolvency law. 5 the high court judge below (the “judge”) interpreted the words “under a law relating to insolvency” in art 2(h) of the sg model law as referring to a body of rules, whether statutory or judge-made, which governs a company that is insolvent. the judge accordingly found that ascentra’s cayman liquidation is not a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of art 2(h) of the sg model law, because the legislative “track” under which ascentra’s liquidation was commenced does not and cannot apply to a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress. decision on appeal6 pursuant to art 17(1) of the sg model law, a proceeding must be recognised if it is a foreign proceeding within the meaning of art 2(h). the following issues arose in the appeal: (a) whether ascentra’s cayman liquidation is being conducted under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt; (b) whether ascentra’s cayman liquidation is a collective proceeding; (c) whether ascentra’s cayman liquidatioon is being conducted for the purpose of liquidation or reorganisation; and (d) whether the singapore courts have jurisdiction to recognise ascentra’s cayman liquidation: at [27]–[31]. whether ascentra’s cayman liquidation is being conducted under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt 7 the words “under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt” should be interpreted as a collective whole. the judge and the parties dealt, in considerable detail, with the question of whether the phrase “law relating to insolvency” in art 2(h) of the sg model law refers narrowly to the specific provision(s) under which the foreign proceeding is conducted (the “narrow approach) or more broadly to the statutory regime or part of the relevant legislation containing those specific provision(s) in addition to others (the “broad approach”). in practical terms, the difference between the two approaches may be reduced to a more fundamental inquiry, that is, whether the singapore parliament intended that the words “under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt” should be limited to laws that are applicable only to companies that are insolvent or in severe financial distress: at [32]–[34]. whether the scope of art 2(h) extends to solvent companies8 art 2(h) under the sg model law is drafted broadly, with no express requirement for a company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress for a proceeding involving that company to be recognised as a foreign proceeding: at [37].9 when parliament adopted the uncitral model law as the sg model law, it added the words “or adjustment of debt” to the definition of “foreign proceeding” in art 2(h) from s 101(23) of the bankruptcy code 11 usc (us) (1978) (the “us bankruptcy code”). these words appear in chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code, the purpose of which is to preserve going concerns and to restructure a business’s finances: at [39]–[40]. 10 the words “or adjustment of debt” were included in art 2(h) of the sg model law to enable the singapore courts to recognise: (a) proceedings in foreign jurisdictions that are akin to schemes of arrangement commenced under singapore law and/or reorganisations commenced under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code; and (b) proceedings recognisable under chapter 15 of the us bankruptcy code (which sets out the adaptation of the uncitral model law of the united states (the “us”)). neither of these categories of proceedings requires the subject company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress as a prerequisite for commencement. it may thus be inferred that the addition of the words “or adjustment of debt” to the definition of “foreign proceeding” in art 2(h) was meant to empower the singapore courts to recognise under the sg model law proceedings concerning a company that were conducted under a foreign law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt, even if that company was solvent: at [41]–[46].11 the judge fell into error in interpreting the art 2(h) of the sg model law with reference to extraneous material that did not consider the significance of the words “adjustment of debt”: at [47].12 that art 2(h) was intended to include solvent companies in its ambit is consistent with the presumption of insolvency under art 31 of the sg model law, which would otherwise be largely superfluous: at [48].13 a purposive interpretation of art 2(h) does not lead to the judge’s conclusion, as the addition of the words “or adjustment of debt” positively suggests a parliamentary object to extend the sg model law to proceedings concerning solvent companies. further, while the primary object of the sg model law is to lay down a framework for the co-ordinated cross-border management of proceedings involving insolvent companies, it would not be contrary to or undermine that object by extending the sg model law to proceedings concerning solvent companies: at [49]–[54].whether solvent companies are excluded under the uncitral model law 14 the upshot of the extraneous material relied upon by the judge (including preparatory material pertaining to the uncitral model law and guides to interpretation) is that the uncitral model law was originally intended by its drafters to be focused primarily on companies that are either insolvent or in severe financial distress. however, the extraneous material does not go so far as to suggest that construing the ambit of the uncitral model law as including solvent companies would undermine the purpose of the uncitral model law. on the contrary, interpreting art 2(h) of the sg model law as encompassing solvent proceedings within its ambit is consistent with the overall purpose of the uncitral model law: at [55]–[66].the prevailing approach to the interpretation of the uncitral model law15 the interpretation of article 2(h) in singapore should be broadly harmonious with the approaches taken in other jurisdictions. the broad approach is aligned with the position in the us, the united kingdom (with the exception of re sturgeon central asia balanced fund ltd (in liquidation) (no 2); carter v bailey and another (as foreign representatives of sturgeon central asia balanced fund ltd) [2020] ewhc 123 (ch) (“re sturgeon”)), australia and new zealand. although the leading case in the us has attracted a degree of criticism from academics and in re sturgeon, those do not warrant departing from the broad approach: at [69], [71]–[81], [83]–[92].practical concerns 16 the concern that any type of proceeding, no matter how disconnected it may be from insolvency, may be brought into the ambit of art 2(h) of the sg model law is somewhat overstated given that there are at least five criteria that must be met for a proceeding to come within art 2(h): at [94].17 the risk of applicants abusing the recognition regime to obtain moratoriums in respect of solvent companies is overstated as the court may recognise a foreign proceeding as a foreign main proceeding without an accompanying moratorium necessarily being maintained pursuant to art 20(6) of the sg model law on the contrary, imposing a requirement that the subject company must either be insolvent or in severe financial distress may introduce an undesirable measure of uncertainty at the recognition stage: at [96]–[97]. conclusion on the first issue 18 there is no requirement under the sg model law for a company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress before a proceeding concerning that company may be recognised as a foreign proceeding, and the broad approach should thus be adopted in singapore. applying the broad approach, ascentra’s cayman liquidation is a proceeding being conducted under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt. the provisions under which ascentra’s cayman liquidation is being conducted are contained within part v of the cayman act, which contains other provisions dealing with insolvency or adjustment of debt. the cayman act also contains provisions dealing with arrangements and reconstructions: at [98] and [101].whether ascentra’s cayman liquidation is a collective proceeding 19 ascentra’s cayman liquidation is a collective proceeding within the meaning of art 2(h) of the sg model law as it is subject to various provisions in the cayman act that are concerned generally with the rights of all of ascentra’s creditors: at [104]–[107]. whether ascentra’s cayman liquidation is being conducted for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation  20 the respondent’s argument that the word “liquidation” in art 2(h) of the sg model law should be interpreted as being limited to insolvent liquidations is incompatible with the court’s conclusion. ascentra’s cayman liquidation was conducted for the purpose of liquidation within the meaning of art 2(h) of the sg model law: at [109] and [111].whether the singapore courts have jurisdiction to recognise ascentra’s cayman liquidation  21 the singapore courts have jurisdiction to recognise ascentra’s cayman liquidation pursuant to art 4(2)(a)(ii) of the sg model law as ascentra has property situated in singapore in the form of shares in a singapore-incorporated company, which the respondent does not dispute: at [113].conclusion22 as ascentra’s cayman liquidation qualifies as a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of art 2(h) of the sg model law, and the singapore courts have jurisdiction to recognise ascentra’s cayman liquidation, the requirements for recognition under art 17 of the sg model law are satisfied. the court is thus obliged to recognise ascentra’s cayman liquidation as a foreign main proceeding in singapore: at [114]–[115].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
