plaintiff situation: at [30].•  where a lis alibi pendens arises in the context of a common plaintiff situation, the burden of proof shifts from the applicant to the respondent to prove that the foreign proceedings are not vexatious or oppressive: at [56] to [58].background to the dispute1 the present dispute arose out of a joint venture between pt kib and obpl to develop an integrated commercial and residential project in batam, indonesia (the “batam project”).2 the batam project is carried out through a joint venture company, pt oxley karya indo batam (“pt okib”), in which pt kib and obpl were equal shareholders.3 pt kib is a company incorporated in indonesia and has as its principal business real estate development.4 obpl is a company incorporated in singapore and also deals with real estate development.5 the terms of the joint venture are embodied in a number of agreements, including a shareholders’ agreement (the “sha”) and a joint operation agreement (the “joa”) between pt kib and obpl.6 at the time of application, pt kib has commenced four actions relating to the dispute over the batam project.7 on 3 february 2020, pt kib commenced the present action, suit 104 (the “singapore action”), against obpl and various other related parties.8 on 27 august 2020, pt kib commenced an action against pt okib in the batam district court (the “1st batam action”). parties reached a settlement on 9 september and this action was not in issue in the present application.9 on 21 september 2020, pt kib commenced an action against obpl and pt okib in the batam district court (the “2nd batam action”).10 on the next day, pt kib commenced an action against obpl and various other related parties in the central jakarta district court (the “jakarta action”).11 obpl brought the present application to restrain pt kib from pursuing the 2nd batam action and the jakarta action (collectively the “indonesian actions”), and from commencing or pursuing any other actions in any jurisdiction against the defendants of suit 104, including their present or former agents and employees, in relation to the batam project.the court’s decision12 the law governing the granting of anti-suit injunctions is set out in the case of lakshmi anil salgaocar v jhaveri darsan jitendra [2019] 2 slr 372 (“lakshmi”): at [17]. in that case, the court of appeal identified five factors that are relevant in determining whether to grant an anti-suit injunction:a. whether the injunction respondent is amenable to the jurisdiction of the singapore court;b. the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;c. the alleged vexation or oppression to the injunction claimant if the foreign proceedings are to continue;d. the alleged injustice to the injunction respondent as an injunction would deprive it of the advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; ande. whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties.13 the main issue in the present dispute concerned whether the indonesian actions were vexatious or oppressive to the applicant: at [19] and [25]. the respondent also submitted that (a) it would be a breach of comity to grant the anti-suit injunction and (b) the applicant made the application in bad faith: at [25].14 since lakshmi is well-settled law, the respondent’s submissions regarding the granting of injunctions under the principles set out in american cyanamid co v ethicon ltd [1975] ac 396 were irrelevant: at [21].15 the court observed that, even if entities that are party to the indonesian actions but not the singapore action or the present application would benefit by an anti-suit injunction directed against the respondent, it does not follow that the applicant has no locus standi to apply for that anti-suit injunction. an anti-suit injunction is granted on the basis of the applicant’s own legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the proceedings in singapore: at [24].duplicitous proceedings16 a lis alibi pendens properly refers to simultaneous actions pending in the local court and in a foreign country between the same parties and involving the same or similar issues, so this term connotes a duplicity of proceedings and not a mere multiplicity of proceedings: at [28].17 the presence of a lis alibi pendens was relevant to the inquiry of whether the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive to the applicant: at [29].18 a lis alibi pendens may arise in two types of factual situations: first, where the same plaintiff sues the same defendant in singapore and abroad; and second, where the plaintiff sues the defendant in singapore and the defendant sues the plaintiff abroad, or vice versa. the former is known as a “common plaintiff situation” and the latter is known as “reversed parties” situation: at [30].19 in determining whether a lis alibi pendens was present on the facts, the court had regard to the parties, causes of actions and reliefs sought by pt kib and examined whether the issues in the three actions were similar: at [33].20 in respect of the 2nd batam action, the court found that it was a subset of the singapore action: at [36] to [38]. the sole issue in that action featured in both that action and the singapore action. the difference in parties across both actions did not meaningfully differentiate them. also, since the relief sought in the 2nd batam action, while different, could have been obtained in singapore, the court inferred that the respondent deliberately chose not to do so in order to seek different reliefs across different fora.21 in respect of the jakarta action, the court also found that it was, in substance, a subset of the singapore action: at [39] to [45]. the court found that all the issues, save one, have already been raised in the singapore action. moreover, the sole issue that was not raised in the singapore action could have been pleaded there. next, it was immaterial that some causes of action relating to the same issues were different across the two actions, as the relevant inquiry was whether the issues were duplicated. further, the involvement of other parties in the jakarta action but not in the singapore action was also immaterial as no relief was sought against these parties. lastly, it was not the case that the reliefs sought in the jakarta action could only be granted by the court there. the only relief that possibly could only be granted in the jakarta action was that of criminal penalties, but in the absence of expert evidence, the court could not determine if this was indeed the case.22 hence, the court found that the present facts showed a clear case of duplicity: at [46].burden of proof23 because the applicant has shown that the indonesian actions are duplicitous, the issue of whether the burden of proving that they are vexatious or oppressive remains with the applicant arises: at [47].24 in general, the applicant should bear the burden of proving that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive: at [48].25 in virsagi management (s) pte ltd v welltech construction pte ltd and another appeal [2013] 4 slr 1097 (“virsagi”), the court of appeal stated that in the context of the doctrine of forum election, where there is a lis alibi pendens in a common plaintiff situation, the court will generally compel the plaintiff to make an election between the local and foreign proceedings, unless the circumstances are “very unusual”. in other words, the burden shifts to the common plaintiff to justify the continuation of proceedings by showing very unusual circumstances, however, the court expressly left the position open as to whether the burden of proving that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive can shift to the common plaintiff where a lis alibi pendens is shown in the context of granting an anti-suit injunction: at [49] to [51].26 the court found that there was no reason for a disparity between the law on granting anti-suit injunctions and that on forum election where there is both (a) a lis alibi pendens and (b) a common plaintiff situation. the common plaintiff situation carries the same undesirable consequences in both legal contexts, viz, the wasting of judicial resources and the risk of conflicting decisions. the law on anti-suit injunctions should thus prevent these consequences from occurring. hence, the court held that in an application for an anti-suit injunction, where the applicant can show the existence of a lis alibi pendens, the burden of proof would shift to the respondent to prove the existence of very unusual circumstances showing that the concurrent proceedings are not vexatious or oppressive: at [54] to [57].would granting the anti-suit injunction breach comity?27 the respondent submitted that the granting of an anti-suit injunction would lead to a breach of comity because it would prevent the indonesian courts from first deciding whether the indonesian actions ought to be stayed: at [60].28 in lakshmi, the court of appeal held that even where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, it would not invariably be a breach of comity for the domestic court to grant an anti-suit injunction if it finds that (a) it is clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute and (b) the injunction respondent has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceedings. these two factors were satisfied on the facts. moreover, since the applicant has not even been served in the indonesian actions, the indonesian courts have not even had the chance to decide on whether to stay the proceedings in respect of the two actions. a fortiori, there can be no breach of comity: at [62].29 the court therefore found that there was no breach of comity in granting the anti-suit injunction: at [64].did obpl make this application in bad faith?30 on 17 november 2020, the applicant filed a request with the batam city land office (“bclo”) to temporarily block the land forming the subject of the batam project (the “request”). this request was rejected: at [65].31 the respondent submitted that the request was an injunction application or was tantamount to one. as such, the request showed that the applicant has submitted to the jurisdiction of the indonesian courts. it thus claimed that the application for the anti-suit injunction was made in bad faith: at [66].32 the respondent also submitted that by not disclosing this alleged injunction application to the court, the applicant has breached a purported duty of full and frank disclosure to the court: at [67].33 having examined the expert evidence, the court found that the request was neither an injunction application nor equivalent to one. the request was an administrative action undertaken by the bclo, which does not adjudicate or otherwise make any determination on the merits of the dispute. also, the procedures for obtaining an injunction in an indonesian court are different from that pertaining to the request: at [69].34 since the present application for an anti-suit injunction was not made on an ex parte basis, the applicant therefore did not bear a duty of full and frank disclosure: at [70].35 the court therefore held that obpl did not make the present application in bad faith: at [71].conclusion36 the court allowed obpl’s application for an anti-suit injunction and ordered that the respondent was to withdraw and be restrained from pursuing the indonesian actions: at [72].37 the court was not satisfied that indemnity costs should be awarded in the present circumstances and ordered fixed costs of $17,000 to obpl, inclusive of disbursements: at [73].38 the court also declined to order a stay of execution pending an appeal. at the time of decision, it was likely that obpl would be served with the originating process for the indonesian actions, so a stay of execution would deprive it of the benefits sought under this anti-suit injunction: at [74].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not
