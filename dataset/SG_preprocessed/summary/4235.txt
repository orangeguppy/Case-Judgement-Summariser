____________________________________________________________________
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh

menon)

 


the court of appeal dismisses applications to admit further evidence on

appeal that the applicant claimed went towards showing that the respondent

had prevailed in earlier arbitration proceedings by committing fraud and

perjury.



background to the applications



1 court of appeal summonses nos 132 and 133 of 2017 (“sum 132” and “sum

133” respectively) were applications brought by bnx to adduce further

evidence in civil appeals nos 61 and 62 of 2017 (“ca 61” and “ca 62”

respectively), which were appeals brought against the decision of the high

court judge (“the judge”) in bnx v boe and another matter [2017]

sghc 289 to: (a) dismiss an application brought by bnx in originating

summons no 871 of 2016 (“os 871”) to set aside an award rendered in favour

of boe in domestic arbitration proceedings commenced by bnx against boe

(“the award”); and (b) grant an application by boe in summons no 5305 of

2016 (“sum 5305”) to strike out suit no 1097 of 2016 (“suit 1097”), which

was a suit commenced by bnx against boe.




2 the evidence that bnx sought to introduce on appeal comprised: (a)

correspondence in may 2013 between boe, the architectural firm hired by boe

(referred to as “[a]”), and the urban redevelopment authority (“the ura”),

which bnx alleged that boe had wrongfully withheld during the arbitration

proceedings (“the may 2013 documents”); and (b) the pleadings and some

correspondence from a suit commenced by bnx against [a] (ie, suit

no 585 of 2017 (“suit 585”)), which bnx claimed would show that boe’s

witnesses had given false evidence in the arbitration proceedings (“the

suit 585 documents”). bnx also sought, by sum 132 and sum 133, leave to

adduce affidavits from the individuals whom bnx alleged were involved in

withholding the correspondence and leave for both parties to cross-examine

those individuals.



the material facts



3 the dispute stemmed from an agreement for boe to sell a hotel in

singapore to bnx in 2013. the hotel was located on a plot of land (“the

development”) that was subject to gross floor area (“gfa”) requirements

issued by the ura, which entailed certain predetermined percentages of the

gfa being allocated as either for hotel use or office space. facilities

that did not fall within the core understanding of hotel use could be

deemed to be for hotel use only if they were for the sole and exclusive use

of guests and staff of the hotel.




4 during the construction of the development from 2010 to 2013, the ura

periodically issued grants of written permission (“gwp”) that set out those

use restrictions. boe engaged [a] as its project architect to discuss with

the ura as to how boe should ensure that the development fell within those

use restrictions. on ura’s request, boe gave the ura written undertakings

in october 2010, march 2013 and may 2013 regarding the restriction of

certain facilities within the development (“the relevant facilities”) for

the exclusive use of hotel guests and staff (respectively, “the october

2010 undertaking”, “the march 2013 undertaking” and “the may 2013

undertaking”).




5 prior to the sale of the development, boe arranged for bnx to have access

to all relevant materials in order for bnx to undertake the necessary due

diligence review. boe established a “virtual data room”, which contained

soft copies of all the relevant key documents, and a “physical data room”,

which was a room containing all the drawings and correspondence relating to

the development. the october 2010 undertaking and the march 2013

undertaking could be found in only the physical data room, while the may

2013 undertaking was included in neither the physical nor the virtual data

room. although bnx’s solicitors and consultants drew bnx’s attention to

potential issues regarding the gfa requirements for the development, bnx

did not follow up on that advice.




6 the sale was completed in december 2013. bnx and boe entered into a lease

agreement in february 2014 in order to effect the sale of the development.

in july 2014, bnx first became aware of the use restrictions. bnx accused

boe of wrongfully failing to disclose the use restrictions during their

negotiations. boe denied the accusations.




7 bnx commenced domestic arbitration proceedings against boe in october

2014, alleging that boe had fraudulently misrepresented that there were no

use restrictions over the relevant facilities, such that boe was liable

for, amongst other things, fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of

contract. during document production, boe offered to disclose all hard copy

correspondence in its possession between [a] and the ura pertaining to the

use restrictions, including the october 2010 undertaking and the march 2013

undertaking (but not the may 2013 undertaking). in the award issued by the

arbitral tribunal, all of bnx’s claims were dismissed.




8 in august 2016, bnx commenced os 871, seeking to set aside the award

pursuant to s 48 of the arbitration act (cap 10, 2002 rev ed). the judge

dismissed os 871 in march 2017, and ca 61 was an appeal against this. in

october 2016, bnx commenced suit 1097, seeking to rescind the lease

agreement that boe had granted bnx. in november 2016, boe filed sum 5305 to

strike out suit 1097. the judge struck out bnx’s claims in suit 1097 in

march 2017, and ca 62 was an appeal against this. in june 2017, bnx

commenced suit 585 against [a], claiming that [a], as boe’s architect, had

breached its duty of care to bnx, a buyer of the development, to advise boe

with reasonable care and skill. [a] made references to the may 2013

documents in its defence filed in suit 585. in november 2017, bnx brought

the applications in sum 132 and sum 133, seeking to adduce further evidence

in support of its appeals in ca 61 and ca 62.



the court’s decision



9 the court of appeal dismissed the applications in sum 132 and sum 133 to

adduce further evidence on appeal in ca 61 and ca 62. (    [61], [107])




10 the may 2013 documents should not be adduced as further evidence on

appeal for two main reasons. first, bnx, having obtained the may 2013

documents in the course of discovery in suit 585, was subject to an implied

undertaking not to use them for any purpose other than the determination of

suit 585 (“the riddick principle”). the riddick principle

applied because the suit 585 documents had not been disclosed by boe

voluntarily. it was incumbent on bnx to first apply to the court presiding

over suit 585 to be released from its implied undertaking, but it did not

do so. ([63]–[71])




11 second, bnx failed to show that “special grounds” existed to admit the

may 2013 documents as further evidence on appeal, as required under s 37(4)

of the supreme court of judicature act (cap 322, 2007 rev ed) (“the scja”)

and o 57 r 13(2) of the rules of court (cap 322, r 5, 2014 rev ed) (“the

roc”). bnx had to satisfy the three cumulative conditions laid down in    ladd v marshall [1954] 1 wlr 1489 (“ladd v marshall”),

which are that (a) the evidence could not have been obtained with

reasonable diligence for use in the lower court (non-availability); (b) the

evidence would probably have an important influence on the result of the

case, although it need not be decisive (relevance and materiality); and (c)

the evidence must be apparently credible, although it need not be

incontrovertible (credibility or reliability).(    [1], [73], [74])




12 the first ladd v marshall requirement (ie,

non-availability) was not met because the may 2013 documents could have

been obtained with reasonable diligence for use during the arbitration and

the post-award proceedings. bnx failed to take the necessary steps to seek

direct evidence from [a] during the arbitration. also, the first    ladd v marshall requirement could not be relaxed or waived because

the bnx had not shown that boe had perpetrated a fraud by deliberately

withholding the may 2013 documents, much less fraud that struck at the very

root of the proceedings. further, bnx had not acted diligently during the

due diligence process preceding the sale of the development, and thereby

failed to properly inform itself of the relevant use restrictions even

though it had the means to. in any event, the second    ladd v marshall requirement (ie, relevance and

materiality) was also not met. the may 2013 documents would not have had a

material impact on the tribunal’s findings in the award or those of the

judge in the proceedings below. (    [76], [77], [82], [86]–[88], [91])




13 when a court is faced with an application to adduce further evidence of

matters that occurred after the trial or hearing that resulted in the

decision of the court below that is being appealed, the court’s principal

concern in deciding whether the further evidence would have a perceptible

impact on the decision (and hence should be admitted) is with securing the

interests of justice. hence, the balance should be struck in favour of

admitting such evidence as long as the court does the following: (a) first,

ascertain what the relevant matters are, of which evidence is sought to be

given, and ensure that these are matters that occurred after the trial or

hearing below; (b) second, satisfy itself that the evidence of these

matters is at least potentially material to the issues in the appeal; and

(c) third, satisfy itself that the material at least appears to be

credible. the court must thereafter also assess the weight to be placed on

any such evidence as is admitted. ([97], [99], [100]).




14 the suit 585 documents should not be adduced as further evidence on

appeal. although the suit 585 documents were all further material that came

into existence after the date of the judge’s decisions which are being

appealed, they did not concern matters that have occurred after the date of

the decision below. in any event, the matters to which the suit 585

documents purported to relate were also not even remotely relevant or

material to the issues that are before the court. (    [101]–[104])




15 bnx’s applications to admit the affidavits of boe’s representatives and

solicitors, [a]’s representative and bnx’s own representative, and for both

parties to be given leave to cross-examine those individuals, fall away in

the light of the court’s rejection of bnx’s application to admit the may

2013 documents and the suit 585 documents as further evidence on appeal.

they are thus also dismissed ([105], [106]).
