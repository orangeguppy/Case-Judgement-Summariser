supreme court of singapore20 september 2022case summarysais ltd and another v hardman, michael jon and another [2022] sghc(a) 32 civil appeal no. 27 of 2022--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the appellate division of the high court (delivered by justice woo bih li):outcome: the appellate division of the high court (the “court”) dismissed the appeal on all but one ground. in respect of that ground, it observed that the judge of the general division of the high court (the “judge”) had interpreted the relevant contractual provision in a manner which was internally inconsistent. that provision did not have the scope the judge suggested it did. accordingly, the court varied the judge’s order, reducing the quantum for which the first appellant was found to be liable to pay the second respondent.background 1 this appeal concerned claims for damages resulting from the non-delivery of shares of a company previously listed on the toronto stock exchange venture exchange (“tsx-v”). these shares were granted to the respondents (the plaintiffs below), mr hardman and mr finck, as part of an employee share incentive scheme called the “restricted share unit plan” (the “rsu plan”). the respondents were employees of the second appellant, kaddra pte ltd (previously, “sarment (s) pte ltd”), which was a subsidiary of the first appellant, sais limited (previously, “sarment holdings ltd”). the first appellant was the company listed on the tsx-v whose shares were being granted under the rsu plan. as a group of companies, the appellants’ primary business was the sale of wine. as the appellants’ change in names occurred during the period material to the dispute, they will be referred to as “a1” and “a2” respectively. 2 mr hardman was granted 199,619 restricted share units (“units”) on 29 march 2019, and mr finck was granted 38,260 units on 21 september 2018. units were not shares. they were simply entries on the books of a1 which denoted an employee’s entitlement to receive shares when the units “vested”. both mr hardman and mr finck’s units were scheduled to vest in three tranches. for mr hardman, his units were slated to vest as follows: (a) 66,540 on 21 august 2019; (b) 66,540 on 21 august 2020; and (c) 66,539 on 21 august 2021. for mr finck: (a) 12,753 on 21 september 2019; (b) 12,753 on 21 september 2020; and (c) 12,754 on 21 september 2021.3 once a unit “vested”, section 4.3 of the rsu plan provided that a1 was obliged to “settle” or “make payment” on those units “within [15] days of the vesting date and which date shall not, in any event, extend beyond december 15th of the third year following the year of grant for the particular [unit]”. the correct interpretation of this provision was one dispute in this appeal. 4 the other provision which formed the subject of dispute was section 5.3 of the rsu plan. this provided that, upon a “change of control” event, all units granted under the rsu plan were deemed as having “vested immediately” prior to the event, irrespective of their scheduled vesting dates, and, would also become “payable effective immediately” on the same date. saliently, “change of control” was defined in section 1.1(i) of the rsu plan as including the sale of all or substantially all of a1’s or its subsidiary’s assets, or, an individual acquiring a controlling interest in a1.5 on 29 july 2019, a1 entered into an agreement to sell the group’s wine and spirits business, housed in another of a1’s subsidiaries, sarment wines & spirits holding pte ltd (“sarment wines”). as part of this sale, one mr irwin (one of the purchasers) would acquire 53.5% of a1’s shares. the sale of the wine business was completed on 13 september 2019 and mr irwin obtained his 53.5% stake in a1 on 15 october 2019.6 prior to these events, mr finck was informed on 5 september 2019 that his employment with a2 would be terminated. mr finck expressed unhappiness with the fact that he was being terminated so shortly before 21 september 2019, the date on which his first tranche of 12,753 units were slated to vest. he requested to be allowed to retain the benefit of these units and his request was acceded to. on 6 september 2019, a2 issued a letter to mr finck which stated his termination and that 12,753 units would vest in him on 21 september 2019. however, mr finck never received the 12,753 shares relating to these 12,753 units.7 shortly after this, mr hardman was asked by the chief executive officer (“ceo”) of a1 whether he would be willing to accept shares in a1 in substitution of his cash bonus for 2018. it was admitted to mr hardman that this was necessary because a2 was short on cash. mr hardman agreed and executed an agreement on 9 december 2019 accepting 72,590 units in lieu of his cash bonus for 2018. in january 2020, mr hardman was also told that he would also be terminated for redundancy. mr hardman asked to resign on his own part and he was allowed to do so. on 29 january 2020, a2 issued a letter setting out the term of mr hardman’s resignation. this letter recorded that the 72,590 would be “issued and vesting” [sic] by the end of february 2020.8 in october 2019, mr hardman received 66,540 shares in a1 which represented one-third tranche of the units granted to him on 29 march 2019. after the sale of sarment wines and mr irwin’s acquisition of 53.5% of the stake in a1, however, mr hardman did not receive the balance two-thirds of the units granted. at the end of february 2020, he also did not receive the 72,590 shares in a1 he accepted in lieu of his 2018 cash bonus. on 19 february 2020, a1 announced that it had filed an application to be delisted from the tsx-v and its last trading day was 16 march 2020. thereafter, on 20 september 2020, a1 issued 205,669 of its shares (representing the sum of 66,540, 66,539 and 72,590) in mr hardman’s name. it did not ask mr hardman whether he was willing to accept these shares beforehand, and it was unclear whether mr hardman had accepted them. the parties’ dispute at trial9 mr hardman sued to recover two sums. first, damages he suffered from a1 failing to settle the balance 133,079 units he had been granted on 29 march 2019. he claimed that a1 was obliged to do so immediately by virtue of section 5.3 of the rsu plan, either on 13 september or 15 october 2019 as the date of a change of control event. second, his 2018 cash bonus.10 mr finck also relied on section 5.3 of the rsu plan to claim damages in respect of all 38,260 units he had been granted on 21 september 2018. in the alternative, mr finck claimed that he was entitled to damages in respect of the 12,753 units, the benefit of which he was allowed to retain by a2’s letter dated 6 september 2019. 11 the appellants did not dispute that mr hardman was entitled to receive 205,669 shares on the units he had been granted. however, they contended that, notwithstanding an earlier change of control event, a1 had complied with its obligations under the rsu plan by issuing the 205,669 shares to mr hardman on 20 september 2020. the appellants argued that section 4.3 governed the settlement of vested units even if such units were vested by virtue of section 5.3. the appellants then argued that section 4.3 allowed a1 to settle units at any time after they vest, so long as this was before the 15th of december of the third year following the year of the grant. for example, as mr hardman’s units were granted in 2019, it was the appellants’ position that a1 was entitled to settle these vested units on or before 15 december 2022. since it had done so, it was not in breach of the rsu plan. however, on appeal, a1 contended that the value of the 205,669 shares issued should be set-off against the damages claimed by mr hardman.12 as regards mr finck’s primary claim, the appellants contended that he could not rely on section 5.3 of the rsu plan as he had been terminated on 6 september 2019, before the possible change of control events. they relied on section 5.1 which provided that “any [units] granted [but] which have not become vested [units] prior to [the employee’s] termination … shall automatically and immediately terminate”. alternatively, they contended that, by accepting the 12,753 shares upon his termination, mr finck compromised any claim he had against them.13 for both mr hardman and mr finck’s claims, the appellants contended that, even if they had been obliged to provide shares upon a change of control event, mr hardman and mr finck would not have been able to monetise the shares. for this, they relied on a proviso to section 4.3 which provided that participating employees were prohibited from selling the shares they received under the rsu plan for a period of six months (the “moratorium”). this argument was significant because the price varied depending on the date of valuation.the decision below14 the judge found that the sale of sarment wines on 13 september 2019 amounted to a change of control event. further, the judge construed that, by section 5.3, a1 was obliged to settle vested units immediately. mr hardman was thus entitled to damages calculated using the price of a1’s shares on 13 september 2019, ca$2.00. in respect of this claim, mr hardman was awarded ca$266,158 (133,079 × ca$2.00).15 the judge did not allow mr hardman’s claim for his 2018 cash bonus. allowing such claim would be to ignore the fact that mr hardman had agreed to substitute such bonus for 72,590 shares on 9 december 2019. however, mr hardman was allowed to recover damages for a2’s failure to provide 72,590 a1 shares by the end of february 2020. as the price of a1’s shares at this time was ca$0.13, the judge awarded mr hardman ca$9,436.70 (72,590 × ca$0.13).16 despite the fact that mr finck had been terminated on 6 september 2019, the judge allowed his primary claim for 38,260 shares premised on section 5.3 of the rsu plan. the judge reasoned that mr finck could still rely on this provision because the agreement to sell sarment wines was entered on 29 july 2019 when mr finck was still an employee of a2. the definition of “change of control” in section 1.1(i)(ii) provided that a sale of all or substantially all of a1’s or its subsidiary’s assets could be effected by a “series of transactions”. thus, the judge found that, on 29 july 2019, section 5.3 had already been “engaged”, and, given that section 5.1 provided that its operation was subject to section 5.3, mr finck could still rely on section 5.3. on this basis, mr finck was awarded ca$76,520 (38,260 × ca$2.00). 17 the judge did not accept that mr finck had compromised any claims he had against the appellants.18 finally, the judge also found that the moratorium did not apply outside of the usual scheme of vesting and settlement. where a change of control event was concerned, it had no effect. similarly, in respect of the 72,590 units granted to mr hardman, a2 was obliged to provide them by a specified date (end february 2020) as stated in the letter dated 29 january 2020. the moratorium also did not apply.the parties’ dispute on appeal19 the appellants did not dispute that the completion of the sale of sarment wines on 13 september 2019 amounted to a change of control event which engaged section 5.3.20 however, in respect of mr hardman’s claims, the appellants’ case on appeal was essentially, to maintain their interpretation of section 4.3. that is, section 4.3 governed a1’s obligation to settle vested units, even if they vested pursuant to section 5.3, and, further, that section 4.3 allowed a1 to settle shares at any time after vesting, so long as it did so before 15 december 2022.21 as regards mr finck, the appellants argued that the judge’s interpretation of section 5.3 was erroneous. mr finck should not have been entitled to rely on section 5.3 because he had been terminated by 6 september 2019. in the alternative, it relied on its assertion that mr finck had compromised any claims it had against a1 by accepting the 12,753 shares upon his termination.22 the appellants also relied on the moratorium provision to argue that the judge should have used a different date for the valuation of the shares.the court’s decision23 the court undertook a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the rsu plan: at [16]–[42]. the court concluded that section 4.3 did not bear the meaning advanced by the appellants. instead, it obliged a1 to effect settlement on vested units within 15 days of their vesting: at [20]–[29]. the vesting dates were stated in each grant to the appellants. further, and in any event, the clear language of section 5.3 also obliged a1 to make immediate payment on units deemed vested by a change of control event. thus, even if section 4.3 operated in the manner which the appellants contended, it would have been obliged to provide mr hardman 133,079 shares on 13 september 2019: at [36]–[39].24 a1 bore the obligation of proving that mr hardman had accepted the 205,669 shares it issued on 20 september 2020. it failed to do so and, thus, it was liable for its failure to provide all 205,669 shares on time: at [69]. it was entitled to revoke or cancel the 205,669 shares issued to mr hardman. 25 as regards the 72,590 bonus units, a2’s letter dated 29 january 2020 made it clear that it was obliged to provide mr hardman with the shares by the end of february 2020. section 4.3 did not apply and, even if it did, that would only have allowed a2 an additional 15 days to effect settlement, but that was not the appellants’ case: at [74]–[76].26 accordingly, the judge’s award of damages to mr hardman, both in respect of the grant of units on 29 march 2019 and the agreement for bonus units on 9 december 2019, was affirmed: at [73] and [78].27 in respect of mr finck, the court rejected the appellants’ contention that mr finck had compromised his claims against them. there was nothing in the 6 september 2019 letter or surrounding discussions which suggested that such compromise had even been contemplated. indeed, the ceo of a1 agreed that there was no compromise: at [80].28 however, the court accepted that the judge erred in determining that section 5.3 was “engaged” on 29 july 2019 when the agreement to sell sarment wines had been entered into. this was internally inconsistent with the judge’s finding that the change of control event (ie, the completion of the sale of sarment wines) took place on 13 september 2019. the judge misinterpreted the phrase “series of transactions”, which referred to the mode by which a change of control, a single event, could be brought about. the fact that a change of control event could be brought about by a series of transactions did not mean that the change of control event itself was part of a series. the judge was also of the view that it could not have been the intention of the rsu plan that an employee could be unilaterally deprived of his entitlement by termination. this, however, was erroneous. there was nothing in the rsu plan to restrict a1 or its related companies’ right to terminate their employees and there was no suggestion that a2 had terminated mr finck’s employment in bad faith. thus, given his termination on 6 september 2019, mr finck could not rely on section 5.3: at [81]–[84].29 as the appellants did not dispute that mr finck was entitled to damages in respect of the 12,753 shares which he had been promised by a2’s letter dated 6 september 2019, the court awarded mr finck ca$25,506 (12,753 × ca$2.00). there was some lack of clarity as to whether the price of ca$2.00 on 13 september 2019 should be used given the court’s holding that section 5.3 did not apply. however, the parties were content for this date to be applied: at [89] and [92]. 30 the court also agreed with the judge that the moratorium did not apply in cases where shares are provided pursuant to section 5.3 or agreements which set out specific dates of vesting after the change of control event. mr hardman and mr finck would therefore have been entitled to monetise the shares on the dates which they were to be provided: at [70]–[72], [77] and [91].this summary is
