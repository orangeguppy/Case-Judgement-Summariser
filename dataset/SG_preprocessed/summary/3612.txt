-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



decision of the high court (delivered by judge of appeal justice steven

chong):





outcome: the high court dismissed an application by mr matthew peter

gearing qc for ad hoc admission to defend against a

setting-aside application in the context of an investor-state arbitration.

in doing so, the high court elaborated on the mandatory requirements and

the considerations in deciding whether to admit a foreign senior counsel.

in particular, the high court considered how the complexity of the issues

should feature in ad hoc admissions.



introduction
1  mr matthew peter gearing qc (“mr gearing”) is a queen’s counsel who

applied to be admitted to the singapore bar on an ad hoc

basis. mr gearing was the lead counsel for the investor in an

investor-state arbitration (“the arbitration”).

        
procedural background
2 in february 2017, an investor (“the investor”) commenced the

arbitration proceedings against a foreign state (“the state”).

shortly after, the state filed several objections contesting the

arbitral tribunal’s (“the tribunal”) jurisdiction to hear the

investor’s claims. the state’s objections pertained to alleged

non-compliance with the 2013 arbitral rules of the united nations

commission on international trade law (“the uncitral rules”) and a

bilateral treaty (“the bilateral treaty”) in relation to the

appointment of the presiding arbitrator. the state further alleged

that several provisions of the bilateral treaty precluded

overlapping claims or imposed time-bars and that the investor’s

arbitration claim was also precluded on the basis of an exclusive

jurisdiction clause in another agreement.

       
3  in its decision, the tribunal rejected the state’s objections and

affirmed its own jurisdiction to hear the investor’s claims.

dissatisfied, the state brought proceedings in the singapore courts

to set aside the decision (“the setting aside proceedings”). the

setting aside proceedings have since been transferred to the

singapore international commercial court (“sicc”).

       
4  in defending the tribunal’s decision in the setting aside

proceedings, the investor applied to the high court to admit mr

gearing to represent it. the investor contended that the underlying

issues in the setting aside proceedings were “complex”,

“significant”, “completely novel” and of “potentially precedential

value”. the investor argued that mr gearing’s assistance was

necessary, as there were no local counsel available with the

relevant expertise, or who were otherwise appropriate to act for it

in the setting aside proceedings.

       
the high court’s decision
5  the high court remarked that this application for ad hoc

admission was unique in that the investor was seeking to admit mr

gearing to defend a decision that had been rendered in its favour.

moreover, insofar as the issues were alleged to be complex and

novel, the investor had already argued against those objections

before the tribunal and succeeded (at [24] and            [29]).

        
6  moreover, the high court considered that it would be the state (and

not the investor) who would be making these allegedly complex

arguments in the setting aside proceedings. in this regard, the

tribunal had issued a thoroughly-reasoned decision resolving

several of these allegedly complex issues by a plain textual

interpretation of the bilateral treaty and relatively

straightforward factual analyses. this could not be said to be a

situation where the cards were stacked against the investor (at[24], [27] and            [29]).

        
mandatory requirements
7   the high court accepted the investor’s submission that mr gearing

fulfilled the mandatory requirements for ad hoc admission.

mr gearing had successfully argued the jurisdictional issues before

the tribunal and it would be odd to claim he did not have the

special qualifications and expertise for the purpose of the setting

aside proceedings (at [19]).

        
complexity of the issues
8    however, the high court was not persuaded the issues involved were

sufficiently complex. although the underlying dispute between the

investor and the state involved issues of public international law,

investor-state treaties and international obligations, the relevant

inquiry was the state’s objections to jurisdiction (at            [19] and [23]).

        
9    in this regard, the high court elaborated that:

       
      (a) the mere fact that public international law was the focus did not

necessarily elevate the complexity of the issues involved. these

simply concerned fundamental principles of statutory interpretation

and treaty interpretation, which were not alien to the singapore

courts and which was not beyond the competence of local senior

practitioners (at [39]–[41],            [47]–[49], [59]

and [63]);

        
      (b) if complex doctrinal debates in public international law arose,

those arguments had already been made before the tribunal. the

investor had the benefit of previous research and authorities, and

would have the benefit of mr gearing’s written submissions. if the

court were to feel that further assistance was required, it was

open to it to invite an amicus curiae to assist (at[51]–[52] and            [56]);

        
      (c) local counsel had encountered similar issues in dealing with

statutory time-bars, stay of proceeding applications in favour of

foreign arbitration, conflict of law issues, and abuse of process

arguments. these issues were not beyond the competence of local

counsel who commonly handled litigation with cross-border elements

(at [59] and [63]); and

        
      (d) the sicc’s bench comprised of experienced local and foreign judges,

and the court itself would possess the necessary expertise (at            [85]).

        

search for, and availability of, local counsel



10    the high court commented that the investor’s search for local counsel was

sorely lacking. initially, the investor cursorily offered the names of two

local senior counsel, one of whom was opposing counsel representing the

state. when the state proposed the names of nine other local counsel, the

investor rejected them despite not having approached any of them to ask if

they would be willing or able to represent it in the setting aside

proceedings (at [75]–[77]).




11  the high court observed that if the issues involved were truly beyond

local counsel’s ability because they were too esoteric and complex, or if

there was a conflict of interest, local counsel should be expected to be

open and candid enough to declare their conflicts, or to admit that the

issues involved were too complicated. in that event, the high court was

confident that local counsel would be willing to second-chair or co-chair

for learning purposes so they could take the lead the next time around (at    [77] and [80]).




12  as a result of the foregoing, the high court dismissed mr gearing’s

application and ordered the investor to pay costs to the state (at    [89]).
