toh eng tiah v jiang angelina and another appeal 

[2021] sgca 17



civil appeals nos 73 and 74 of 2020




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





decision of the court of appeal (delivered by justice of the court of

appeal andrew phang boon leong):





outcome: coa holds that a purported loan agreement was a sham and

finds that transfers made from one party to another were gifts and not

loans.



pertinent and significant points of the judgment:



· the parol evidence rule embodied in ss 93 and 94 of the evidence act (cap

97, 1997 rev ed) only applies if there is a contract in the first place: at    [71]. as such, the parol evidence rule has no application

when the allegation is that a purported agreement is a sham, since, if the

agreement is proved to be a sham that would mean that it was not intended

to create enforceable legal obligations and no contract would have been

formed: at [77].




background




1 the appellant in ca/ca 73/2020 (“ca 73”) and the respondent in ca/ca

74/2020 (“ca 74”) was mr toh eng tiah (“mr toh”). the respondent in ca 73

and the appellant in ca 74 was ms angelina jiang (“ms jiang”). mr toh and

ms jiang met each other sometime in november 2016 and entered into a

romantic relationship around 20 december 2016.




2 mr toh was married at the material time. he was a director and

shareholder of a number of companies, including st paper resources pte ltd

(“mr toh’s company”). ms jiang was a licensed property agent and manager of

a construction and engineering company, and the owner of a property at 13

prome road.




3 ms jiang received money from mr toh on a number of occasions between

december 2016 and march 2017. these transfers are summarised in the

4 item 1 was remitted to ms jiang to assist her in purchasing a shophouse.

items 2 to 12 were intended to be used for various expenses and to pay off

debts that ms jiang owed.




5 between january and february 2017, ms jiang also transferred various sums

totalling $95,000 to mr toh. this amount formed part of ms jiang’s

counterclaim.




6 items 13 to 16 were transfers relating to the purchase of a house at 9

hillcrest road. on 26 january 2017, mr toh issued a cheque of $30,800 (item

13) and the option to purchase was issued in ms jiang’s name. after an

initial cheque was countermanded, mr toh issued a new cheque on 27 february

2017 for $123,200 (item 14) for ms jiang to exercise the option to

purchase.




7 when issues with the financing of the purchase of 9 hillcrest road arose,

various proposals were considered and rejected by the parties. however,

sometime between 23 and 27 february 2017, they decided that some terms

should be documented. ms jiang instructed her solicitor, mr christopher

yong (“mr yong”) to begin preparing a formal document. a series of drafts

was exchanged between ms jiang’s lawyers and mr toh’s lawyer, ms pamela

chong. these drafts resulted in what was called the loan facilities

agreement (“lfa”). before the lfa was signed, mr toh passed a cheque of

$250,000 to ms jiang (item 15). the lfa was signed on 24 march 2017.




8 the lfa provided that the loan facility was in the amount of $2m. out of

that sum, it was stated that mr toh had already advanced $1,128,000 by

march 2017 (this included the $250,000 advanced on 21 march 2017) and that

the remainder would be disbursed by cashier’s order or cheque for $872,000

(cl 2.2). the loan facility was to be fully repaid upon either the sale of

13 prome road or on the redemption date (ie, 10 years from the

date of full disbursement of the loan facility or upon occurrence of an

event of default), whichever was earlier.




9 the sum of $1,128,000 mentioned in cl 2.2 had been arrived at by adding

items 1 to 15 together then deducting the $95,000 which ms jiang had

transferred to mr toh. this gave a figure of $1,128,532 which was then

rounded down to $1,128,000.




10 on 24 march 2017, after the lfa was signed, mr toh handed a cheque for

$872,000 to ms jiang (item 16 above). ultimately, however, the purchase of

9 hillcrest road did not go through.




11 sometime around 31 march 2017, ms jiang transferred a sum of $150,000 to

mr toh. following this, mr yong prepared three drafts of a deed of gift on

ms jiang’s instructions, but none of these was executed by mr toh. the

parties grew distant and, by 12 may 2017, ms jiang was unable to contact mr

toh.




the decision of the high court




12 in hc/s 621/2017, mr toh claimed repayment of the sum of $2m referred to

in the lfa, on the basis that the moneys that he had advanced to ms jiang

were loans and not gifts. he also sought to set aside the lfa in order to

obtain immediate repayment. in response, ms jiang asserted that all of the

moneys transferred to her had been gifts. as for the lfa, her primary case

was that it was unenforceable as a sham. she claimed that they had intended

that the lfa would only be used to placate mr toh’s wife (“mdm chong”),

enhance mr toh’s standing in the eyes of his colleagues and friends, and

also to obtain funds from mr toh’s company for the purchase of 9 hillcrest

road. ms jiang also counterclaimed for, inter alia, the sums of

$95,000 and $150,000 that she had transferred to mr toh.




13 the high court judge (“the judge”) came to the following conclusions on

the specific transfers:




a. item 1 was a loan as the parties had entered into an express loan

agreement and they had met just the month before.




b. items 2 to 12 were gifts. mr toh had promised to provide for ms jiang

and there was nothing in the contemporaneous evidence to suggest that these

were loans.




c. items 13 and 14 were gifts. the judge rejected mr toh’s evidence that 9

hillcrest road was ms jiang’s investment property and found instead that

both parties were looking to buy a property together at the time.




d. items 15 and 16 were loans, as item 15 was transferred while the lfa was

being drafted and item 16 was described in the lfa as a loan. the judge

found that the lfa was complete on its face and there was no ambiguity. the

parties were legally represented and the lfa went through a number of

drafts. the parties’ intention was therefore to be found in the lfa and the

parol evidence rule in ss 93 and 94 of the evidence act (cap 97, 1997 rev

ed) (“ea”) applied.




14 the judge rejected mr toh’s attempts to set aside the lfa, as there was

no evidence that mr toh could not appreciate the document he had signed, he

had access to counsel, he could have sought clarification on the terms of

the lfa, and he had indeed protected his own interests. as for the

counterclaim, the judge found that the sums of $95,000 and $150,000 were

transferred by ms jiang as loans to mr toh. hence, as mr toh was only

entitled to immediate repayment of item 1 ($200,000), and ms jiang was

entitled to be paid $245,000, the judge set off the sums and ordered mr toh

to pay $45,000 to ms jiang. the judge awarded ms jiang the costs of the

suit fixed at $174,000 and reasonable disbursements.




the court of appeal’s decision




15 mr toh and ms jiang appealed against the respective parts of the judge’s

decision that were not in their favour. ca 73 was mr toh’s appeal against

the judge’s decision concerning items 2 to 14, the vitiating factors and

the counterclaim (to the extent that it was allowed). ca 74 was ms jiang’s

appeal against the judge’s decision concerning items 1, 15 and 16.






whether the judge’s characterisation of items 1 to 14 were correct






16 the court of appeal (“the court”) observed that a valid gift    inter vivos was made where there was an intention to gift and

delivery of the precise subject matter of the gift. the subjective

intention of the donor was assessed at the time of the transfer. a gift

could not be revoked unless some ground for setting aside the transfer

could be found. however, the court left open the question of whether no

subsequent agreement could oblige a donee to repay a sum of money initially

given as a gift: at [52], [53] and [55].




17 in relation to item 1, ms jiang did not appeal against the judge’s

finding that it was a loan. her argument was that the repayment of the loan

was waived by mr toh. the court found that the representations made by mr

toh did not amount to waiver of her obligation to repay the $200,000: at    [56] and [59].




18 in relation to items 2 to 12, the court found that the judge correctly

considered the transfers against the background of the parties’ romantic

relationship. mr toh had not challenged the judge’s findings about their

relationship on appeal. once those factual findings were accepted, the only

question was whether there was evidence to show that the transfers were

otherwise treated as loans. however, there was none. the messages in which

ms jiang appeared to state that she would “return” the moneys “owe[d]” were

not premised on a legal obligation to repay. the handwritten notes relied

upon by mr toh to suggest that the parties kept strict records of the

transfers were also not probative: at [61]–[63].




19 in relation to items 13 and 14, the court agreed with the judge that the

purpose of the purchase of 9 hillcrest road was to provide a home for mr

toh and ms jiang. the court agreed with the judge’s finding that mr toh’s

claim for items 13 and 14 was inconsistent with his decision not to seek

repayment for the sum advanced for the option fee for another property the

parties were viewing at the time. the transfers also occurred before the

lfa was drafted or contemplated, and there was no other evidence that the

transfers were loans instead of gifts: at [66].




whether the judge erred in his conclusions on the lfa




20 the court first considered whether the judge erred in his application of

the parol evidence rule embodied in ss 93 and 94 of the ea. sections 93 and

94 operated in conjunction as rules concerning the proof of the terms of

the contract. as the application of s 94 of the ea was contingent on the

application of s 93, the central question was whether s 93 of the ea

applied. section 93 would not apply where parties have not reduced the

contract to the form of a document and where there was no requirement to do

so. implicit in this requirement was that there was a contract in the first

place: at [69]–[71].




21 the essential element of a sham was that the parties did not intend to

create the legal relations that the acts done or documents executed gave

the impression of creating. hence, the legal basis for the courts not

enforcing a sham agreement lay in the absence of an intention to create

legal relations, which was an essential element of finding the existence of

a contract. where the allegation was that the agreement was a sham, that

was a question that went to the very existence of the contract. it followed

that the issue of whether the agreement was a sham was prior to and would

necessarily not engage s 93 of the ea and, accordingly, s 94. as the judge

based his reasoning primarily on the parol evidence rule, this was an

appropriate case for the court to re-examine the evidence: at[74], [76], [77] and    [79].




22 the court then considered whether the facts disclosed a sham. the court

found that while there were arguments going both ways, there was enough

evidence on which to find a common intention between mr toh and ms jiang

that the lfa would not create the legal rights and obligations which it

gave the appearance of creating: at [81].




a. against the background of the gifts and the parties’ romantic

relationship, the introduction of the lfa as a formal commercial agreement

appeared incongruent: at [84].




b. the lfa included items 1 to 12 but described the loans as being for the

purchase of 9 hillcrest road. there was no reason why items 1 to 12 should

be included in the lfa as the moneys had already been transferred and

spent, and it was obviously false to state that they were for the purpose

of purchasing 9 hillcrest road. the history of the drafting of the lfa also

showed that the prior transfers were not included in the lfa from the

outset. the evidence supported ms jiang’s explanation that they were

included as mdm chong had discovered the existence of these prior

transfers. as it was ms jiang’s belief that the moneys she had received

from mr toh prior to the lfa were gifts, she must have received some

assurance from mr toh that she would not be prejudiced by the

characterisation of those sums as moneys advanced under the lfa: at    [86]–[89].




c. the parties intended to purchase 9 hillcrest road as a home. this

supported ms jiang’s case and contradicted the recital in the lfa which

referred to the purchase as being for investment: at [90]

and [91].




d. the lfa emerged at a time when mr toh was contemplating a divorce and

there were serious rifts between him and mdm chong, and while there were

also issues pertaining to the financing of the purchase of 9 hillcrest

road. as mr toh had taken a bank loan to reduce the value of assets

available to mdm chong in the event of divorce, ms jiang’s claim that the

lfa was intended to get around mdm chong’s objections to further transfers

of money was plausible. mr toh had also rejected other proposed financing

arrangements as he did not wish to burden ms jiang and this likely carried

over to when they decided to enter into a written agreement. the evidence

also showed that the lfa was a response to issues arising from mdm chong’s

knowledge of their relationship, the consequent restrictions on mr toh’s

finances, and the need for mr toh to assist ms jiang in financing the

purchase of 9 hillcrest road. there was also evidence that mr toh was

willing to let ms jiang have the money without a written agreement:    [93]–[100] and [102]–[105].




e. mr toh admitted during cross-examination that the parties had a mutual

understanding that the lfa would not be enforced against ms jiang. further,

his messages to ms jiang in april 2017 were inconsistent with his claim

that he had been “cheated” by ms jiang as to the terms of the lfa: at    [108] and [109].




f. mr toh had not asked his lawyer to be at the signing of the lfa, and had

told mr yong and ms jiang that this was because he had discharged his

lawyer. this was revealing of mr toh’s attitude towards the lfa: at    [110] and [111].




23 the court also considered the countervailing factors but found that they

could either be explained consistently with a sham or were not sufficiently

probative as to displace the factors above.




a. while both parties engaged lawyers, this was consistent with a desire to

make the lfa look as legitimate as possible. the fact that both parties

included terms that protected their interests could plausibly have been to

make the lfa look realistic, or to protect their interests if the lfa was

sued upon by a party who was not aware of the sham: at    [113].




b. while mr toh acted on the lfa by delivering a cheque for $872,000 after

signing the lfa, the mere fact that money was transferred in compliance

with the form prescribed by the lfa did not necessarily mean that the lfa

was not a sham, because the sham was not intended to hide the    existence of the transfers: at [115].




c. even though there was no evidence that the lfa was used for the purposes

alleged by ms jiang, the court observed that a failed purpose did not mean

that the parties did not have that purpose in the first place. the court

also found that the purposes alleged by ms jiang would have been served by

the lfa: at [116] and [117]).




d. the draft deed of gift, which mr toh argued showed that ms jiang knew

that the sums advanced under the lfa were loans, was never executed because

ms jiang thought that it was ultimately unnecessary on the basis of mr

toh’s assurances that the moneys were gifts: at [119].




e. a voice recording and various photographs of messages purportedly from

ms jiang were not given much weight as they lacked context: at    [120]–[122].




f. the mere fact that the parties recorded the sums transferred to ms jiang

in handwritten notes was equally consistent with a desire to ensure that

the sham agreement accounted for all of the moneys transferred: at    [123].




24 the court therefore found that the lfa was a sham. the lfa was not

enforceable against ms jiang and the court reversed the judge’s findings on

items 15 and 16. further, the lfa would not be relevant in determining

whether items 2 to 12 were gifts: at [126].






whether the judge erred in allowing ms jiang’s counterclaim to the

extent that he did






25 the judge did not err in allowing ms jiang’s counterclaim for the sums

of $95,000 and $150,000. the $95,000 was transferred to mr toh and was not

proved to be for repayment of any existing debt. mr toh also admitted that

the $150,000 was a loan: at [128] and    [129].



conclusion



26 the court therefore dismissed ca 73 and allowed ca 74 in part. the court

upheld the judge’s finding that ms jiang owed $200,000 (item 1) to mr toh,

and that mr toh owed $245,000 to ms jiang. setting off these sums against

each other, mr toh was to pay $45,000 to ms jiang. as ms jiang succeeded in

ca 73 and substantially succeeded in ca 74, the court awarded her costs of

the appeals fixed at $75,000 (all-in): at [132].
