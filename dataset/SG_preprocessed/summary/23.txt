supreme court of singapore18 december 2023case summarylee shin nan v public prosecutor [2023] sghc 354magistrate’s appeal no. 9066 of 2023-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the general division of the high court (comprising sundaresh menon cj)(judgment delivered by sundaresh menon cj):outcome: the general division of the high court dismisses the appeal against the appellant’s sentence and considers the sentencing framework for repeat drink-driving offences.pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  the court applied a sentencing framework for repeat drink driving offences that comprised a four-stage process as follows: (a) determine the sentence range for the offence based on the offender’s alcohol levels as though the offender were a first-time offender and then apply an uplift to the range of the fine and disqualification period, taking into account only the level of alcohol for the present conviction; (b) consider factors that pertain to the repetition of the offending behaviour to arrive at a provisional assessment of the fine and disqualification period; (c) consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence and the offender and make further adjustments to the provisional assessment of the fine and the disqualification period; and (d) calibrate the term of imprisonment and review the sentence as a whole: at [57]–[73].•  special reasons (that would justify ordering a shorter period of disqualification) will generally be found only if the court is satisfied that the offender drove in circumstances that reasonably suggest (a) it was necessary to do so in order to avoid other likely and serious harm or danger; and (b) there was no reasonable alternative way to achieve this end: at [79].•  when assessing when an enhanced sentence under s 67a of the road traffic act 1961 (2020 rev ed) (“rta”) may be imposed, the court may consider whether the offender’s antecedents reflect a cavalier disregard of the law, whether the offender’s antecedent sentences come close to the maximum sentences prescribed for the relevant offences, and whether the duration and frequency of reoffending suggests the need to go well past the maximum sentences prescribed for the relevant offences: at [89].•  the sentence imposed was fair and should be upheld: at [91]–[101].background to the appeal1 the present appeal was brought by mr lee shin nan (“mr lee”) against the imprisonment term and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for life (the “lifetime disqualification order”) that had been imposed on him following his conviction on a charge of driving while under the influence of drink pursuant to s 67(1)(b) of the rta punishable under s 67(1) read with ss 67(2a) and 67a(1)(a) of the rta.2 this was his third conviction under s 67(1)(b) of the rta.the material facts3 on 26 june 2022, mr lee was stopped at a police roadblock while driving. it was found that the proportion of alcohol in his breath exceeded the prescribed permitted quantity of alcohol.4 he was charged under s 67(1)(b) of the rta. he pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 (or in default one month’s imprisonment). he was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for life.5 mr lee paid the fine but appealed in the hope of having the term of imprisonment and the lifetime disqualification order reversed or reduced.decision on appeal6 the sentencing framework provided in rafael voltaire alzate v public prosecutor [2022] 3 slr 993 (the “rafael voltaire framework”) can only guide the sentencing of first-time drink driving offenders. a separate sentencing framework is required for repeat drink driving offences under s 67 of the rta which are subject to higher minimum and maximum fines, mandatory imprisonment and a longer minimum period of disqualification: at [41].7 while there is nothing to say that s 67 was drafted to exclude cases where there is harm to person or property, it was not necessary to develop a framework that can be applied to repeat offenders under s 67 who have caused harm to person or property. in most such cases, the offenders are likely to be prosecuted under ss 64 or 65 of the rta: at [50]–[51].8 the sentencing framework for repeat drink driving offences should comprise a four-stage process (the “repeat offences framework”): at [57].a. at the first stage, the court should determine the sentence range for the offence based on the offender’s category of alcohol level (“alcohol level band”) as if the offender were a first-time offender, using the sentencing ranges set out in the rafael voltaire framework, and then apply an uplift to the range of the fine and the disqualification period taking into account only the level of alcohol for the present conviction: at [57(a)].b. at the second stage, the court should pay particular attention to the consideration of those factors that pertain to the repetition of the offending behaviour. the court should arrive at a provisional assessment of the fine and disqualification period within the applicable range: at [57(b)].c. at the third stage, the court should consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence and the offender and make any further adjustments to the provisional assessment of the fine and disqualification period: at [57(c)].d. at the fourth stage, the court should calibrate the appropriate term of imprisonment having regard in particular to the need for deterrence and then review the sentence as a whole: at [57(d)].9 at the first stage of the repeat offences framework, the inquiry is focused on the offender’s blood/breath alcohol levels which is the sole ingredient of the offence under s 67(1)(b) of the rta. in computing the uplift from the ranges applicable to first-time offenders, it is appropriate to consider an uplift of a fine of between $3,000 and $7,500 and a disqualification period of between 36 months and 60 months for the various alcohol level bands. this leaves some headroom for further adjustments at the next stage: at [58] and [62]–[63].10 at the second stage, the court should calibrate the provisional fine and disqualification period having regard to (a) the actual quantity of alcohol within the applicable alcohol level band and (b) the circumstances that pertain to the repetition of the offending behaviour. the court will begin with the range prescribed by the applicable alcohol level band but it is open to the court to shift to a lower or higher band if these two factors point that way: at [64]–[67].11 at the third stage, the court should consider all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances pertaining to the offence and the offender and determine whether the fine and the disqualification it has arrived at requires any further adjustments, subject to the minimum and maximum permitted statutory limits. aggravating factors should be considered at this stage for any impact that they may have on the fine or the period of disqualification: at [68]–[69].12 at the fourth stage, the court should separately consider the appropriate term of imprisonment having regard to all the circumstances. where the aggravating factors considered at the previous stage point to a custodial term, they should be considered at this stage when assessing the term of imprisonment. such factors would include: (a) the manner and circumstances of driving and road conditions; (b) the nature and number of relevant antecedents; (c) the recency of antecedents; and (d) the actual and potential danger posed to others, these being the key factors that are relevant to deterrence (both general and specific) and to why imprisonment was made mandatory for this class of offenders. where zero to two aggravating factors are present and operating at a relatively low level, the offence would be classed as a “serious” case warranting an imprisonment term of 1 to 6 months. where there are two to three factors (or if there are fewer but these operate at a more pronounced level), the offence would fall into the “more serious” band warranting 6 to 12 months’ imprisonment. and if all factors are present (or if there are fewer factors but most of them are operating at a pronounced level), the offence would fall into the “most serious” band warranting 12 to 24 months’ imprisonment: at [70]–[72].13 the sentencing court should then take a final look at the sentence to assess if the fine and disqualification order should be adjusted, whether there is a basis and need to enhance the punishment under s 67a and whether the overall punishment is proportional and condign: at [73].14 the unifying principle to be distilled with respect to s 67(2a) of the rta is that special reasons (that would justify ordering a shorter period of disqualification) will generally be found only if the court is satisfied that the offender drove in circumstances that reasonably suggest (a) it was necessary to do so in order to avoid other likely and serious harm or danger; and (b) there was no reasonable alternative way to achieve this end: at [79].15 the inquiry as to whether the imposition of enhanced penalties under s 67a is warranted in a given case should be undertaken as a separate inquiry after the court has considered the punishment that the offender would be liable for without regard to s 67a: at [84].16 when assessing whether to enhance the sentence pursuant to s 67a of the rta, the court may consider whether the offender’s antecedents reflect a cavalier disregard of the law, whether the offender’s antecedent sentences come close to the maximum sentences prescribed for the relevant offences, and whether the duration and frequency of reoffending suggests the need to go well past the maximum sentences prescribed for the relevant offences: at [89].17 the application of the repeat offences framework would not have provided for a more favourable outcome than what the district judge had sentenced mr lee to. the sentence imposed by the district judge was fair and accordingly was affirmed: at [91]–[101].this summary is provided to
