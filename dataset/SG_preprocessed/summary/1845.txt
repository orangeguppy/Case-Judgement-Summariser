magistrate’s appeal nos 9301 and 9302 of 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of the high court (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon):
outcome: high court allows the prosecution’s appeal against the sentences imposed on mr wong chee meng (“wong”) and mr chia sin lan (“chia”), who each faced three charges of participating in a corrupt transaction with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the prevention of corruption act (cap 241, 1993 rev ed) (“the pca”). the aggregate sentences of 27 months’ imprisonment and 21 months’ imprisonment imposed on wong and chia respectively by the district judge (“the district judge”) were increased to aggregate sentences of 39 months’ imprisonment and 33 months’ imprisonment. the high court separately declines the prosecution’s application for an attachment order to enforce payment of a monetary penalty imposed by the district judge under s 13 of the pca.
pertinent and significant points of the judgment:

the high court sets out a sentencing framework for the aggravated offence of participating in a corrupt transaction with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the prevention of corruption act (cap 241, 1993 rev ed) (“the pca”).

background to the appeal
1 wong was an employee of cpg facilities management pte ltd (“cpg”), the managing agent of ang mo kio town council (“amktc”). pursuant to his employment, he was appointed as the general manager and secretary of amktc between november 2013 and november 2016. in these capacities, wong was in charge of amktc’s operations and his duties included overseeing and providing inputs on the selection of contractors for the execution of works. wong was privy to important contract information and attended meetings at which contractors were recommended and selected. 
2 chia was a shareholder and the directing mind and will of two companies, 19-anc enterprise pte ltd (“19-anc”) and 19-ns2 enterprise pte ltd (“19-ns2”) (collectively, “the companies”). 19-anc was in the business of, among other things, tendering for construction-related works at various town councils, while 19-ns2 acted mainly as a subcontractor to 19-anc.
3 between 2014 and 2016, wong received various types of gratification as inducement for advancing the business interests of the companies in their business dealings with amktc. the various types of gratification given to wong were not tied to him showing favour to the companies in any particular transaction. rather, they were given to cultivate wong such that he would become beholden to chia and advance the business interests of the companies with amktc.

4 wong and chia each pleaded guilty (midway through the trial) to three charges under s 6 read with s 7 of the pca corresponding to three types of gratification given to wong, which were all procured or provided by chia. the first consisted of a discount of s$13,500 given to wong in relation to the purchase of a motor car from 19-anc (“the discount charge”). the second consisted of remittances amounting to about rmb 130,000 (approximately s$27,796.02) made to wong’s mistress in china (“the remittance charge”). the third consisted of entertainment expenses totalling s$34,070.04 incurred at various establishments (“the entertainment charge”). two other similar charges were taken into consideration.
5 the district judge sentenced wong and chia as follows:




wong – aggregate sentence 27 months’ imprisonment




charge


sentence




discount charge


12 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




remittance charge


15 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




entertainment charge


12 months’ imprisonment (concurrent)




chia – aggregate sentence 21 months’ imprisonment




discount charge


9 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




remittance charge


12 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




entertainment charge


12 months’ imprisonment (concurrent)






6 the district judge additionally imposed a penalty of s$23,398.09 (with one month’s imprisonment in default) on wong under s 13 of the pca.
7 both the prosecution and the defence appealed against the sentences imposed by the district judge. as part of its submissions, the prosecution invited the court to adopt a sentencing framework modelled on` that set out in logachev vladislav v public prosecutor [2018] 4 slr 609 (“logachev”) for offences under s 6 of the pca (with a modified version for the aggravated offence under s 6 read with s 7 of the pca). the prosecution separately sought attachment orders against wong pursuant to s 319(1)(b) of the criminal procedure code (cap 68, 2012 rev ed) (“the cpc”) to enforce the payment of the penalty out of certain funds seized from him.
the court’s decision
the appropriate sentencing framework for offences under section 6 read with section 7 of the pca
 
8 the high court was of the view that it would be appropriate to set out a sentencing framework for offences committed under s 6 read with s 7 of the pca modelled on the two-stage, five-step framework adopted in logachev. the general approach towards sentencing in corruption cases of having regard to past cases and identifying a number of categories and factors pertinent to the sentencing process would not always be conducive to achieving broad consistency in sentencing across cases. the disadvantage that inhered in the lack of a sentencing framework was reflected in the fact that the sentencing precedents cited by wong and chia were not of much assistance: at [49]–[57].
9 the first step of this framework, which would apply only to the aggravated offence under s 6 read with s 7 of the pca, involved identifying the offence-specific factors in the case. the high court set out a non-exhaustive table of relevant offence-specific factors (at [61]–[62]):




offence-specific factors




factors going towards harm
(a) actual loss caused to principal
(b) benefit to the giver of gratification
(c) type and extent of loss to third parties
(d) public disquiet
(e) offences committed as part of a group or syndicate
(f) involvement of a transnational element


factors going towards culpability
(a) amount of gratification given or received
(b) degree of planning and premeditation
(c) level of sophistication
(d) duration of offending
(e) extent of the offender’s abuse of position and breach of trust
(f) offender’s motive in committing the offence
 




 
10 the framework also involved identifying relevant offender-specific factors, and the high court set out a non-exhaustive table of offender-specific factors (at [79]):
 





offender-specific factors




aggravating factors


mitigating factors




  (a)offences taken into consideration for        sentencing purposes
  (b)relevant antecedents
  (c)evident lack of remorse


  (a)a guilty plea
  (b)co-operation with the authorities
  (c) actions taken to minimise harm to victims





11 the second step involved identifying the indicative sentencing range for the offence in question utilising the following sentencing matrix, which would apply in a claim trial situation (at [84]):




 


harm




slight


moderate


severe




 
 
 
culpability


low


fine or up to 1 year’s imprisonment


1 to 2 year’s imprisonment


2 to 3 years’ imprisonment




medium


1 to 2 year’s imprisonment


2 to 3 years’ imprisonment


3 to 4.5 years’ imprisonment




high


2 to 3 years’ imprisonment


3 to 4.5 years’ imprisonment


4.5 to 7 years’ imprisonment




 
12 the third step involved identifying the indicative starting point within the sentencing range that had been chosen. the fourth step involved making adjustments to the indicative starting point to account for offender-specific factors present. the final step involved making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle: at [86]–[88].
application of the framework
 
13 the high court applied the sentencing framework to the facts of this case. the harm caused by the offences fell within the lower end of the “moderate” category. first, chia derived substantial benefits from his cultivation of wong. wong, as an insider in amktc, was able to provide chia and the companies with invaluable assistance and support, intervening on several occasions to ensure that their interests were protected or even advanced. second, the offences caused harm to third parties such as competitors of the companies, who were forced to compete on unequal terms due to the favourable treatment accorded to the companies by wong: at [91], [92] and [94].
14 turning to culpability, wong’s culpability fell within the “medium” category. as for chia, his culpability in respect of the entertainment charge fell within the “medium” category, while his culpability in relation to the discount charge and remittance charge fell within the higher end of the “low” category. first, the amounts of gratification involved in the discount charge, remittance charge and entertainment charge, being s$13,500, s$27,796.02 and s$34,070.04 respectively, were sizeable. specific to the remittance charge, the district judge was not correct in treating the remittance charge as less serious on the ground that the gratification there might have been given in the form of loans, or that wong had repaid some part of these sums to chia. for the entertainment charge, the district judge was not correct in focusing on the sum of s$7,000 said to be wong’s personal share of the expenses rather than the sum of s$34,070.34 stated in the charge. second, the offences were fairly sophisticated and involved considerable planning and premeditation. third, wong abused his position as the general manager of amktc and the high degree of trust reposed in him to commit the offences. fourth, wong and chia were motivated by greed. finally, the district judge was entitled to find that wong was more culpable than chia in respect of the discount charge and remittance charge as he had initiated the events leading to the offences: at [95]–[101].
15 based on the sentencing matrix, the following starting points within the sentencing ranges were appropriate:




wong




charge


starting point




discount charge


24 months’ imprisonment 




remittance charge


24 months’ imprisonment 




entertainment charge


26 months’ imprisonment 




chia 




discount charge


18 months’ imprisonment 




remittance charge


20 months’ imprisonment 




entertainment charge


26 months’ imprisonment 




 
16 the main offender-specific factor which applied was wong’s and chia’s plea of guilt. also relevant was the fact that wong and chia consented to having two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. in all the circumstances, a reduction of four months’ imprisonment per charge was warranted at the fourth step of the framework: at [103]–[106].
17 at the final step of the framework, having regard to the overall criminality present and the fact that at least two of the sentences imposed were to run consecutively under s 307 of the cpc, the high court further reduced the sentence for the discount charge by three months. the sentences for the discount charge and entertainment charge were ordered to run consecutively. the prosecution’s appeal against sentence was thus allowed and the following sentences substituted for those imposed by the district judge (at [107] and [112]):
 




wong – aggregate sentence 39 months’ imprisonment




charge


sentence




discount charge


17 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




remittance charge


20 months’ imprisonment (concurrent)




entertainment charge


22 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




chia – aggregate sentence 33 months’ imprisonment




discount charge


11 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)




remittance charge


16 months’ imprisonment (concurrent)




entertainment charge


22 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)





 
the attachment orders
 
18 the high court declined to grant the prosecution’s application for an attachment order to enforce payment of the monetary penalty. the principles discussed in tay wee kiat and another v public prosecutor and another appeal [2019] 5 slr 1033 were found to be applicable in the present case. here, the prosecution could have deferred the issue of what consequential orders were needed to address any failure to pay the penalty, such as a default term of imprisonment or an attachment order. instead, it failed to do so, and a default order was made and there was no suggestion that the district judge erred in making it.
