engineering co ltd and another

civil appeal no 207 of 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of the court of appeal

(delivered by judge of appeal steven chong):
outcome: coa holds airtug operator and employer

liable for losses suffered by wang café due to closure of lounge after operator

drove airtug into t2 building.
1          civil appeal no 207 of 2017 was an

appeal by ntuc foodfare co-operative ltd (“ntuc foodfare”) against the decision

of the high court judge in ntuc foodfare

co-operative ltd v sia engineering co ltd and another [2017] sghc 250.
facts
2          the appellant (“ntuc foodfare”)

operated an outlet of wang café (“the kiosk”) in the transit lounge (“the

lounge”) on the second level of the terminal 2 building of changi airport (“the

t2 building”). the second respondent (“mr yap”), an employee of the first

respondent (“siaec”), operated airtugs (heavy vehicles used to move aircraft) in

the airport. 
3          mr yap failed to keep a proper lookout

while driving an airtug (“the airtug”) through the underpass baggage handling

area of the t2 building. the airtug collided into a pillar supporting the floor

of the lounge, causing damage to that floor. this led the building and

construction authority to issue a closure order over the affected area of the

lounge. the kiosk was situated within the affected area. ntuc foodfare was therefore

unable to operate the kiosk while the closure order was in force, and suffered

loss of profits during this period. additionally, some equipment at the kiosk

was damaged due to the closure. 
4          after the closure order was lifted,

ntuc foodfare rebuilt the kiosk and thereafter resumed business at the kiosk. 
5          ntuc foodfare sued the respondents to

recover economic losses allegedly caused by mr yap’s negligent operation of the

airtug. it claimed that mr yap owed it a duty of care, breached this duty, and

thereby caused it to suffer various economic losses. it also claimed that siaec

was vicariously liable for mr yap’s negligence.
6          the judge dismissed ntuc foodfare’s

claims on the principal basis that mr yap did not owe a duty of care to ntuc

foodfare. he was therefore not liable to ntuc foodfare and consequently, siaec

was not vicariously liable either. the judge also held that even if mr yap owed

a duty of care to ntuc foodfare, negligence on his part did not cause ntuc

foodfare to suffer losses related to the rebuilding of the kiosk (“the

rebuilding losses”).
decision on appeal
7          the court of appeal allowed ntuc

foodfare’s appeal in part.
8          the court first considered whether

there was physical damage to ntuc foodfare’s property, an issue arising from the

parties’ submissions. the court held that ntuc foodfare held a lease of the

premises where the kiosk was situated (“the premises”) although the premises

did not suffer any physical damage (at [33]).

however, this ultimately had no bearing on the outcome of the appeal (at [34]). 
9          the court then applied the test for

the establishment of a duty of care laid down in spandeck engineering (s) pte ltd v defence science & technology

agency [2007] 4 slr(r) 100 (“spandeck”)

to the facts. it was factually foreseeable that negligent operation of the

airtug would cause ntuc foodfare to suffer loss (at [45]). there was sufficient legal proximity between mr yap and ntuc

foodfare for a duty of care to arise (at [46]):

there was physical proximity between the parties, causal proximity between mr

yap’s negligence and ntuc foodfare’s loss, and the proximity factor of

knowledge applied (at [47], [48] and

[50]). there were no policy

considerations militating against recognising a duty of care (at [53]). 
10        the court then addressed the

respondents’ submission that a different test for the establishment of a duty

of care should apply in cases of “relational economic loss”. the court rejected

this submission for reasons of doctrinal coherence (at [60]), and on the basis that there was no compelling normative

justification for factors relied on in the foreign authorities cited by the

respondents to be transposed into singapore law (at [61] and [78]). the

court therefore found that mr yap owed a duty of care to ntuc foodfare (at [79]). 
11        finally, on the issue of causation, the

court found that mr yap’s negligence did not cause ntuc foodfare to suffer the

rebuilding losses, because the chain of causation was broken by ntuc foodfare’s

decision to rebuild the kiosk (at [83]).


12        the court of appeal therefore allowed

the appeal in part, holding that mr yap was liable in negligence for loss of

profits sustained by ntuc foodfare during the closure of the lounge and the

cost of repairing or replacing the damaged equipment, and that siaec was

vicariously liable for the same sum (at [84]).
