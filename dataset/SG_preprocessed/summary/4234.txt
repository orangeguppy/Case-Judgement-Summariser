criminal appeal no 52 of 2017
_____________________________________________________________________
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by judge of appeal tay yong kwang):
background
1          the respondent, kong peng yee, attacked and killed his wife (“the deceased”) on 13 march 2016 while experiencing a brief psychotic episode. he pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed) and was sentenced by the high court to two years’ imprisonment on 16 october 2017. the respondent was released from prison on the day that he was sentenced and thereafter resided voluntarily at the institute of mental health (“the imh”).
2          the prosecution appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate on the facts. the court of appeal enhanced the sentence to six years’ imprisonment.
 
the material facts and the charge
3          the respondent and the deceased were 68 and 63 years old at the time respectively. they had been married for about 36 years and had two daughters. 
4          on the afternoon of 13 march 2016, the deceased and the respondent were at home with their elder daughter. the respondent took a nap but was woken by what he described as roaring sounds around his ears. after their elder daughter left the flat, the respondent went to the kitchen and took a knife. he saw the deceased folding some clothes in the living room and stabbed her from the back with the knife. he then moved in front of the deceased and continued to stab her repeatedly. the deceased struggled and the respondent dropped the knife. the respondent then got a chopper from the kitchen and continued his attack on the deceased. his mind told him to “make sure she die”. the respondent stopped hacking the deceased with the chopper only when he realised that she was dead. the respondent said that he felt “happy”. 
5          the respondent then called his sister and told her that he had killed his wife. the respondent’s sister informed the elder daughter about this and asked her to call the police. the elder daughter then called the police. when the police arrived at the flat, the respondent was sitting on the sofa in the living room in blood-stained clothes and appeared dazed and was quiet. the deceased was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.
6          the autopsy found the cause of the deceased’s death to be haemorrhage due to multiple incised wounds to the head. a total of 189 injuries were noted, the most severe of which were concentrated around the deceased’s head and neck region. there was also extensive bruising all over the deceased’s body which was the result of blunt force trauma.
7          the respondent admitted that he had killed the deceased. he claimed that he believed his family would not look after him if he were unwell, that his elder daughter was not his biological daughter, and that she had reconciled with her “real” parents and disliked him. he said he believed that he should kill the deceased first because his family might want to kill him. 
 
psychiatric evidence
8          the respondent was assessed by dr kenneth koh (“dr koh”), a psychiatrist and senior consultant with the imh. dr koh opined that the respondent had late onset psychosis with persecutory, jealous and nihilistic/somatic delusions, and had experienced a brief psychotic episode at the time of the offence. these psychotic delusions would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions. the respondent had responded well to medication and entered into remission. his risk of dangerousness to others was low provided that he remained in a state of remission. however, there was a risk of relapse should he cease taking his current medication. 
9          dr koh considered that the respondent required long-term follow up with psychiatric services. he preferred the respondent’s medication to continue lifelong or at least for years until his physical health deteriorated to the point where he could pose no danger to others.
 
the court of appeal’s decision
10        the evidence suggested that the respondent’s psychosis impacted his thoughts and actions severely at the time of the offence. first, the respondent had never been violent towards his wife and the attack was out of character and unpremeditated. secondly, the respondent’s beliefs – ie, that his family would not look after him, that his elder daughter had reconciled with her “real parents” and disliked him, and that his family might want to kill him – were not based on evidence or logic. it was also inexplicable why the respondent felt he had to take action at the time when his wife was folding clothes and posed no threat at all to him. thirdly, the respondent’s attack on the deceased was excessively violent and showed his disordered mind at the time. fourthly, the respondent’s reaction of feeling “happy” when he realised that he had killed the deceased was unnatural. finally, the respondent’s beliefs and actions the day before the offence and after his arrest were incoherent and showed a disturbed mind which was detached from reality. ([63])
11        the moral culpability of mentally disordered offenders lay on a spectrum. on the one hand were offenders who, despite having temporary and situational mental disorders, retained their understanding of their actions and could reason and weigh the consequences. such offenders often evinced the ability to think logically and coherently, borne out by a sophisticated degree of planning and premeditation. on the other hand, there were offenders like the respondent whose mental disorders severely impaired their ability to understand the nature and consequences of their acts, to make reasoned decisions, or to control their impulses. although the respondent might have known how or even when to kill the deceased, his mind was in an unreal world in which he had to kill or be killed. he exhibited incoherent and irrational behaviour before, during and after the offence. whatever seemingly rational decisions he made were premised on totally unreal facts and completely irrational thoughts. his actions were not merely a maladaptive response to a difficult or depressive true situation but emanated from an impaired mind. ([64]–[66])
12        deterrence should not be a dominant consideration in this case because the respondent’s psychosis was causally linked to the offence and warped his understanding of reality. he was unlikely to reoffend in future provided that his mental state remained stable. as for the sentencing principle of retribution, though the harm was very severe, the brutality of the attack in this case was the work of a disordered mind rather than a cold and cruel one. the respondent’s culpability was accordingly very low. rehabilitation and prevention were the dominant sentencing principles in this case. rehabilitating the respondent while at the same time preventing him from harming others would better protect the respondent’s family and the public. ([72], [75], [79])
13        three sentencing options were available to the court: 
(a) first, the court could dismiss the appeal. if the respondent were to relapse, he might be detained for psychiatric treatment under the provisions of the mental health (care and treatment) act (cap 178a, 2012 rev ed). however, this was not satisfactory. the respondent was at liberty to leave the imh at any time without giving any reason. if he did so, there would then be no assurance that he would continue to take his prescribed medication. moreover, by the time he was detained, he might already have harmed other people. ([84]–[87])
(b) secondly, the court could order the respondent to undergo probation with a condition of residence at the imh. but this was not in keeping with the spirit and purpose of a probation order, which was generally suitable for less serious offences and tailored to the rehabilitation of young offenders in need of guidance and discipline. moreover, the respondent might still choose to breach the condition of residence and leave the imh, and it might be some time before he was apprehended and taken to court to be resentenced. ([92]–[95])
(c) thirdly, the court could enhance the sentence. this option was in the public interest. the respondent would have free and easy access to psychiatric services, live in a structured environment, and be subject to the supervision of trained staff who could ensure that he consumed his medication and assist him along the path of recovery. ([96])
14        a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was appropriate, taking into account (amongst others) the respondent’s prognosis; the need to ensure his continued compliance with his medication regime; his strong family support; and his age. this sentence would give the respondent sufficient time to become accustomed to the new reality of having to take medication in a disciplined manner, and assuage to a reasonable degree any concerns that the public might have about a potentially dangerous man living in its midst. ([99]–[100])
