(“the permission principles question”)b.  when should a pofma appeal be heard in open court? (“the open court question”)c. how should the third and fourth steps of the toc framework be applied to a situation where the subject statement is a report of a statement made by someone else? (“the report of statement question”)d. what is a statement of opinion for the purposes of the pofma? (“the opinion question”)the court’s decision principles governing permission to appeal in pofma cases5 first, the court rejected the sdp’s argument that pofma decisions were appealable as of right at the time the pofma was enacted. section 17(8) of the pofma and r 16 of the supreme court of judicature (protection from online falsehoods and manipulation) rules 2019 (no s 665), which first came into operation together with the pofma itself, provided a clear indication that appeals against pofma decisions were always intended to be subject to the same restrictions as appeals against decisions made by the high court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. this weighed against the sdp’s suggestion that a different approach to permission to appeal was intended to be (or should be) applied to pofma cases: at [27] and [28].6 next, the court rejected the sdp’s assertion that the requirement of permission to appeal from pofma decisions in para 3(m) of the fifth schedule was introduced without explanation by the supreme court of judicature (amendment) bill (bill no 32/2019) (“the 2019 scj amendment bill”), by way of an amendment to the fifth schedule which purported to be merely procedural in nature. the provision that was now para 3(m) was first introduced as para 1(j) of the fifth schedule to the supreme court of judicature act (cap 322, 2007 rev ed) (as was in force from 2 october 2019 to 11 september 2020). it was not inserted by the 2019 scj amendment bill but by the supreme court of judicature act (amendment of fifth schedule) order 2019 (s 666/2019) with effect from 2 october 2019 – the date of commencement of the pofma itself. the requirement of permission to appeal against pofma decisions had thus existed since the inception of the pofma: at [30].7 third, the court rejected the sdp’s argument that pofma decisions should be appealable as of right because such decisions disposed of the parties’ substantive rights. there was no legal rule that in cases where permission to appeal was required under the fifth schedule to the scja, permission ought to be granted where the decision below disposed of the parties’ substantive rights. a distinction ought to be drawn between restrictions relating to substantive matters as opposed to those concerning interlocutory matters on the one hand, and restrictions relating to the subject matter of the intended appeal on the other hand. where the relevant restriction on the right to appeal was a subject-matter restriction, it was irrelevant that the decision in question affected a party’s substantive rights. as para 3(m) of the fifth schedule to the scja plainly imposed a subject-matter restriction on the right to appeal, it was irrelevant that decisions falling within the scope of this paragraph might dispose of the parties’ substantive rights. according to the plain words of para 3(m), pofma decisions listed in that paragraph were appealable only with permission: at [34], [35] and [37].8 the court therefore rejected the sdp’s position that different principles or a different legal test should apply when considering applications for permission to appeal against pofma decisions, and that permission to appeal should normally be granted as a matter of course. permission to appeal would only be granted if the sdp established one or more of the well-established grounds set out in lee kuan yew: at [38] and [39].whether permission to appeal should be granted9 applying those principles, the sdp’s application for permission to appeal was dismissed as none of the questions framed by the sdp could be regarded as questions of general principle or importance which would arise for decision in an appeal against the judge’s decision in the os: at [62]. 10 the permission principles question was not a question that arose from the judge’s decision, nor was it one which would arise in the substantive appeal against the judge’s decision. instead, it arose in this application for permission to appeal and had already been addressed by the court: at [42]. 11 as for the open court question, the sdp was out of time to apply for permission to appeal against the judge’s decision to hear the os in chambers. accordingly, the open court question would not arise for this court’s determination in any appeal against the judge’s decision: at [44].12 in any event, the open court question was not a question of general principle or importance. its resolution involved the application of established principles to the specific facts of the present case. the default position stated in o 28 r 2 of the roc 2014 (now o 15 r 1(1) of the roc 2021) was that all originating summonses would be heard in chambers, and this applied even in respect of pofma cases. the legal principles regarding when a departure from this default statutory position would be justified were well established: the applicant seeking an open court hearing had to show “special reasons”. this was a fact-sensitive inquiry to which no general answer could be given: at [45] to [50].13 the report of statement question was not a question of general principle or importance that would arise in an appeal against the judge’s decision. the issues of whether a subject statement which was a report of a statement made by someone else was a “statement of fact” and whether that statement of fact was “false” could be answered by an application of the principles set out at the third and fourth steps of the analytical framework in the online citizen pte ltd v attorney-general and another appeal and other matters [2021] 2 slr 1358. no further explanation was needed: at [56].14 the opinion question was not a question of general principle or importance that would arise for determination in an appeal against the judge’s decision because its resolution turned ultimately on the specific facts of each case. the court had to take an objective approach in ascertaining whether the identified subject statement fell within the definition of a “statement of fact” in s 2(2)(a) of the pofma. the question of how a particular statement should be construed was a question of fact and there could be no set formula because it depended on the specific facts and context: at [58] and [61].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended
