clause should be determined on an objective basis without third-party input: at [43].•  there was insufficient evidence to show that the respondent’s decision on its own risk-taking calculus to refuse payment to the appellant was subject to the applicable restrictions provided for under the sanctions clause. it was hence not entitled to invoke the sanctions clause to deny payment to the appellant: at [68].•  while it was strictly not necessary to consider whether sanctions clauses were compatible with the commercial purpose of confirmations to letters of credit, it was noted that a balance must be struck between preserving the autonomy of individual contracts within a documentary credit transaction and upholding the commercial viability of the entire documentary credit transaction: at [69] and [77].•  it may be problematic for a bank to have it both ways by representing to a beneficiary that payment is conditioned only on a complying demand, but reserving the right to dishonour where it is unsure of its legal liabilities if it decides to pay: at [71].background to the appeal1 the present appeal was brought by kuvera resources pte ltd (“kuvera”) against jpmorgan chase bank, na (“jpmorgan”) against the dismissal of kuvera’s claim in suit 57.2 the dispute concerned jpmorgan’s denial of its liability to pay kuvera under the confirmations to two letters of credit, under which kuvera was the beneficiary. jpmorgan had denied payment on the basis that the confirmations bore a contractual clause (the “sanctions clause”) which extinguished jpmorgan’s liability to pay as the underlying commercial transaction was allegedly caught by the sanctions laws of the united states of america (the “us”).3 in suit 57, kuvera claimed that jpmorgan had acted unlawfully in not paying kuvera the sum due under kuvera’s complying presentation of documents under the letters of credit. the high court judge (the “judge”) dismissed kuvera’s claim in suit 57 in its entirety. the judge found that the sanctions clause had been duly incorporated as a contractual term of the confirmations to the two letters of credit, that the sanctions clause was valid and enforceable and that the sanctions clause entitled jpmorgan to refuse payment to kuvera.the material facts4 a company in indonesia (the “seller”) had contracted to sell coal to a company in the united arab emirates (“uae”). to facilitate this transaction, kuvera advanced funds to the seller to purchase the coal for on-selling to the buyer. the buyer was to pay for the coal by way of two letters of credit (the “lcs”) in which kuvera was to be named as the beneficiary. the bank which issued the lcs (the “issuing bank”) in turn appointed jpmorgan as the advising bank and nominated bank for the lcs, and jpmorgan duly advised both lcs and confirmed (the “confirmations”) the lcs and their amendments.5 the sanctions clause provided that jpmorgan must comply with us sanctions laws and regulations (termed as “applicable restrictions” in the sanctions clause), and that should documents be presented involving any vessel “listed in or otherwise subject to any applicable restriction”, jpmorgan would not be liable for any failure to pay.6 on or about 28 november 2019, kuvera made a complying presentation of documents through a presenting bank (the “presenting bank”) to jpmorgan under the lcs. the presentation of documents was for a value of us$2,422,111.07 (the “principal sum”). jpmorgan sent the presented documents for its internal sanctions screening procedure and found out that the vessel (the “omnia”) on which the coal had been shipped was included on a list internal to jpmorgan, which was known as the master list and contained the names of entities and vessels that had been determined by jpmorgan to have a sanctions nexus and/or concern. jpmorgan declined to pay kuvera and returned the documents to the presenting bank. 7 the lcs expired on 15 december 2019 and 16 december 2019 respectively. subsequently, following negotiations between kuvera, the issuing bank and the buyer, and a resulting memorandum of understanding (“mou”) dated 23 january 2020, the buyer paid kuvera us$2,204.042.74 (or uae dirham 8,096,000) in exchange for kuvera’s documents.decision on appeal8 a documentary credit transaction comprises a number of discrete contracts with each being autonomous and separate from the others: at [27].9 letters of credit and confirmations can be understood as unilateral contracts that bear the sui generis quality of irrevocability: at [35]–[36].10 in light of the independent and unilateral nature of a confirmation, the sanctions clause need not be separately offered or accepted and can simply be incorporated in the confirmations as was done in the present case: at [37].11 the question of whether a vessel was “subject to any applicable restriction” should be determined on an objective basis without third-party input from entities such as the us office of foreign assets control. the inquiry was directed at whether the omnia remained syrian-owned at all material times, which was quintessentially an issue capable of objective determination: at [43].12 there were two material time periods: 2015, when jpmorgan placed the vessel (then named the “lady mona”) on its master list, and 2019, when the vessel’s name was changed to the omnia under a new registered ownership: at [53].13 in 2015, the inquiry into the syrian connection of the lady mona was rightly directed at the shipowning/operating entities. jpmorgan had sufficiently established the lady mona’s syrian connection in 2015: at [54]–[55].14 while the evidential inquiry in the context of in rem jurisdiction may not be entirely applicable for the purpose of the present appeal, what is clear from the case law is that the ownership of a vessel and any change thereof is an issue capable of proof: at [61].15 jpmorgan had not displaced the prima facie inference of ownership arising from the registered non-syrian owner of the omnia in 2019: at [62].16 the judge had referred to the change of the vessel’s name and her registered ownership coupled with the absence of information about her beneficial owners. however, it was insufficient for jpmorgan to suggest that just because information on the vessel’s beneficial owner was not available, that there was some masking or concealment as regards the identity of her beneficial ownership. jpmorgan was required to demonstrate how, on the specific facts and circumstances of this case, such masking of the omnia’s true ownership was likely to have occurred. it was not uncommon for vessels from a flag of convenience registry to not provide information about the vessels’ beneficial ownership: at [63].17 similarly, the absence of information about the identity of the beneficial owners and/or the technical manager of omnia did not necessarily mean there was concealment of her beneficial ownership: at [64].18 the mere fact that the lady mona was properly regarded as a vessel under syrian beneficial ownership in 2015 did not invariably mean that she should still be regarded as such under her new registered ownership in 2019. this was an inquiry which must be separately undertaken. it appeared that none of the omnia’s shipowning/operating entities bore any syrian nexus in 2019: at [65].19 it was plainly insufficient for jpmorgan to rely on mr ali samin’s apparent involvement in the omnia’s technical manager and internal safety management code manager in 2017 to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the syrian beneficial ownership of the omnia had continued into 2019: at [66]–[67].20 in light of the inconclusive evidence before the court, jpmorgan’s decision based on its own risk-taking calculus to refuse payment to kuvera was not sufficient to establish that the omnia was subject to “any applicable restriction” under the sanctions clause, and it was not entitled to invoke the sanctions clause to deny payment to kuvera on a complying presentation of documents: at [68].21 it was strictly not necessary to consider here whether the sanctions clause was compatible with the commercial purpose of the confirmations. the question of whether sanctions clauses are incompatible with the nature of irrevocable documentary credit transactions remains an open and difficult one. it may be problematic for a bank to have it both ways by representing to a beneficiary that payment is conditioned only on a complying demand, but reserving the right to dishonour where it is unsure of its legal liabilities if it decides to pay: at [69] and [71].22 provisionally, a balance must be struck between preserving the autonomy of individual contracts within a documentary credit transaction (such that it is open to parties to insert conditions in each autonomous contract) and upholding the commercial viability of a documentary credit transaction, whereby each autonomous contract is intended to correspond to and/or provide a safety net for the other contracts in the transaction: at [77].23 if the sanctions clause was to be construed as jpmorgan claimed it should, then the sanctions clause would most likely be incompatible with the commercial purpose of the confirmations due to the significant unpredictability such an interpretation would introduce into the confirmations: at [78].24 with respect to the issue of damages, it was no longer tenable for kuvera to maintain its claim for the principal sum given its receipt of payment under the mou. it was only able to maintain at best its claim for the sum of us$218,068.33 (the “balance sum”), which was the difference between the principal sum and the sum paid under the mou: at [79]–[80].25 as was recorded in the mou, three sums had been deducted from the balance sum. kuvera was not entitled to claim for the first sum of us$123,344.20 relating to credit due to the buyer from the seller, as kuvera would be required to pay the buyer this sum if it had received the principal sum from jpmorgan. the second sum of us$8,893.96 was levied by jpmorgan for acting as the confirming bank. the evidence as to whether kuvera would have had to repay this sum to the buyer had jpmorgan paid kuvera under the lcs was not entirely satisfactory, and hence kuvera’s claim for the sum of us$8,893.96 was allowed. finally, kuvera had agreed to accept us$2,200,000 in settlement from the buyer although the total amount due to kuvera was us$2,289,892.91. in the circumstances, kuvera’s claim for the discount of $89,892.91 was allowed: at [81]–[86].26 but for jpmorgan’s non-payment under the two confirmations, there would be no need to negotiate any settlement with the buyer or issuing bank. kuvera’s claim of s$11,429.32 for travel and accommodation expenses incurred to negotiate the mou and to deliver documents pursuant to the mou, and to attempt to present the documents to the presenting bank and the issuing bank, was allowed: at [87].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the
