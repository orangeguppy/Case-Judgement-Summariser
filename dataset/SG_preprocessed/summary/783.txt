15/2022)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the appellate division of the high court (delivered by judge of the appellate division woo bih li):outcome: ad allows application to strike out notice of appeal. pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  where there were multiple decisions rendered on different dates in relation to the same case (eg, the first on liability and the second on costs), and a party wished to extract one judgment, the extracted judgment ought to reflect accurately each of the dates on which the respective decisions were made, if it was permissible to extract one judgment. if that was not permissible, then two orders for each decision should have been extracted.•  an appeal against a decision of a lower court made in proceedings to which the revoked rules of court (2014 rev ed) apply must be filed within one month after the date on which that judgment or order appealed against was pronounced.1 ad/sum 15/2022 (“sum 15”) was an application to strike out the notice of appeal filed in ad/ca 39/2022 (“na 39”). na 39 was against the “whole of the decision” of the high court judge (the “judge”) “given on 16-03-2022” in hc/s 1044/2018 and hc/s 1307/2018 respectively (collectively, the “suits”). the parties who filed sum 15 are collectively referred to as the “customers” and the parties opposing sum 15 are collectively referred to as the “companies”.background and material facts2 the customers were holiday makers who were travelling from genting highlands back to singapore on 31 august 2016. they were on board a double decker luxury coach (the “bus”). en route to singapore, the bus was involved in a road accident. the customers sustained injuries and filed an action to claim damages.3 on 24 february 2022, the judge gave interlocutory judgment on liability in favour of the customers with damages to be assessed (including damages in relation to the companies’ contractual liability to all the customers for failing to provide the transportation service with reasonable care) and costs to be heard separately in r manokaran and others v chuah ah leng and others and another suit [2022] sghc 39 (the “main judgment”). on 16 march 2022, the judge made orders on costs and disbursements against the companies by way of correspondence from the court (the “costs orders”). 4 on 12 april 2022, the companies filed na 39 which was not the companies’ first attempt to file an appeal against the main judgment. on 24 march 2022, counsel for the companies first attempted to file a purported “appeal” which was rejected by the general division of the high court. on 25 march 2022, the companies filed a notice of appeal to the court of appeal. that was also procedurally deficient for several reasons, including that it was filed out of time as 24 march 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal against the main judgment. however, when filing the notice of appeal to the court of appeal, the solicitors for the companies indicated that an extension of time was not required.5 on 30 march 2022, the registry responded, asking counsel for the companies to confirm whether the notice of appeal to the court of appeal was filed out of time as that appeared to be the case. on 31 march 2022, counsel for the companies wrote to the registry, stating that the appeal was “not out of time”. at a case management conference (“cmc”) on 7 april 2022, the assistant registrar (“ar”) said that the notice of appeal would be rejected due to numerous deficiencies. the ar also mentioned that counsel for the companies ought to consider whether an application for an extension of time to appeal should be filed. the customers had indicated that they might apply to strike out the appeal, if counsel for the companies sought to file an appeal without an extension of time. 6 eventually, the companies filed na 39 on 12 april 2022 before the appellate division of the high court without seeking an extension of time to do so.the parties’ cases7 the customers contended that because na 39 referred only to the decision of the judge on 16 march 2022, it is an appeal against the costs orders only. as such, it may be filed only with the court’s permission to do so. if the companies wished to appeal against the main judgment on liability, which was pronounced on 24 february 2022, they might do so only if an extension of time to appeal was obtained. as neither permission to appeal against the costs orders nor an extension of time to appeal against the main judgment was sought, na 39 should be struck out.8 the companies contended that na 39 was “against the whole of” the judge’s decision in respect of liability and costs. such appeal was filed within time as the relevant time began running only when the judge had resolved all issues, including costs. as such, the relevant time only ran from 16 march 2022 when the costs orders were made. sum 15 should accordingly be dismissed.decision on appeal9 it was clear that two different decisions were rendered on two different dates. the first is the main judgment, which was pronounced on 24 february 2022, in respect of the companies’ liability. the second is the costs orders which were made on 16 march 2022 (at [17]).10 the customers were wrong to have extracted a single judgment in respect of liability and costs in each of the suits without mentioning the two different dates. where there were multiple decisions rendered on different dates in relation to the same case (eg, the first on liability and the second on costs), the extracted judgment ought to reflect accurately each of the dates on which the respective decisions were made, if that was permissible. if that was not permissible, then two orders for each of the suits should have been extracted. the customers’ error, however, did not and could not change the relevant date for the purposes of determining the time within which a notice of appeal might be filed (at [18]–[19]).11 the phrase “against the whole of the decision” in na 39 is not to be read in isolation. it is to be read in its proper context – which, in this case, is the judge’s decision “given on 16-03-2022”. in this regard, it is clear based on the court’s correspondence dated 16 march 2022, that the judge’s decisions in each of the suits on that date related to costs only. read in totality, na 39 is an appeal against the whole of the judge’s decision on costs only (ie, on every aspect of the costs orders) but not on the judge’s decision in respect of liability (at [22]).12 the fact that the customers’ extracted judgments filed on 4 april 2022 stated that the “date of judgment” was “16-march-2022” was immaterial. rather, it was the actual date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced that was material. to this end, the extracted judgment did not and could not change the date on which the judgment in respect of liability was in fact pronounced by the judge (ie, 24 february 2022) (at [20] and [23]).13 where the costs orders were made both (a) before a notice of appeal was filed and (b) prior to the expiry of the period limited for filing a notice of appeal against the main judgment, the companies ought to have filed a single notice of appeal. had the companies followed the correct procedure, permission to appeal would not be required since the notice of appeal would relate to both the main judgment and the costs orders and not just the costs orders only (at [25] and [26]).14 under o 1 r 2 of the rules of court 2021 (the “rules of court 2021”), an appeal against a decision of a lower court made in proceedings to which the revoked rules of court (2014 rev ed) apply must be filed within one month after the date on which that judgment or order appealed against was pronounced. the companies’ reliance on o 19 r 4 of the rules of court 2021 was somewhat misplaced and arose from a misunderstanding of the transitional provisions and application of the rules of court 2021 as stipulated in o 1 r 2 (at [32]–[34]).15 the time to appeal against the main judgment started to run from 24 february 2022 and not 16 march 2022 as the companies contended. therefore, even if na 39 was against the main judgment in addition to the costs orders (as the companies contended), it was filed out of time. as no such extension of time was sought and obtained by the companies, na 39 ought to be struck out (at [35]–[36]). this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s
