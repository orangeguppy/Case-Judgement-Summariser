supreme court of singapore29 september 2022case summaryabc v public prosecutor [2022] sghc 244general division of the high court – magistrate’s appeal no 9019 of 2022/01---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the general division of the high court (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon):outcome: hc allowed the appeal against sentence for an offence under s 376 of the penal code where the victim is a consenting minor below the age of 14. pertinent and significant point of the judgment:•  no substantive change in policy was effected by the 2019 amendments to the penal code in relation to victims under the age of 14 who consented to acts of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 and s 376a: at [37].•  the sentencing framework in pram nair v public prosecutor [2017] 2 slr 1015 (“pram nair”) should apply to cases that are sentenced under s 376a(3) and those under s 376(3), but not to cases that are sentenced under s 376(4) or s 376a(2)(b): at [38].•  the court left open the question whether pram nair applies to other forms of penile-vaginal penetration and proffered the provisional view that it would not apply to penile-vaginal penetration which could be prosecuted under s 376a(1)(a), instead of as rape: at [43].•  the court found that it would be appropriate to invoke the doctrine of prospective overruling as there would be serious and demonstrable injustice if the sentence of six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was maintained in this case: at [62].background to the appeal1 the appellant was 28 years old at the relevant time and volunteered as a facilitator for certain children’s classes at a religious organisation. the victim and her family were members there and two of her siblings attended the class that was facilitated by the appellant. the appellant first met the victim sometime in early 2020 when the victim picked her siblings up after their classes. the relationship between the appellant and the victim started to develop when the victim also started volunteering with the religious organisation. soon after, the two started meeting and developed a relationship which they kept from others.2 in or around february 2020, the appellant and the victim would meet a few times a week at a shopping centre and would then go to the staircase landing of a block of flats where they talked, kissed and hugged. by march 2020, the appellant began touching the victim’s private parts in the course of these interactions. he first touched the victim’s breasts over her clothes and then progressed to touching her breasts under her clothes on a subsequent occasion. on a third occasion, the appellant touched the victim’s breasts under her clothes and touched her vagina over her clothes. he eventually progressed to digitally penetrating the victim, with one finger on the first occasion and with two fingers on the next occasion. the appellant was aware that the victim was between 13 and 14 years old at the relevant time. 3 the appellant also requested nude videos of the victim. the victim complied and between march and june 2020, she sent videos and photographs of herself in various states of undress and/or masturbating. the appellant was arrested after the victim’s mother checked the victim’s phone and lodged a police report.4 the appellant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the offence of sexual assault by penetration (“sap”) of a minor below the age of 14 pursuant to s 376(2)(a) and punishable under s 376(3) of the penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed) (“penal code”). he also consented to six other charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.5 the learned district judge (the “district judge”) applied the sentencing framework set out in pram nair v public prosecutor [2017] 2 slr 1015 (“pram nair”) and placed the case within band 1 of pram nair, which prescribed a sentencing range between seven and ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, the judge sentenced the appellant to six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.the apparent complexity in this appeal and the questions to be answered6 the apparent complexity in the present case arises in part from the fact that there had been certain legislative changes in 2019 that pertained to a number of sexual offences including sap. the appellant contended that because of those legislative amendments in 2019 (the “2019 amendments”) sentencing precedents that preceded those amendments, including pram nair, could not be applied without careful consideration of how the 2019 amendments might affect the law in this area. his contention was that pram nair was a precedent that applied only in cases where the victim had not consented to the sap. where there was such consent, even in the case of a minor, the position, according to him, was that pram nair did not apply. he maintained that this was not displaced by the 2019 amendments: at [3].7 in reaching its decision, the court had to consider the following (at [7]):a. did the 2019 amendments effect any substantive changes to the offence in question?b. do the cases cited by the appellant show that pram nair has not been applied in cases involving offences where the victim consented?c. if the answer to (a) is “no” and the answer to (b) is “yes”, should the doctrine of prospective overruling be invoked?decision of the courtthe effect of the 2019 amendments8 the court observed that no substantive change was brought about by the amendments that is material to this case. the 2019 amendments removed various anomalies within ss 376 and 376a through the inclusion of s 376a(1a). none of the anomalies were relevant to the present case because the victim here was below 14 years old and consented: at [33] and [35].9 before the 2019 amendments, where a victim under the age of 14 consented, the accused person could only be charged under s 376a(1)(b), which carried a maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment and the possibility of a fine or caning. after the 2019 amendments, where a victim under the age of 14 has consented to sap, the accused person may be charged under either s 376(2)(a) or s 376a(1)(b), both of which carry the same maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment, with the possibility of a fine or caning pursuant to s 376(3) and s 376a(3) respectively. the regime for victims below the age of 14 is the same now as it was before save that where there is no consent, the charge cannot proceed under s 376a(1)(b): at [34] and [35].the applicability of pram nair and the relevance of precedents under s 376a(3)10 as no substantive change in policy was effected by the 2019 amendments in relation to victims under the age of 14 who consented to acts of sap, it follows that cases that were decided in respect of s 376a(3) would generally be relevant: at [37].11 the court held that following the 2019 amendments, the same sentencing framework should apply to cases that are sentenced under s 376a(3) and those under s 376(3), but not to cases that are sentenced under s 376(4) or s 376a(2)(b): at [38].12 the court explained that there are three categories of cases:a. category 1: cases of sap where the victims are under the age of 14 but consent to the acts of sap; and cases where the victims are over the age of 14 (including adult victims) but who do not consent: at [39].b. category 2: cases where the victims are under the age of 14 and do not consent (or where other aggravating factors in s 376(4) are present), and these are subject to a mandatory minimum punishment under s 376(4) but are otherwise subject to the same maximum punishment as category 1 cases: at [40(a)].c. category 3: cases where the victims are between the ages of 14 and 16 and consent to the acts of sap. these are subject to a different punishment regime under s 376a(2)(b), namely imprisonment for a maximum term of ten years or a fine or both, but not of caning: at [40(b)].13 the pram nair framework should apply to all offences that are to be sentenced under s 376(3) and also to those under s 376a(3). however, the court left open the question whether pram nair applies to other forms of penile-vaginal penetration and proffered the provisional view that it would not apply to penile-vaginal penetration which could be prosecuted under s 376a(1)(a), instead of as rape: at [42], [43], [46] and [48].14 the court observed that it is clear from previous cases that pram nair has not generally been applied to cases that were sentenced under s 376a(3). the sentences imposed in these cases are typically less than four years’ imprisonment with no caning. there is a gross discrepancy between the sentences that have been imposed in cases under s 376a(3) cases and that of the appellant: at [55] and [57].prospective overruling15 the court held that it would be appropriate to invoke the doctrine of prospective overruling. there would be serious and demonstrable injustice if the sentence of six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was maintained in this case. the overwhelming majority of the cases under s 376a(3) resulted in sentences below four years’ imprisonment with no caning. the entrenched legal position is therefore that pram nair has mistakenly not been applied to s 376a(3) cases and the sentences are consequently much lower than would be the case if pram nair were to apply. further, the difference between the position under pram nair and that which has applied to cases under s 376a(3) is very substantial: at [61] and [62].16 in light of the considerable disparity, the fair and just outcome would be to overrule the line of cases that have failed to apply pram nair to cases under either s 376a(3) or s 376(3), but to do so prospectively: at [63].the appropriate sentence17 if pram nair were applied to the present case, there would be no merit in the appeal because on that footing, the sentence of six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane could not be said to be manifestly excessive: at [64].18 however, the court noted that having regard to the way the settled approach to sentencing in these cases appear to have been approached, a sentence of three years and six months’ imprisonment with no caning would be appropriate: at [65].this summary is provided to assist in the
