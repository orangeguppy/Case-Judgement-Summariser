and (b) the court must decide the matter on the merits, balancing the public interest and the rights of the accused person: at [24], [25].6 given that a data completely clears an accused person of the offence with which he was charged without a trial, it will not generally be appropriate where an accused person has been charged, there is no clarity as to his guilt or innocence, and there is some basis for thinking that he is involved in the matter. in most cases, a dnata strikes an obvious balance in that it allows the state to revive the proceedings if and when it is able to pursue the prosecution, while the accused person is freed of at least of some of the restrictions that come with having been charged, including very onerous ones such as being held in remand where the offence is a non-bailable one. it is for these reasons that the presumptive position is that the court’s discretion will lie in favour of ordering a dnata: at [28], [30].7 the presumptive position will be stronger where the charge is for a serious offence, where there is no uncertainty about when the prosecution will complete its investigations, or where the accused person has wrongfully contributed to the prosecution’s difficulty in proceeding with the matter: at [31].8 the presumptive position may be displaced where there is no real or reasonable prospect of a prosecution occurring in the future, or where there are grounds to suggest that the charge should not have been brought at all. in assessing the prospect of a future prosecution, the court is not required to make an objective assessment of the prosecution’s intended investigative efforts. a confirmation from the prosecution that it is pursuing live leads and has reason to believe its investigations will bear fruit should suffice: at [33], [41].9 any past prejudice caused to the accused person, whether it is the prosecution’s fault or not, will not typically be relevant: at [39] and [40].10 in the present case, the offence involved was murder. the seriousness of the offence strengthened the presumptive position that a dnata was appropriate. while the offence did take place some 16 or so years ago, the appellant lied about his involvement when first interviewed by the police in 2007. any delay was, in a sense, a problem of his own making: at [43], [44].11 at the hearing of the appeal, the prosecution confirmed that: (a) in its present view, mr ragil’s evidence was necessary to enable the charge to be prosecuted against the appellant; (b) in the absence of mr ragil’s further assistance, its position at present was that it would not proceed with the charge against the appellant based on such evidence as it had been able to obtain; (c) there was reason to believe that mr ragil was in indonesia; and (d) efforts were underway to locate mr ragil and to enable the singapore authorities to secure his further assistance. in these circumstances, it seemed that the prosecution was pursuing a live lead: at [20], [45].12 this was not a case where there was no basis for the charge in the first place. the past hardship to the appellant and his family was not relevant and alleged inefficiency of the prosecution’s investigations carried no weight. given the very strong public interest in enabling the investigations to be completed, in all the circumstances of the case, the court was satisfied that the dj had struck the balance correctly when he granted a dnata: at [47], [48], [49].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
