----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of the high court (delivered by judicial commissioner andre maniam):
outcome: the court dismisses the appeal against the striking out of hc/os 1595/2019 and grants an extended civil restraint order, pursuant to s 73c of the scja, against the defendant in hc/os 490/2020. 
 
background
1 mr joseph clement louis arokaisamy (“mr clement”) was a former employee of singapore airlines limited (“sia”) until his dismissal in 1997. he sued sia for wrongful dismissal in dc/s 4929/1997 but his claim was dismissed by district judge valerie thean (as she then was) in 2003. in 2004, his appeal to the high court was dismissed by woo bih li j and the court of appeal refused to grant him leave to appeal thereafter.           
2 notwithstanding that the dismissal of mr clement’s claim had become final and unappealable in 2004, he continued initiating various actions and applications concerning his termination to date. his latest application against sia was hc/os 1595/2019 (“os 1595”) in which he sought an interpretation of s 13(2) of the employment act (cap 91, 1996 rev ed) (“employment act”) and other relief, and which he contended was neither a re-litigation of dc/s 4929/1997 nor barred by res judicata. sia successfully applied to strike out os 1595.
3 hc/ra 87/2020 was mr clement’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s decision to strike out os 1595. sia filed hc/os 490/2020 (the “restraint os”) to indefinitely restrain mr clement from further re-litigating his wrongful dismissal claim without leave of court, pursuant to s 73c of the supreme court of judicature act (cap 322, 2007 rev ed) (“scja”) and/or the court’s inherent powers.
 
the court’s grounds of decision
4 the court held that the assistant registrar was correct to strike out os 1595 (at [11]). os 1595, which was another attempt by mr clement to reopen dc/s 4929/1997, was barred by res judicata in the sense of cause of action estoppel (at [12], [13] and [15]). furthermore, in deciding against mr clement, both district judge thean and woo j had not only interpreted s 13(2) of the employment act but had also found it to be applicable to the facts of his wrongful dismissal claim (at [12], [14], [15] and [21]). 
5 mr clement’s reference to s 8 of the employment act in os 1595 was caught by cause of action estoppel and/or the “extended” doctrine of res judicata (at [16]–[17]). in any event, s 8 of the employment act was irrelevant since mr clement’s real gripe was with s 13(2) of the same act rather than any term in his employment contract (at [20]).
6 the court found that mr clement’s new grounds for re-litigating dc/s 4929/1997 all offended res judicata and were totally without merit (at [24]). first, he had no basis for claiming that sia knew they were not entitled to rely on s 13(2) of the employment act; there was also no fraud as the judges had simply agreed with sia that s 13(2) of the employment act justified his termination (at [25]). second, district judge thean had all the powers she needed to dismiss his wrongful dismissal claim on the basis that his termination was justified by s 13(2) of the employment act (at [26]). third, there was no procedural impropriety; moreover, the high court had dismissed the appeal against district judge thean’s decision (at [27]). 
7 moreover, os 1595 was time-barred and had been commenced with undue delay (at [28] and [32]). section 29(1) of the limitation act (cap 163, 1996 rev ed) did not apply on the facts, but even if it did, os 1595 would still have been brought well outside of the relevant limitation period (at [29]–[31]).
8 as for the restraint os, mr clement had, to date, brought four actions or applications that were totally without merit (at [36]). the court was therefore satisfied that he had “persistently commenced actions or made applications that are totally without merit’ within s 73c(1) of the scja (at [35]). 
9 notwithstanding that s 73c of the scja only came into force on 1 january 2019, neither the language of the section nor its legislative purpose limited the court to considering only conduct after that date (at [37]). in any event, even if mr clement’s conduct prior to 2019 could not be taken into account for the purposes of s 73c of the scja, an extended civil restraint order against him could be justified as an exercise of the court’s inherent powers (at [38]).   
10 since s 73c(4) of the scja expressly provided for extended civil restraint orders to take effect for a period of two years, a restraint of indefinite length could only be granted pursuant to an exercise of the court’s inherent powers (at [44]). the word “persistently” in s 73c(1) of the scja indicated that more than one unmeritorious action or application would have to be brought before s 73c of the scja came into operation, yet parliament had expressly provided for a two-year limit in extended civil restraint orders per s 73c(4) of the scja (at [43]). the mere fact that mr clement had brought four actions or applications that were totally without merit did not justify an indefinite restraint against him (at [43]). furthermore, the court’s inherent powers should be invoked sparingly, especially where a party urged the court to invoke its inherent powers to circumvent an existing rule (at [44]). the court decided against exercising its inherent powers to grant an indefinite restraint against mr clement as doing so would result in an outcome that was more onerous to him than that provided for under s 73c(4) of the scja (at [44]). 
11 accordingly, the court ordered a two-year restraint against mr clement on the basis of s 73c of the scja rather than its inherent powers, unless those powers were necessary for the order made (at [40], [44] and [45]).
