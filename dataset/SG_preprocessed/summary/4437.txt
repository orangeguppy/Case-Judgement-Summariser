decision

of the high court (sundaresh menon cj):
pertinent and significant points of the

judgment
·    


the high court set out a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 172a(2) of the casino control act (cap 33a, 2007 rev ed).


applying the new sentencing framework, the appellant’s aggregate sentence was reduced from 45 months’ imprisonment to 38 months’ imprisonment on appeal.



1               this

was an appeal against sentence.

background

to the appeal
2               the

appellant (“the appellant”) was a russian who was 40 years old at the material

time. he pleaded guilty to one charge under s 172a(1)(c) of the casino control act (cap 33a, 2007 rev ed) (“the

cca”) and five charges under s 172a(1)(c)

read with s 172a(3) of the cca, all of which were punishable under s 172a(2)

of the cca. ten charges under s 172a(1)(c) read with s 172a(3) and punishable under s 172a(2) of

the cca were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. the appellant

was sentenced by the district judge (“the district judge”) to an aggregate term

of 45 months’ imprisonment. this appeal, magistrate’s appeal no 9133

of 2017, was his appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the district

judge.
3               the

appellant was charged along with two of his accomplices: skubnik radoslav

(“skubnik”), a czech who was 40 years old at the material time, and egorov

andrei (“egorov”), a russian who was 33 years old at the material time.

material

facts
4      the

appellant was part of a russian syndicate operating in casinos in the united

states, europe and macau. the syndicate targeted slot machines made by certain

manufacturers. syndicate members would form teams comprising a “master” (who

was the team leader) and “players”. they would use smartphone devices to record

the play patterns of the slot machines in question. the “master” would then

upload the recorded information to a server for analysis and decoding. the

decoded data enabled the syndicate members to predict, with some degree of

accuracy, the future outcomes of play on the targeted slot machines. 
5               the

decoded data would be sent to the “master”, who in turn would distribute this

to the “players”. the “players” would then return to the same slot machines,

and the smartphone devices would alert them ahead of the next mass payout,

thereby enabling them to win at those slot machines between 60 and 65% of the

time.
6               in

march 2016, the appellant made arrangements for some syndicate members to

travel to singapore. these syndicate members proceeded to record the play

patterns on specific slot machines at the casinos at marina bay sands (“mbs”)

and resorts world sentosa (“rws”). these recordings were then analysed, and the

analysed data was given to the appellant while he was in russia.
7               the

appellant taught skubnik and egorov how to use the smartphone devices. in april

2016, the appellant instructed skubnik to go to singapore with the smartphone

devices and use them in the casinos here. he also told skubnik that he would be

travelling to singapore for this job. separately, he informed egorov of the

same. 
8               the

trio arrived in singapore on 5 may 2016. the appellant was the “master”

for this job. he provided skubnik and egorov with the analysed data (which was

stored in a computer). together, they visited the casinos at mbs and rws and

identified the compromised slot machines. they then used the smartphone devices

and gained an advantage when playing at these slot machines. in accordance with

their agreement, skubnik and egorov would each receive about 10% of the

winnings, while the appellant would receive about 15 to 20%. the balance would

go to the syndicate. the offences were committed between 5 and 8 may 2016.
9               skubnik

was the first to be dealt with. he was sentenced by another district judge to

an aggregate sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment. egorov was sentenced together

with the appellant by the district judge. egorov received an aggregate sentence

of 30 months’ imprisonment. 
10             on

appeal, the appellant submitted that an aggregate sentence of not more than

24 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in this case. the respondent,

on the other hand, submitted that the sentence imposed by the district judge

was not manifestly excessive.

the

applicable sentencing framework and the decision on appeal
11      each

party sought, at least initially, to build its case primarily by relying on and

distinguishing such sentencing precedents as were available. however, the court

did not think that any of the cases relied on by the parties provided any

reliable reference points for determining the appropriate sentence to impose on

the appellant. in the court’s view, the present appeal was not one that could

be disposed of merely by looking at the sentences imposed in the available

sentencing precedents. rather, the court considered it necessary to approach

the matter from first principles. in this context, it was also necessary to

consider where the present case lay along the sentencing continuum provided for

under s 172a(2) of the cca. (at [28],

[32] and [33])
12             to

this end, the court identified some of the relevant sentencing considerations

in the context of offences punishable under s 172a(2) of the cca as

follows: (at [37])







offence-specific

            factors

13             in its written judgment, the court

proposed a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 172a(2) of

the cca. this framework comprised five steps.
14             the first step was to have regard

to the offence-specific factors and identify: (a) the level of harm caused

by the offence; and (b) the level of the offender’s culpability. the harm

caused by the offence might be categorised into one of three levels: slight,

moderate or severe. similarly, the offender’s culpability might be categorised

into one of three levels: low, medium or high. in the court’s judgment, the

level of harm caused in this case was moderate, while the level of the

appellant’s culpability was medium. (at [76],

[77], [90] and [98])
15             once the sentencing court had identified

the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s

culpability, the second step was to identify the applicable indicative

sentencing range. having regard to the sentencing range stipulated in s 172a(2)

of the cca, the court considered the indicative sentencing ranges in the

following matrix to be appropriate: (at [78])


16      in the present case, the applicable

indicative sentencing range would be one to three years’ (or 12 to 36 months’)

imprisonment. (at [99])
17             after identifying the indicative

sentencing range, the third step was to identify the appropriate

starting point within that range. this was to be done with regard, once again,

to: (a) the level of harm caused by the offence; and (b) the level of

the offender’s culpability. in the court’s judgment, the appellant’s sentences

should fall at the lower to middle level of the indicative sentencing range.

accordingly, the court identified the appropriate starting points within this

range as follows: (at [79] and [100])






sn

dac 919380/2016

18 months’ imprisonment




4


dac 919385/2016


$18,982.50


20 months’ imprisonment




5


dac 919392/2016


$14,573.00


18 months’ imprisonment




6


dac 919395/2016


$21,774.45


22 months’ imprisonment






18             once an appropriate starting point

within the indicative sentencing range had been identified, the fourth step

was to make such adjustments to the starting point as might be necessary to

take into account the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors. in

the court’s judgment, no further adjustments were required at the fourth step

in the present case. (at [80] and [105])
19             in cases where an offender was convicted

of multiple charges, the fifth step was to consider the need to make

further adjustments to take into account the totality principle. this applied

especially where an offender was punished with three or more sentences of

imprisonment, in which case s 307(1) of the criminal procedure code

(cap 68, 2012 rev ed) mandated that at least two of the sentences had

to run consecutively. in such situations, further adjustments to the individual

sentences imposed on the offender might be required so as to ensure that the

aggregate sentence was not excessive. (at [81])
20             the court did not think it was necessary

or appropriate to order more than two sentences to run consecutively in the

present case. in the court’s judgment, it would be appropriate to order, as the

district judge did, the sentence for dac 919377/2016 and the sentence for

dac 919395/2016 to run consecutively. this would result in a provisional

aggregate sentence of 46 months’ imprisonment. this struck the court as

possibly excessively high because it was almost double the longest individual

sentence imposed on the appellant (namely, 24 months’ imprisonment for dac 919377/2016).

(at [108] and [109])
21      having regard to the overall criminality

involved, the court thought that the aggregate sentence should be reduced in

this case. in the final analysis, the totality principle was a manifestation of

the requirement of proportionality. in the court’s judgment, a term of 38 months’

imprisonment would serve this end. the court therefore reduced the individual sentences

for dac 919377/2016 and dac 919395/2016 to 20 months’ and 18 months’

imprisonment respectively. (at [110])
22             in the circumstances, the court set

aside the individual and aggregate sentences imposed by the district judge, and

imposed instead the following individual sentences on the appellant: (at [111])

6

23        the court ordered the sentences for dac 919377/2016 and dac 919395/2016 to run consecutively, making an aggregate sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment. the appellant’s appeal was thus allowed in this regard. the court did not disturb the district judge’s order that the sentence was to take effect from 10 may 2016.
