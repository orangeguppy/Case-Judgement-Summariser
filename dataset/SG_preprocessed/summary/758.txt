(b) inter-spousal gifts where the subject matter of the gifts was originally acquired by way of a third-party gift or inheritance. such gifts are inter-spousal re-gifts which are not matrimonial assets; and (c) inter-spousal gifts where the subject matter of the gifts was acquired prior to marriage. such gifts would not be matrimonial assets as they had not been obtained with any effort expended by the donor spouse during the marriage: at [46]. 1 this was an appeal by a husband against part of the decision of the gd on the division of matrimonial assets. background to the appeal2 the husband (“h”) and wife (“w”) were married for 17 years. h was a successful businessman, and w was a homemaker. the sole issue before the high court was the division of matrimonial assets, and the present appeal relates to the following three assets: (a) a property at tanglin park (“r1”); (b) 175,000 shares in a family company lb; (c) 50,000 shares in a family company j.  facts/ the material facts3 r1 was purchased by h prior to marriage. however, as the mortgage for r1 was paid off in full during the marriage and the family had used r1 for five years during the marriage, the high court judge (the “judge”) held that r1 was a matrimonial asset.  4 lb is a company incorporated by h’s father. h received 223,400 lb shares prior to marriage. in 2003, h transferred 148,400 lb shares to various family members (including w). in 2007, 175,000 lb shares were transferred  to him. the signed share transfer forms for the transfers in 2003 and 2007 showed a consideration of $1 per share. there were also certificates of stamp duty in 2003, and adjudication of stamp duty certificates in 2007. the judge held that consideration had been paid for the lb share transfers in 2003 and 2007. accordingly, as h had acquired 175,000 lb shares in 2007 during the marriage, these shares were included in the pool of matrimonial assets. 5 j is a company incorporated by h’s father. h had held 222,514 j shares prior to marriage. in 2003, h had transferred 147,514 shares to various family members (including w). in 2005 and 2007, 175,000 j shares were transferred to him. at the time of interim judgment (“ij”), h held 50,000 j shares. the register of transfers showed that the consideration for each share which was transferred in 2003, 2005 and 2007 was $1 was paid in respect of each of the transfers. the judge held that h had acquired 175,000 j shares during the marriage for consideration. as h held 50,000 j shares in 2007 and failed to prove at the time of interlocutory judgment that the shares he still had were traceable to his original pre-marital assets, the judge included the 50,000 j shares in the pool of matrimonial assets. 6 the judge divided the pool of matrimonial assets, valued at $53,485,931, 30:70 in h’s favour. this was h’s appeal against: (a) the inclusion of the 175,000 lb shares, 50,000 j shares in the matrimonial pool; (b) the inclusion of the entire value of r1 in the matrimonial pool; and (c) the judge’s decision to divide the matrimonial pool in the ratio of 30:70 in favour of h. the court’s decision on appeal7 while the parties accepted that the signed share transfer forms, certificates of stamp duty and certificates of adjudication of stamp duty for the transfer of lb shares had indicated that consideration was paid, this was only prima facie evidence that consideration had in fact been paid for each transfer. the affidavit evidence from h’s accountant (“the accountant”) stated that the lb shares had been transferred for the purpose of tax planning and without consideration. this was not challenged by w. neither did she assert that consideration was in fact paid. in the circumstances, the judge had erred in finding that consideration was in fact paid for the transfer of lb shares in 2003 and 2007: at [29] and [30].8 h did not claim that he had retained a beneficial interest in the lb shares that he had transferred in 2003. the evidence of the accountant and of the signed share transfer forms, stamp duty certificates and certificates of adjudication of stamp duty showed that the beneficial interest in the lb shares had been passed with the transfer of legal title. accordingly, the transfers of lb shares in 2003 and 2007 which were for no consideration should be properly construed as gifts: at [34] and [35]. 9 similarly, for the j shares which were transferred in 2003, 2005, and 2007, as no consideration was in fact paid for the share transfers. h did not claim that he retained a beneficial interest in the j shares after he transferred them in 2003. the evidence of the accountant and the documentary evidence indicated that beneficial interest had passed with the transfer of legal title. these transactions should be properly construed as gifts: at [62].10 in general there are three types of inter-spousal gifts: (a) “pure” inter-spousal gifts where the subject matter of the gifts was acquired during marriage by the effort of one or both spouses. such gifts are matrimonial assets under s 112(10)(b) of the women’s charter (cap 353, 2009 rev ed) (“women’s charter); (b) inter-spousal gifts where the subject matter of the gifts was originally acquired by way of a third-party gift or inheritance. such gifts would be considered inter-spousal re-gifts which are not matrimonial assets; and (c) inter-spousal gifts where the subject matter of the gifts was acquired prior to marriage. such gifts would not be matrimonial assets as they had not been obtained with any effort expended by the donor spouse during the marriage: at [46]. 11 the gift of 87,500 lb shares from h to w in 2003 and from w to h in 2007 were inter-spousal gifts. if it is accepted that the lb shares h held prior to marriage originated as gifts from third-parties, the gift of 87,500 lb shares between parties would be an inter-spousal re-gift which was not a matrimonial asset. accordingly, the 87,500 lb shares which were gifted back to h from w was not a matrimonial asset: at [47]. 12 in the alternative, if the lb shares h held prior to marriage had been acquired by h prior to marriage by his own effort, the 87,500 lb shares he gifted to w in 2003 would not be considered a “pure” inter-spousal gift as h had not acquired the shares during the marriage. this was a gift of non-matrimonial assets, and when the shares were subsequently gifted back to h, they remained as non-matrimonial assets: at [48]. 13 the 87,500 j shares h had transferred to w in 2003 and w had transferred back to h in 2005 were inter-spousal gifts. as the j shares h held prior to marriage were prima facie non-matrimonial assets, the subsequent transfer of the 87,500 j shares from h to w was a gift of a non-matrimonial asset. when these 87,500 j shares were then subsequently gifted back to h by w for no consideration, they remained as non-matrimonial assets: at [64].14 as for the lb and j shares h had transferred to his family members in 2003, these were gifts of non-matrimonial assets. when he subsequently received the 87,500 lb shares and 87,500 j shares from family members in 2007, these were third-party gifts which h received during marriage: at [50] and [63]. 15 w did not assert that any of the lb or j shares had been transformed by substantial improvement or ordinarily used for family purpose: at [49].  16 in summary, the 175,000 lb shares h received in 2007 and the 50,000 j shares h still holds are not matrimonial assets: at [51] and [65]. 17 as for r1, the judge had already considered the fact that r1 was partially acquired by h prior to marriage but took into account other factors like the fact that the mortgage was paid off in full during the marriage and the family had used r1 for five years during the marriage. there was no basis to vary her decision to include the entire value of r1 as a matrimonial asset: at [71] to [72]. 18 as for the division of the matrimonial pool, h failed to show that the judge was plainly wrong in ordering the division 30:70 in favour of h: at [77] to [82].  this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
