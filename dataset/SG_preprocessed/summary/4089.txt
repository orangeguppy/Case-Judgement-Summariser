civil appeal no 159 of 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by judge of appeal steven chong):
outcome: coa departs from earlier authority, holding that in determining whether to grant a stay of proceedings to give effect to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the merits of any defence the applicant for the stay intends to raise are irrelevant.
pertinent and significant points of the judgment

the court of appeal restates the law governing an application for a stay of proceedings based on an exclusive jurisdiction clause (an “ejc application”), and departs from the jian he [1999] 3 slr(r) 432 and cases following that authority in holding that the merits of the applicant’s defence are irrelevant in an ejc application (at [112]–[113]).

 

the court of appeal leaves open the extent to which its restatement of the law applies to jurisdiction clauses in bills of lading and standard form contracts that the plaintiff was not in a position to negotiate (at [138]).

 

the court of appeal expounds on the test of a “good arguable case” in the context of an ejc application (at [45]–[46]) and the law on incorporation by a course of dealings (at [53]–[58]). 

background to the appeal
1          this was an appeal by vinmar overseas (singapore) pte ltd (“vinmar”) against the decision of the high court, which affirmed the decision of the assistant registrar (“the ar”) to refuse to grant a stay of proceedings to give effect to an exclusive jurisdiction clause.  
the material facts
2          between december 2013 and october 2014, vinmar entered into four contracts to purchase chemical commodities from ptt international trading pte ltd (“ptt”) and ptt public company limited (“ptt public”), ptt’s parent company. all of the four contracts included an exclusive jurisdiction clause that conferred jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the relevant contract on the high court of england (“the ejc”). 
3          in november 2014, vinmar entered into a contract (“the contract”) to purchase styrene monomer from ptt. vinmar claimed that the ejc was a term of the contract. the ejc was one of the terms in a written agreement sent by ptt to vinmar relating to the contract (“the written terms”). 
4          a dispute arose between vinmar and ptt. vinmar terminated the contract. ptt then began proceedings in singapore (“suit 99”) against vinmar. vinmar applied for a stay of suit 99 on the basis that the parties had agreed to refer the dispute to the english high court.  
5          the ar and the high court found that the ejc was a term of the contract. however, they refused to grant a stay of suit 99 on the basis that vinmar did not have a genuine defence to ptt’s claim, relying on a long line of court of appeal authorities for the proposition that the lack of a genuine defence would amount to strong cause to refuse a stay. 
the decision on appeal
6          the court of appeal allowed vinmar’s appeal.
7          the court of appeal first held that vinmar had made out a good arguable case that the ejc was a term of the contract. the court began its analysis by addressing the preliminary issue of what the test of a “good arguable case” entails (at [41]–[46]). having set out the law, the court rejected vinmar’s argument that the parties had agreed to the written terms (at [50]–[51]). however, the court accepted that there was a good arguable case that the ejc was incorporated by the parties’ course of dealings into the contract. in this regard, the court expounded on the law on incorporation by a course of dealings (at [53]–[58]), before finding that vinmar had established a good arguable case that the ejc was incorporated into the contract (at [59]–[68]). 
8          the court of appeal then turned to consider the relevance of the merits of the defence that an applicant in an ejc application would raise. after tracing the development of the law, the court held that the time had come to depart from the rule in the jian he [1999] 3 slr(r) 432 (“the jian he”) that the absence of a meritorious defence would suffice to establish strong cause to refuse a stay, for two principal reasons (at [113]). first, for reasons of principle, policy and coherence in the law, the merits of the defence should be irrelevant in an ejc application (at [114]–[119]). second, the doctrinal basis on which the merits of the defence were incorporated as a relevant factor into the general test in an ejc application was flawed (at [120]–[125]). the court then recognised two general grounds upon which a stay might be refused in an ejc application where the only parties involved in the dispute were the parties to the jurisdiction agreement: namely, abuse of process and denial of justice (at [129]–[134]). 
9          the court of appeal left open the issue of whether the principles it had set out applied equally to jurisdiction clauses in bills of lading and standard form contracts that the plaintiff was not in a position to negotiate (at [138]). the court also briefly addressed peripheral issues pertaining to parallel proceedings and time-bars (at [139]–[141]).
10        having decided that it should depart from the rule in the jian he, the court of appeal held that the rule should not be overruled with only prospective effect.  there was no serious and demonstrable injustice that justified an application of the doctrine of prospective overruling (at [144]). ptt would suffer some prejudice from the court’s departure from the rule in the jian he. however, this could be addressed through orders on costs (at [145]).
11        applying the law to the facts, the court of appeal rejected ptt’s submission that the abuse of process ground for refusing a stay was made out (at [147]). the court then found that there was no strong cause to refuse a stay (at [148(b)]).
12        the court of appeal therefore allowed the appeal and ordered a stay of suit 99. the court also ordered that there would be no order as to costs for the appeal and the costs orders below would remain (at [149]).
