magistrate’s appeal no 9352 of 2017 and criminal motion no 12 of 2018
____________________________________________________________________
decision of the high court (delivered by sundaresh menon cj)
outcome: hc dismissed accused’s application to retract guilty plea as sentencing judge did not make any promise that he would receive only the minimum sentence if he pleaded guilty. 
the material facts
1          the accused was convicted of two charges by the district judge (“the dj”). the first was for theft in dwelling under s 380 of the penal code of a presentation remote valued at $169 from a popular bookstore. the second was for theft in dwelling of a handheld camera valued at $348 from a samsung experience store. the two incidents took place on different occasions and at different shopping malls. a third charge for theft in dwelling of a hue tap switch valued at $89 from harvey norman was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. the accused pleaded guilty and the dj sentenced him to 2 and 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the first and second charge respectively, with the individual sentences ordered to run concurrently to derive an aggregate 3 weeks’ imprisonment term. 
2          the accused appealed against the sentence imposed. during the course of the appeal, the accused also sought to retract his guilty plea on the primary basis that he had pleaded guilty only because the dj promised or represented to him at a pre-trial conference held on 30 october 2017 (“the 30 october ptc”) that he would receive only a one-day imprisonment term if he pleaded guilty. according to the statute, imprisonment is mandatory for the offence of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the penal code and therefore a day’s imprisonment is the minimum statutory sentence. 
3          the prosecution opposed the accused’s retraction application. it sought to adduce an affidavit deposed to by the deputy public prosecutor (“dpp”) who attended the 30 october ptc (“the affidavit”). relying on the affidavit and the transcripts of subsequent open court hearings before the dj on 8 november 2017 (“the 8 november pg hearing”) and 22 november 2017, the prosecution submitted that the accused’s allegations were untruthful and that he had in fact voluntarily decided to plead guilty.


the court’s decision
4          the high court dismissed the accused’s application to retract his plea of guilt, and also his appeal against the sentence imposed. 
5          generally, where an accused person applies to retract his plea of guilt and makes certain allegations to ground the application, courts will require the adduction of sworn or affirmed evidence by the relevant persons or authorities concerned, in order to assist the inquiry into the veracity of the allegations and also to allow the party against whom allegations were made an opportunity to respond (at [20]). in the present case, the accused’s allegations centered around what the dj had alleged said or done at the 30 october ptc, which was conducted in the privacy of the dj’s chambers (which is the proper and usual practice for pre trial conferences). in that context, the affidavit of the dpp who attended the conference was highly probative, particularly since it was not for the dj as a judicial officer to provide evidence himself as to what transpired at that conference (at [24]). thus, the admission of the affidavit was proper and necessary (at [27]). 
6          as a matter of principle, if a judge or judicial officer made a promise or unequivocal representation to the accused that he would receive a particular sentence on condition that he pleads guilty, and that promise or representation in fact induced the accused to plead guilty when he would not otherwise have done so, that would almost always constitute good grounds for the conviction premised on that plea to be set aside (at [37]). this does not apply, however, to some limited situations such as if the judge merely explained the mechanics of the sentencing process, or conveyed the statutorily-prescribed sentencing range, to the accused. it also does not apply to formalised processes under which judges provide accused persons with sentencing indications, such as the criminal case resolution regime which is subject to various safeguards (at [38]). 
7          as a matter of evidence, taking into account the ease with which it may be alleged that a judge had made certain promises or representations to an accused person in chambers, and the fact that it runs wholly counter to the basic judicial duty of a judge to make such a promise or representation, cogent evidence would generally be required before a court will conclude that such an improper promise or representation had in fact been made (at [39]).
8          in the present case, not only was there an absence of any such corroborating evidence, the surrounding evidence in fact pointed against the truth of the accused’s allegations against the dj (at [40]). first, the accused’s account was internally inconsistent (at [41]). second, it was unequivocally contradicted by the affidavit (at [42]). third, if his contention were true, it would require the court to find that two public officers had conspired in a gross miscarriage of justice. such a serious allegation would have to be supported by strong corroborating evidence, which was notably absent (at [43]). fourth, it was inherently inconceivable that the dj would have made such a representation when this would clearly have been improper judicial conduct and when the sentence allegedly promised would almost certainly have run contrary to the position that the prosecution would wish to take (at [44]). fifthly, the allegation ran counter to what occurred subsequently at the 8 november pg hearing, where amongst other things the dj repeatedly and unequivocally told the accused that he could not come to any conclusion as to the sentence that would in fact be imposed, until after the plea had been taken and after he had heard the parties’ sentencing submissions (at [45]). 
9          accordingly, the court disbelieved the accused’s allegation that the dj had promised or represented to him that he would receive only one­ day’s imprisonment and a fine if he pleaded guilty (at [46]). instead, the irresistible inference was that the accused’s attempt to retract his earlier plea of guilt was motivated by the fact that he received a sentence that was more onerous than what he had hoped for (at [47]). 
10        as for the appeal against the sentence imposed, it was clear that the sentences were not manifestly excessive. a deterrent sentence was called for, with appropriate emphasis in this case on the interest of specific deterrence, given the accused’s recent set of property-related antecedents in november 2016. further, the sentences imposed were in line with precedent (at [57]). indeed, the aggregate sentence imposed was on the low side, since the accused was effectively not being punished at all for the second charge by virtue of the dj’s decision to run the individual sentences concurrently. however, since the prosecution had not appealed for a higher sentence, the court did not interfere with the sentences that were imposed in this case (at [59]).
