decision of anselmo reyes ij 
outcome: sicc orders plaintiff to pay

defendant’s costs of s$40,000 applying appendix g to the supreme court

practice directions. 
background


1             

this

judgment dealt with the costs of the proceedings in os 1 of 2019 (“os 1”),

sum 1035/2019 (“sum 1035”) and sum 5770/2018 (“sum 5770”). these proceedings arose

out of an award issued in a singapore-seated arbitration (“the award”). os 1

was the plaintiff’s application to set aside the award, sum 1035 was the

defendant’s application to strike out os 1, and sum 5770 was the defendant’s

application, pending the provision by the plaintiff of security for costs

ordered by the singapore court and pending the hearing of sum 1035, for an

extension of time to file an affidavit in response in os 1. sum 5770 was heard before

an assistant registrar on 30 january 2019 and the time extension was granted. os

1 and sum 1035 were heard together on 30 may 2019 before the court, which decided

in favour of the defendant in bxs v bxt [2019]

sghc(i) 10.
the court's decision
2             

the

court dealt with three issues: (a) who should bear the costs of os 1, sum 1035,

and sum 5770? (b) what should the amount of those costs be? (c) what interest

should run on such costs? 
3             

on

the first issue, the court held that the plaintiff should bear the costs of all

three applications. the defendant having prevailed in os 1 and sum 1035, the

plaintiff should bear the defendant’s costs of those two applications. further,

given the assistant registrar’s directions on 30 january 2019 that the costs of

sum 5770 be in the cause, the plaintiff should also bear the defendant’s costs

of that application (at [3]–[4]). 
4             

on

the second issue, the court held that the defendant’s reasonable costs amounted

to s$40,000 all-in. the plaintiff had sought s$15,800 relying on the lower end

of the scale in appendix g to the supreme court practice direction (“appendix

g”). the defendant had sought s$70,000 in costs, arguing that even though the

amount of costs would be lower if appendix g applied, appendix g should be

departed from in this case. the court held that appendix g applied

notwithstanding that os 1 had been transferred to the court on 8 march 2019.

this was so in light of the parties’ understanding at the time when the case

was transferred to the court that there should be no difference in the way that

costs are taxed as a result of the transfer. next, the court assessed the costs

of os 1, sum 1035 and sum 5770 on the higher end of the ranges identified in

appendix g. the plaintiff’s belated narrowing down of arguments in os 1 and sum

1035 meant that the defendant had to incur costs in preparing to meet all the

arguments that the plaintiff seemed minded to deploy almost to the end.

regarding sum 5770, even though the application was unopposed, the plaintiff

did not make this known to the defendant until just before the parties’

attendance before the assistant registrar on 30 january 2019. by then, the

defendant would have incurred costs in preparing for sum 5770. the court did

not accept that appendix g should be departed from simply because the plaintiff

and not only the defendant had made use of three solicitors, or because the

defendant had chosen to employ two firms of solicitors in two different

jurisdictions rather than a single firm in the seat of arbitration. the court

also did not find that the plaintiff’s alleged culpable conduct was relevant to

the assessment of costs in these applications, because such conduct had arisen

in connection with other separate applications and would have been considered

by the courts undertaking the taxation of those applications (at [14]–[21]).

on

the third issue, the court held that simple interest of 5.33% per annum should

run on the costs determined, this being the default rate applicable to costs in

ordinary singapore court proceedings under paragraph 77(7) of the supreme court

practice directions (at [22]).
