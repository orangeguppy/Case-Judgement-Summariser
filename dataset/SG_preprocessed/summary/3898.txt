singapore international commercial court suit no 4 of 2017



kiri industries ltd v senda international capital ltd and another 

[2019] sghc(i) 02
____________________________________________________________________

background




1 this case arose out of directions issued by the court at a case

management conference held on 23 november 2018 ("the cmc"). the cmc was

held pursuant to the court’s decision in an earlier judgment,



dystar global holdings (singapore) pte ltd v kiri industries ltd and

others and another suit



[2018] 5 slr 1 ("the main judgment"), in respect of suit no 3 of 2017

("suit 3") and suit no 4 of 2017 ("suit 4") (at [1]).




2 in the main judgment, the court held that kiri industries limited

("kiri") succeeded in its claim for minority oppression, and that senda

international capital limited ("senda") purchase kiri’s 37.57% shareholding

("kiri’s shareholding") in dystar global holdings (singapore) pte ltd

("dystar"). the purchase was to be based on a valuation to be assessed as

of the date of the main judgment, and it was stipulated that the valuation

of kiri’s shareholding should take into account losses arising from various

oppressive acts by senda. the court also allowed in part dystar’s claims in

suit 3 and senda’s counterclaims in suit 4. in particular, the court

entered interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed for dystar and

senda against kiri for breaches of the share subscription and shareholders

agreement ("the sssa") (at [2]).




3 at the cmc, several issues were addressed, and the court gave directions

dealing with those issues. in relation to how the valuation of kiri’s

shareholding would be conducted, it was common ground between the parties

that the court should undertake the valuation, with each party appointing

its own independent expert(s) to assess the value of kiri’s shareholding,

and the court then making the final determination. in relation to whether

kiri was entitled to interest on the amount payable to it by kiri pursuant

to the buy-out order, the court reserved its ruling until after its

decision on the valuation of kiri’s shareholding (at [3]–    [4]).




4 the court decided that a minority discount for lack of control should not

be factored in the valuation of kiri’s shareholding. the court also

rejected senda’s submission that it was necessary for further evidence to

be adduced before the court could determine the issue of whether a minority

discount ought to be factored in the valuation of kiri’s shareholding. the

findings necessary to arrive at a determination on whether a minority

discount ought to be given had already been made in the main judgment. on

the basis of those findings, senda’s conduct fell within the situations in

which the court would not usually order a minority discount. in particular,

it was clear that the common thread underpinning the findings of

commercially unfair conduct was that they were designed to extract benefits

or value out of dystar. it was conduct that was directed at worsening the

position of the minority as shareholders, and which compelled the minority

shareholder to seek a buy-out. it was also clear that senda’s oppressive

conduct was entirely responsible for the breakdown in the parties’

relationship. it was not appropriate or necessary for senda to adduce

further evidence as the matters it sought to adduce evidence on were within

the issues canvassed at trial, and were dealt with in the main judgment (at    [8]–[17]).




5 the court rejected senda’s submission that a 20% discount ought to be

applied to the assessed fair value of kiri’s shareholding, pursuant to the

termination provisions in the sssa. in particular, senda relied on cl 16 of

the sssa, contending that kiri’s breaches of the sssa constituted "material

breach[es]" of the sssa, which gave senda the right to buy-out kiri’s

shares at a 20% discount. the court rejected this submission as senda had

never sought to exercise the contractual right under cl 16 the sssa to

purchase kiri’s

shareholding at a 20% discount. the court emphasised that the buy-out order

was made as a result of the acts of oppression that had been found, and it

was contrived to say that the valuation should also take on board a

discount which had no connection to kiri’s cause of action for minority

oppression and the relief that was ordered (at [18]–    [24]).




6 the court also set timelines for the parties to file and exchange the

affidavit evidence of their expert witnesses and witnesses of fact,

including any responsive affidavit evidence. the court clarified that the

evidence of the witnesses should relate to both the valuation of kiri’s

shareholding and the assessment of the loss caused by the various acts of

oppression by senda that had been found in the main judgment. the court did

not accept senda’s submission that determination of the price at which

senda was to buy-out kiri’s shareholding ought to be in two stages namely,

an assessment of the loss caused by senda’s acts of oppression as found by

the court, and the valuation of kiri’s shareholding. it held that the

assessment of the loss caused by senda’s acts of oppression was very much

intertwined with the valuation of kiri’s shareholding, and there was no

useful purpose served in splitting the valuation exercise into two stages

as senda had suggested (at [25]–[28]).




7 on the matter of costs, the court directed that (at [29]

–[33]):




(a) kiri was entitled to full costs on its claim in suit 4. although kiri

had abandoned or failed on various allegations of oppression, it had

succeeded on the fundamental issue in the suit – ie, that it was

being oppressed by senda. further, whether kiri’s claims were analysed in

respect of the various categories of oppressive conduct alleged, or in

respect of the individual allegations within those categories, kiri had

more than substantially succeeded in establishing the allegations of

oppression.




(b) no order as to the costs of the counterclaim in suit 4.




(c) in respect of suit 3, while dystar had succeeded in some respects in

its claims against kiri, it failed in establishing most of its allegations,

in particular, as regards breaches of the non-compete and non-solicitation

clauses in the sssa. as such, the court ordered that dystar was entitled

to, as against kiri, 10% of the costs of its claim. however, as dystar

failed entirely in its claims against the other defendants to suit 3, the

other defendants were entitled to their costs against dystar.




(d) all such costs were to be taxed if not agreed.
