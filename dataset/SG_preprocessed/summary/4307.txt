civil appeal no 92 of 2017
_____________________________________________________________________
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by judge of appeal judith prakash):
1          the main issue in this appeal was whether the family justice courts, when dividing matrimonial assets between divorcing spouses under s 112 of the women’s charter, had the jurisdiction to hear and determine claims by a third party to be the legal or beneficial owner of any alleged matrimonial asset (a “disputed asset”), and to make orders directly affecting the third party’s interest in the disputed asset (such as an order that the asset be sold or transferred).
2          the court of appeal held that the family justice courts did not have the jurisdiction to do so under s 112, and set out guidance as to how such third party claims should be approached.
background to the appeal
3          the husband and wife were in the midst of divorce proceedings. the husband claimed that a house legally owned by the wife’s mother was held on trust for the divorcing spouses, and thus constituted a matrimonial asset which could be divided. the wife’s mother (hereafter “the intervener”) disputed this and obtained leave to intervene in the divorce proceedings.
4          the family court judge granted leave for the husband, wife and intervener to be cross-examined in relation to the dispute over the ownership of the house. the wife and intervener appealed to a judge of the family division of the high court (“the judge”) against the order for cross-examination. on appeal, the judge decided to temporarily halt the hearing of the ancillary matters pending the resolution of the intervener’s claim in a civil court. she took the view that s 112 of the women’s charter did not permit the court to make an order directly affecting the intervener’s property rights. the proper recourse was for the husband to commence separate civil proceedings to determine the property dispute.
5          the intervener wanted her issue to be decided by the court that heard the ancillary matters and therefore appealed to the court of appeal. she argued that the judge had jurisdiction and power to determine the beneficial ownership of the property and make consequential orders directly affecting her rights and interest in the property. the court of appeal dismissed the appeal for the reasons set out below.
the scope of the power under s 112 of the women’s charter
6          the court of appeal held that s 112 of the women’s charter did not give a court the power to hear and determine a third party’s claim to an alleged matrimonial asset or make orders against the third party. this was clear from the wording of s 112:
a          the court only had power to divide matrimonial assets “when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage”. this power arose in the specific context of matrimonial proceedings, which involved the spouses alone and not a third party. ([28])
b          the division of assets could only be ordered “between the parties”, ie, the spouses and not a third party. ([29])
c          the court could only divide a “matrimonial asset”, which was defined in s 112(10) as any asset “acquired” by one or both spouses. the word “acquired” did not mean acquisition of bare legal title, but acquisition of beneficial ownership (with or without legal title). an asset beneficially owned by a third party could not be divided under s 112. ([31])
d          this understanding of s 112 was confirmed by its other sub-sections, for example ss 112(2) and 112(5). ([32]–[33])
7          the intervener also argued that the judge had jurisdiction to decide her claim pursuant to the provisions of the family justice act 2014 (“the fja”) or the supreme court of judicature act (“the scja”). the court of appeal rejected this argument. although s 25 of the fja gave the family division the entire original civil jurisdiction of the high court, this was a gap-filling provision to assist the family division in exercising its primary jurisdiction. the intervener had not invoked the general jurisdiction of the high court; she had merely intervened in the s 112 proceedings under r 353 of the family justice rules, which did not confer substantive jurisdiction. ([44]–[48])
the proper approach to third party claims arising in s 112 proceedings
8          where a third party wished to directly assert his rights to a disputed asset, he should start separate civil proceedings against either or both spouses. he could also apply to intervene in the s 112 proceedings to notify the family court of his alleged interest, in which case the family court should stay (ie, temporarily halt) the s 112 proceedings. ([54]–[55])
9          if the court was notified of the third party’s alleged interest but no separate action had been commenced, then different options might be available depending on the legal ownership of the property concerned.
10        a third party claim could arise in two situations: (a) where the asset was legally owned by a third party, but one or both spouses claimed that it was held on trust for them; and (b) where the asset was held in the name of one of the spouses, who claimed that it was held on trust for a third party and therefore could not be a matrimonial asset. in the former situation, the following options would be available ([56]–[57]):
a          the third party could give legally binding confirmation that he or she held the asset on trust, and undertake to respect and enforce any order that the court might make relating to the beneficial interests in the asset.
b          if the third party did not agree, either spouse would have to start a separate legal action against the third party to have the rights in the asset finally determined. in the meantime, the s 112 proceedings would have to be stayed.
c          alternatively, the spouse could drop his or her claim that the property was a matrimonial asset.
d          a fourth option was for the court to determine on the evidence before it whether the asset was a matrimonial asset, without involving the third party at all. if the court concluded that the disputed asset was beneficially owned by one or both spouses, it could include the asset in the matrimonial pool. instead of making an order directly affecting that asset, the court would adjust the division of other assets to account for its value. this option would not be viable if the disputed asset was the main or only substantial asset available for division. moreover, this option should only be used if both spouses agreed to it. the determination of ownership would not bind the third party, who could challenge it in separate proceedings.
11        in the second situation (ie, where the disputed asset was legally owned by one of the spouses who claimed to hold it on trust for a third party), the court could also use the last option (para 10(d) above) if the parties agreed to it. but if the spouse(s) sought an order binding the third party, a separate set of proceedings would have to be issued. ([58])
12        in this case, the intervener was asserting her rights to the disputed asset directly. the judge therefore had no choice but to stay the proceedings, since she could not determine the intervener’s claim under s 112. it was also correct to stay the proceedings because the disputed asset would be the major matrimonial asset (if indeed it was a matrimonial asset). the appeal was therefore dismissed.
