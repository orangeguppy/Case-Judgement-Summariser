case summary
gopu jaya raman v public

prosecutor [2018] sgca 9
criminal appeal no 40 of 2016
____________________________________________________________________
background
1          this

was an appeal by gopu jaya raman (“the appellant”), who was sentenced to death

in the high court after being convicted of a single charge under s 7 of the

misuse of drugs act (cap 185, 2008 rev ed) (“the mda”) for the unauthorised importation

of diamorphine, against his conviction and sentence. the primary issue in this

appeal was whether the appellant could rebut the presumption of possession

under s 21 of the mda. this presumption arose because the appellant had been

arrested with three bundles containing prohibited drugs found hidden in the

motorcycle that he had borrowed to ride into singapore, and his defence was

that the drugs had been planted in the motorcycle without his knowledge. the

appellant was thus required to show, on the balance of probabilities, that he

did not know that the drugs were hidden in his motorcycle.
2          a

majority of the court of appeal (consisting of chief justice sundaresh menon

and judge of appeal judith prakash, with judge of appeal tay yong kwang

dissenting) acquitted the appellant of the charge, finding that the appellant

has succeeded in rebutting the presumption of possession under s 21 of the mda

on the balance of probabilities.
the

material facts
3          the

appellant had ridden into singapore through the woodlands checkpoint on a

motorcycle on 24 march 2014. immigration and checkpoints authority (“ica”) officers

at the checkpoint discovered three bundles containing prohibited drugs concealed

in a space enclosed by the motorcycle’s fenders. the appellant appeared

confused and lost when confronted with the discovery, and denied ownership of

the bundles. 
4          in

the contemporaneous statement taken by officers from the central narcotics

bureau (“cnb”) shortly after his arrest, the appellant maintained his lack of

knowledge of the bundles, and shared that he had borrowed the motorcycle from

one “ganesh” by collecting it from one “ah boy”, who was an associate of ganesh.

the cnb officers then carried out a follow-up operation aimed at apprehending

potential recipients of the drugs from the appellant. during the operation, the

appellant was instructed to communicate with ganesh, who the appellant believed

had arranged for the drugs to be planted in the motorcycle. the cnb officers

monitored the appellant’s conversations with ganesh, but no audio recordings

were made.
5          in

three subsequent statements taken by the cnb, the appellant acknowledged that

he had carried out drug deliveries on two previous occasions, but consistently denied

any knowledge of the bundles on this occasion. he also explained that he had

come to singapore to visit his girlfriend and another friend in order to

celebrate his birthday. next, he claimed that when he stopped to refuel the

motorcycle before reaching the causeway, he had checked the seat compartment

portion of the motorcycle which was located just above the space enclosed by

the fenders (and which was where the drugs had been kept during the two

previous deliveries), but found nothing there. further, he mentioned that while

he was riding on the causeway towards singapore, he received a call from ganesh

who asked him to call him when he arrived in singapore. when he asked ganesh

why, he was told that the “recipients changed their contact numbers”. finally,

the appellant claimed that during the cnb’s follow-up operation, he had been

directed by the cnb officer monitoring his conversation with ganesh to draft a

text message to ganesh complaining that ganesh had not previously told the

appellant about the drugs; this showed that the officer had also formed the

impression that the appellant did not in fact have knowledge of the drugs.
6          the

appellant’s defence was that he did not know that drugs had been hidden in the motorcycle

because they had been planted there without his knowledge. in support of this,

the appellant argued that: (a) he had been candid and consistent throughout the

investigation proceedings, and even voluntarily revealed that he had made two

previous drug deliveries; (b) his conduct upon arrest and during the follow-up

operation was consistent with that of a person who was unaware of the drugs;

and (c) the cnb officers had heard his conversations with ganesh during cnb’s

follow-up operations, which strongly corroborated the appellant’s lack of

knowledge of the drugs.
7          the

high court judge (“the judge”) rejected his defence and found him guilty of the

charge. as the appellant did not receive a certificate of substantive

assistance, the judge sentenced him to death. the appellant appealed against

both his conviction and sentence.
decision

of the majority (delivered by menon cj on behalf of prakash ja and himself)
8          the

majority disagreed with the judge below, and held that the appellant should be

acquitted of the charge. they were satisfied that the appellant has succeeded

in rebutting the presumption of possession under s 21 of the mda by proving, on

the balance of probabilities, that the drugs in the three bundles were not in

his possession because they had been planted in his motorcycle without his

knowledge. ([23], [91], [94])
reasons

for the majority’s decision
9          the

majority prefaced its judgment by emphasising that the court should bear in

mind the inherent difficulties of proving a negative when evaluating the

evidence to determine whether an offender has been able to rebut the relevant

presumptions in the mda raised against him or her, and that the burden placed

on the offender should not be so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible

to discharge. in this regard, the majority also cautioned that the court should

be mindful of the importance of not approaching its assessment of the evidence

having, consciously or otherwise, already adopted a certain starting premise in

its analysis. a fact that is consistent with two contrasting possibilities

should be regarded as probatively neutral, with no predilection for either

conclusion, even if a statutory presumption is in operation. ([2], [24]–[25])
10        the

majority arrived at its conclusion to acquit the appellant on the basis of: (a)

the totality of the evidence including, in particular, the evidence of the

appellant’s conversations with ganesh during the follow-up operation; and (b) the

absence of any objective evidence linking the appellant to the drugs. while it

was clear that ganesh and ah boy wanted to transport the drugs into singapore,

the evidence showed that the appellant was not part of this plan. ([23], [92]–[93]) 
11        in

particular, the majority made the following findings:
a          it was not implausible for ganesh to

lend the appellant rm150 and the motorcycle and for ah boy to lend the

appellant the sim card, even though the appellant had refused to continue

delivering drugs for ganesh to pay off the loan that the appellant had previously

obtained from ganesh. ganesh and ah boy could have been taking advantage of the

appellant’s simple-mindedness to facilitate a drug delivery in singapore. ([48]–[51])
            b          while the appellant was suspicious

after ganesh’s phone call to him while he was on the causeway, it would not be

proper or fair to suggest that the appellant knew that there were drugs hidden in the motorcycle on the basis of

that phone call. ([52]–[55])
            c          during the cnb’s follow-up operation,

the cnb officers did observe that the appellant had asked ganesh why he had put

the drugs in the motorcycle without informing him, which ganesh did not refute.

the appellant’s account was corroborated by the cnb officer’s contemporaneous

investigation diary, the appellant’s cautioned statement, and the contents of

the text message that the appellant was instructed to send to ganesh. ([56]–[72])
            d         there was no basis for the judge to

conclude that there was a prior arrangement among ganesh, ah boy and the appellant to deliver the drugs

on the present occasion. ([73]–[81])
            e          the appellant’s account was corroborated

by the objective evidence. the absence of any trace of the appellant’s dna on

the bundles or any of the relevant parts of the motorcycle showed that there

was no objective evidence establishing that the appellant had hidden the drugs

in the motorcycle. ([82]–[86])
            f           it was not implausible that the

appellant had come to singapore on an impromptu basis hoping to meet his friend

or his girlfriend. ([87]–[90])
decision

of the minority (delivered by tay ja)
12        tay ja agreed with the judge below that

the appellant is guilty as charged, and would dismiss the appeal against the

conviction. as the death penalty was also mandatory on the facts, tay ja would

also dismiss the appeal against sentence. ([99],

[139])
reasons for the minority’s decision
13        the appellant’s evidence, taken as a

whole, showed that the appellant knew that the bundles of drugs had been hidden

in the motorcycle, and therefore could not rebut the statutory presumption

against him under s 21 of the mda on a balance of probabilities. the evidence

pointed clearly to the conclusion that this was the appellant’s third drug

delivery or import into singapore to repay the loan that he had taken from

ganesh. ([120], [137])
14        in reaching this conclusion, tay ja made

the following findings:
            a          the

appellant’s explanations for wanting to come to singapore in the evening of 24

march 2014 and for how he had managed to borrow the motorcycle and rm150 from

ganesh and ah boy were not believable, undermined the appellant’s credibility,

and cast serious doubts on his claims that he did not know that the drugs were

hidden in the motorcycle. ([121]–[128])
            b          the

appellant’s self-inculpatory statements that he had imported drugs into

singapore on two earlier occasions did not necessarily bolster his credibility,

since nothing had been said about the nature or quantity of the drugs on those

occasions. ([129])
            c          the

telephone calls made and messages sent between the appellant and ganesh during

the cnb’s follow-up operations did not corroborate the appellant’s story that

he did not know that there were drugs hidden in the motorcycle. ([130]–[132])
            d          the

fact that the appellant failed to inform the ica officers of his suspicions

that there might be drugs hidden in the motorcycle before they conducted their

search of the motorcycle undermined the credibility of the appellant, because

that would have been the obvious course of action taken by an innocent man. ([135])
            e          although

the dna evidence was inconclusive on whether the appellant was the person who

had concealed the drugs in the motorcycle, that alone did not mean that he did

not know that there were drugs in the motorcycle when he took possession of it

from ah boy. ([136])
