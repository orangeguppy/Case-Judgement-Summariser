and second, he had no realistic moment of rationality and self-control that would have enabled him to resile from that intention or plan (at [51]–[52]).11 on the facts, the court rejected that the appellant’s adjustment disorder had substantially impaired his mental responsibility. he was rational, had self-control, and was fully able to comprehend events at the critical moment when he decided to kill yati. his statements to the police and to dr cheok showed that the acts of killing were motivated by the appellant’s logical fear that yati would report him to the police for assaulting her (at [58]–[59]). dr cheok corroborated that the appellant did not lose self-control, nor his judgment of what was right or wrong. dr cheok based his view on the facts that the plan to kill was pre-meditated, the appellant came up with a decision tree to kill, and exhibited self-control on the day of the killing (at [60]).12 the court also rejected the defence’s submissions that yati telling the appellant that 30 december was the last time they met led to a sudden surge of negative emotions, culminating in the killing. at the beginning of their meeting, yati had told the appellant that that would be the last time they met. before they met, yati had told the appellant the same. hence, there was no sudden or shocking stressor that would have triggered the appellant (at [65], [68]). 13 for the reasons above, the court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence of mandatory death penalty (at [71]).this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
