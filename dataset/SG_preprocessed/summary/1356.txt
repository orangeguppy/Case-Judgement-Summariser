rather, their case was that damages were to be quantified based on the ebitda for fy 2021 as projected in business plan 2015 (“bp 2015”), a plan which contained the parties’ reasonable and agreed expectations of the company’s potential future earnings. as for the exhibits, they were tendered not for the purpose of establishing actual loss, but for the limited purpose of rebutting fresh materials in the defendant’s expert evidence, which suggested that the company’s business had no market or growth potential generally.8 hence, the plaintiffs complained that the findings of the damages majority were made in excess of the parties’ submission to arbitration, in breach of the rules of natural justice and contrary to the public policy of singapore.9 after the three-month time limit for applying to set aside the award, the plaintiffs sought to amend its os to challenge two additional paragraphs of the award. the plaintiffs claimed that these two extra paragraphs would also fall, if they were right in their substantive critique of the original two paragraphs challenged in its os.the court’s grounds of decision10 whether the plaintiffs’ amendment application ought to be allowed was a moot point, as the court found no basis to set aside any of the impugned paragraphs (at [31]). the issue of causation and quantification of actual loss was squarely before the tribunal (at [14]).11 from the plaintiffs’ pleading, it was apparent that the plaintiffs recognised that they needed to show causation (at [16]). moreover, by virtue of the defendant’s defence on the lack of causation, the tribunal was entitled to determine the issue of whether causation in respect of the alleged loss of earn-out payment had been made out (at [29]).12 it was also plain to the tribunal, based on the parties’ issues list and the plaintiffs’ closing submissions, that the plaintiffs were not only advancing a case on loss based on bp 2015, but also a case seeking an assessment of damages on some alternative basis (at [18], [20], [22]). in this regard, the plaintiffs should have appreciated that the exhibits were bound to be considered in connection with the issue of causation and quantification of actual loss (at [23]). during the evidentiary hearing, the tribunal had invited the plaintiffs to make good the deficiencies in their factual evidence on actual loss of the earn-out payment (at [24]–[25]). having realised their predicament, the plaintiffs deployed the exhibits in support of a case of actual loss in their closing submissions (at [26] and [30]).13 in these circumstances, the court found that the damages majority did not exceed the tribunal’s jurisdiction and was instead tackling an issue on which the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to respond. consequently, there was nothing contrary to singapore public policy in how the tribunal had conducted the arbitration (at [30]). the plaintiffs’ application to set aside two paragraphs in the award was thus dismissed, along with their application to amend its os to set aside two further paragraphs (at [32]).this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
