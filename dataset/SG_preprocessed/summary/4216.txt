coa dismisses appeal against hc decision to set aside adjudication determination for breach of natural justice due to adjudicator’s failure to consider essential arguments raised before him; orders counsel for both parties to bear personal liability for part of the costs due to their failure to conduct the proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition.
 
background
2          this was an appeal brought by bintai kindenko private limited (“bintai”) against the decision of the high court judge (“the judge’) to grant an application by samsung c&t corporation (“samsung”) to set aside an adjudication determination (“the adjudication determination”) made by the adjudicator (“the adjudicator”) appointed in adjudication proceedings commenced pursuant to the building and construction industry security of payment act (cap 30b, 2006 rev ed) (“the act”). the judge had found that the adjudicator had failed to consider two essential issues raised in the adjudication response filed by samsung (“the adjudication response”), which constituted a failure of natural justice. 
the material facts
3          bintai was engaged by samsung as a subcontractor in a construction project for which samsung was the main contractor. a dispute between the parties arose out of payment claim no 59 (“pc 59”), in which bintai claimed the sum of $13,479,366.43, and payment response no 59 (“pr 59”), in which samsung stated a response amount of “($2,190,963.62)”. bintai commenced adjudication proceedings against samsung, seeking payment of the sum of $2,146,250.00 (which is for the release of the first half of the retention monies held by samsung), and disputing the payment response amount of “($2,190,963.62)” (“the adjudication application”). in bintai’s submissions, it stated that there were three issues in dispute: (a) the retention monies; (b) the backcharges for scaffolding carried out during the project; and (c) the variation works that had been certified and paid in earlier payment responses but had been recomputed in pr 59. in the adjudication response filed by samsung, samsung addressed the same three issues, as well as an additional preliminary objection to the validity of the adjudication application.
4          the adjudicator found in favour of bintai, ordering samsung to pay bintai the sum claimed by bintai in the adjudication application. however, the adjudication determination addressed only the preliminary issue raised by samsung as well as the issue regarding the release of the first half of the retention monies. it did not go on to consider or address either of the remaining two issues regarding the backcharges and the variation works.
5          samsung commenced proceedings in the high court to set aside the adjudication determination on the sole ground that the adjudicator had failed to consider the two issues regarding backcharges and variation works in the adjudication determination and that this amounted to a breach of natural justice (“the setting aside application”). the judge allowed the setting aside application. bintai appealed the judge’s decision.
the court’s decision
6          the court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the adjudication determination should be set aside because the adjudicator had acted in breach of natural justice in failing to consider the issues regarding the backcharges and variation works that had been raised by samsung in the adjudication response when arriving at his determination, and this breach was sufficiently material as to cause prejudice to samsung. the court fixed the party-and-party costs in favour of samsung in the sum of $20,000 (including disbursements), but also ordered, pursuant to o 59 r 8(1)(a) of the rules of court (cap 322, r 5, 2014 rev ed) (“the roc”), that 90% of the photocopying charges and the stamp fees for the agreed bundle of documents (“the abd”) was not to be charged by bintai’s counsel to bintai, and that samsung’s counsel was to contribute to 20% of the photocopying charges and stamp fees that bintai’s counsel was to bear: at [5], [32], [75].
7          an adjudicator will be found to have acted in breach of natural justice for having failed to consider an issue in the dispute before him only if: (a) the issue was essential to the resolution of the dispute; and (b) a clear and virtually inescapable inference may be drawn that the adjudicator did not apply his mind at all to the said issue. on the facts, the adjudicator had acted in breach of natural justice by failing to consider the two issues regarding the backcharges and variation works because those issues were clearly essential to the resolution of the adjudication application, and it was evident from the adjudication determination as a clear and virtually inescapable inference that the adjudicator did not apply his mind at all to the issues of the backcharges and variation works: at [46], [48]–[50].
8          an adjudication determination may only be set aside on the basis of a breach of natural justice that is sufficiently material as to cause prejudice to the aggrieved party in the adjudication. in order for a breach of natural justice to be considered to be sufficiently material, the issue is whether by reason of that breach, the adjudicator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that could reasonably have made a difference to the outcome in the case. on the facts, the adjudicator’s failure to consider the issues regarding the backcharges and variation works was sufficiently material as to prejudice samsung because had the adjudicator properly considered those two issues in coming to his decision, he could reasonably have found that samsung’s response was valid, such that even if bintai’s claim for the release of the first half of the retention monies were valid, samsung would still not be liable to pay bintai any sum of money: at [60]–[62].
9          there are at least two different types of situations where a solicitor may be regarded as having acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently, such that personal costs orders pursuant to o 59 r 8(1) of the roc may be made against the solicitors in question. first, where a solicitor advances a wholly disingenuous case or files utterly ill-conceived applications even though the solicitor ought to have known better and advised his client against such a course of action, the court may order, pursuant to o 59 r 8(1)(b), the solicitor to bear a portion of the party-and-party costs that have been ordered against his client. second, where the solicitor engages in the thoughtless and undiscerning preparation of documents in respect of court proceedings, the court may, pursuant to o 59 r 8(1)(a), disallow the costs as between the solicitor and his client: at [67]–[69].
10          this was an appropriate case to order counsel for both parties to bear personal liability for the majority of the photocopying charges and the stamp fees incurred in respect of the abd. in preparing for the appeal, the parties were directed by the registry to file the “affidavits relevant to the issue(s) in the appeal (with exhibits edited for relevance)”. however, counsel for bintai filed and served the abd, which comprised 13 volumes of documents amounting to almost 4,000 pages. counsel for both parties had acted unreasonably and improperly in failing to conduct proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition by preparing the relevant documents for the appeal in an indiscriminate, undiscerning and thoughtless manner. the inclusion of copious amounts of unnecessary material in the abd caused the parties to incur unnecessary costs and also inconvenienced the court: at [71]–[74].
