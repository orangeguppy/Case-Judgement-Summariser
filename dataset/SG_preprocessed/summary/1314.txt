supreme court of singapore5 july 2021case summarypublic prosecutor v oskar song hauming and another appeal [2021] sghc 169 magistrate’s appeal no 9689 of 2020/01 and magistrate’s appeal no 9689 of 2020/02--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the general division of the high court (delivered by justice vincent hoong):outcome: the high court allows the prosecution’s appeal against the accused’s community sentence. in place, it imposes eight months’ imprisonment in respect of an amalgamated charge involving 103 incidents of cheating using a dishonestly misappropriated credit card. pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  an offence amalgamated under s 124(4) of the criminal procedure code (cap 68, 2012 rev ed) (“the cpc”) is a single offence (at [46]–[52]).•  on a purposive reading of ss 337(1)(i) of the cpc, where an accused person is convicted of a charge amalgamated under s 124(4), the word “offence” refers to the amalgamated offence, rather than the offences being amalgamated (“the base offence”). therefore, if the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc exceeds three years’ imprisonment, the court is statutorily precluded by s 337(1)(i) from imposing community sentences under part xvii of the cpc even if each base offence of the amalgamated charge is punishable with an imprisonment term of three years or less (at [97]). •  the word “offence” in s 337(2)(c) cpc must be interpreted in the same manner as s 337(1)(i) cpc. under s 337(2)(c), where an offence is punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, the offence must be identified in the criminal procedure code (prescribed offences for mandatory treatment orders) regulations 2018 (s 747/2018) (“prescribed offences regulations”) in order for a mandatory treatment order (“mto”) to be available. since an amalgamated offence is distinct in law from its base offences, and the prescribed offences regulations does not include offences amalgamated under s 124(4) of the cpc, amalgamated offences with a maximum imprisonment term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, under s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc, are necessarily precluded from mtos (at [98]).•  the prosecution must take extreme care when exercising their prosecutorial discretion to frame amalgamated charges so as not to inadvertently preclude a deserving offender from receiving a community sentence (at [76]).facts1 at the material time, the accused was a digital marketing manager at aam advisory (“the company”). the complainant was the chief executive officer of the company. the complainant is the rightful holder of the diners club credit card (“the diners card”) involved in the offences committed by the accused.2 sometime in may 2019, the accused chanced upon the diners card on the floor of a meeting room in the company’s office. he dishonestly misappropriated the diners card despite knowing that it belonged to the complainant. this forms the basis of the s 403 penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed) offence in the first proceeded charge (“the dishonest misappropriation charge”). 3 subsequently, from 4 may 2019 to 27 june 2019, the accused used the diners card to make purchases for himself, his wife and his family members. he presented the diners club to employees working at various sales outlets on 103 occasions (“the employees”) to pay for a range of items including shoes, apparel, sunglasses and wellness packages (“the items”). by doing so, the accused deceived the employees into believing that he was the rightful holder of the diners card and induced the employees to accept the diners card as payment for the items. the prosecution framed an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the cpc (“the amalgamated cheating charge”). the items have a total value of $20,642.48.4 dr lionel lim chee chong (“dr lim”) and dr jerome goh hern yee (“dr goh”) diagnosed the accused with obsessive compulsive personality disorder (“ocpd”) at the time of the offences. dr goh further diagnosed the accused as having suffered from a major depressive episode around the time of the offences. dr lim’s first report, and both of dr goh’s reports concluded that the accused’s mental disorder(s) contributed to the conduct of the offences.5 in the court below, the accused pleaded guilty to the dishonest misappropriation charge and amalgamated cheating charge. two additional charges, an amalgamated cheating charge and an amalgamated attempted cheating charge, were taken-into-consideration for the purposes of sentencing. the district judge (“dj”) sentenced the accused to a community sentence comprising a short detention order (“sdo”) of ten days and an mto for 24 months.6 the prosecution filed an appeal on the grounds that the dj erred in law by ruling that s 337(1)(i) of the cpc did not preclude the imposition of community orders in respect of the amalgamated cheating charge given that the offence therein is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years by virtue of s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the cpc. further, given that community orders were unavailable as a sentencing option, the dj erred in law and in fact in concluding that a custodial sentence of imprisonment was not warranted. 7 the accused subsequently filed a cross-appeal against the sdo on the grounds that its imposition was wrong in law and manifestly excessive. he took the view that the global sentence should only comprise the mto. the court’s decision on appeal8 the high court allowed the prosecution’s appeal against sentence. it imposed eight months’ imprisonment for the amalgamated cheating charge, two months’ imprisonment for the dishonest misappropriation charge and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. accordingly, the accused’s cross-appeal was dismissed.community sentences were not available in light of the amalgamated cheating charge9 under the first step of purposive statutory interpretation, the plain meaning of “offence” in s 337(1)(i) cpc was wide enough to encompass an amalgamated offence (at [44]). this was because s 124(4), read with s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc, fulfilled the definition of “offence” in s 2(1) of the cpc (at [45]). it was also clear, from s 124(4)(b) and s 132 cpc, that an offence amalgamated under s 124(4) of the cpc was a single offence (at [47], [48]).10 other contextual clues indicated that “offence” in s 337(1)(i) cpc should refer to the amalgamated offence under s 124(4) cpc when such an amalgamated charge was framed (at [53]). the references to the sentence of imprisonment in lieu of which a community order is imposed or which is subsequently resurrected for various reasons stipulated in ss 337(5), 337(6), 337(9), 352(5)(b), 354(6)(b) and 354(7)(b) of the cpc, must refer to that imposed in light of s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the cpc (at [58]). bearing this in mind, the court saw no reason for the “term of imprisonment” in s 337(1)(i) to then refer to the court’s sentencing jurisdiction under the base offence, rather than s 124(8)(a)(ii). it followed that “offence” in s 337(1)(i) must refer to the amalgamated offence if the proceeded charge is one amalgamated under s 124(4) cpc (at [58]).11 under the second step of purposive statutory interpretation, the court examined the legislative purposes of part xvii and s 337(1)(i) of the cpc. community sentences in part xvii of the cpc targeted offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum (at [64]). they enabled the courts to deliver the correct mix of deterrence, prevention, retribution and rehabilitation on the specific facts of each case (at [63]). s 337, in turn, was intended to prevent offences or offenders which fell outside of the rehabilitation end of the spectrum from accessing the regime of community orders. s 337(1)(i) cpc filtered out offences punishable with more than three years imprisonment. such offences, in parliament’s view, were not at the rehabilitation end of the spectrum and engaged the other three sentencing considerations of deterrence, prevention and retribution more strongly (at [65]).12 with regards the legislative purpose of the device of amalgamation in s 124(4) of the cpc, the court held that s 124(4) cpc was not merely procedural in nature. instead, amalgamation may be used to signal the higher criminality of the accused and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct (at [69]). this view was supported by the plain wording of s 124(4), as understood in the context of established sentencing principles (at [70]–[75]), and english authorities discussing a similar amalgamation procedure in the uk (at [77]–[82]).13 the prosecution must take extreme care when exercising their prosecutorial discretion to frame amalgamated charges so as not to inadvertently preclude a deserving offender from receiving a community sentence (at [76]). this is because not in all cases will the overall criminality of an accused facing an amalgamated charge comprising x number of incidents be higher than the overall criminality of an accused facing x number of discrete charges for the same base offence. put another way, it was conceptually possible for someone facing an amalgamated offence to still be deserving of a community sentence (at [89]).14 at the third step of purposive statutory interpretation, the court held that parliamentary intention behind ss 124(4), 124(8)(a)(ii) and 337(1)(i) of the cpc was best promoted by interpreting “offence” in s 337(1)(i) cpc as referring to the amalgamated offence, when the accused faced a s 124(4) cpc amalgamated charge (at [85]). therefore, if the court’s enhanced sentencing jurisdiction under s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc exceeded three years’ imprisonment, the court was statutorily precluded by s 337(1)(i) from imposing community sentences under part xvii of the cpc even if each base offence of the amalgamated charge was punishable with an imprisonment term of three years or less (at [97]). 15 the word “offence” in s 337(2)(c) cpc must be interpreted in the same manner as s 337(1)(i) cpc. there was nothing to suggest that the position is otherwise. under s 337(2)(c), where an offence was punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, the offence must be identified in the prescribed offences regulations in order for an mto to be available. since an amalgamated offence was distinct in law from its base offences, and the prescribed offences regulations did not include offences amalgamated under s 124(4) of the cpc, amalgamated offences with a maximum imprisonment term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, under s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc, were necessarily precluded from mtos (at [98]).16 in this case, the maximum imprisonment term under s 124(8)(a)(ii) cpc in respect of the amalgamated cheating charge was six years. this exceeded the three year threshold in s 337(1)(i) cpc, thus precluding the accused from a community sentence. the accused was also ineligible for an mto as offences amalgamated under s 124(4) were not prescribed offences for the purposes of s 337(2)(c) cpc (at [99]).the appropriate sentence in this case17 given the court’s interpretation of s 337(1)(i) of the cpc, the accused’s cross-appeal failed as both an sdo and mto were unavailable (at [100]).18 with regards the sentence for the amalgamated cheating charge, despite the contributory role of the accused’s two mental disorders, general and specific deterrence remained the dominant considerations (at [105]). this was because, inter alia, the offence in the amalgamated cheating charge was premeditated (at [107]), the accused understood the legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions (at [110], [112]) and the accused offended for personal gain (at [113]).19 sundaresh menon cj in idya nurhazlyn bte ahmad khir v public prosecutor and another appeal [2014] 1 slr 756 (“idya nurhazlyn”) at [47] observed that custodial sentences of between four and eight months’ imprisonment were imposed for s 417 penal code offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000. applying the guidance idya nurhazlyn, and having regard to the relevant circumstances in this case (at [122]–[124]), at least 12 months’ imprisonment was justified before the mitigating impact of the accused’s mental disorders was considered (at [121], [125]).20 from the initial position of 12 months’ imprisonment, the court adjusted the custodial sentence for the amalgamated cheating charge downwards by four months to account for the contributory link between the accused’s mental disorders and the commission of the offence (at [126]). finally, the court was not persuaded to reduce the custodial sentence any further in light of the offender-specific mitigating factors raised by the accused (at [127]–[137]).21 with regards the dishonest misappropriation charge, the court imposed two months’ imprisonment and ordered this to run concurrently with the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the amalgamated cheating charge (at [138]–[139]).conclusion22 for the reasons above, a global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was imposed.this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of
