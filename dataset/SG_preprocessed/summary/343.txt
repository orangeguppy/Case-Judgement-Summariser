supreme court of singapore19 may 2023case summarysic/s 1/2022renault sas v liberty engineering group pte ltd [2023] sghc(i) 8--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the singapore international commercial court (delivered by roger giles ij): outcome: the sicc dismissed the plaintiff’s claim of €7m from the defendant under a deed of guarantee.background and facts1 the judgment concerned the construction of a deed of guarantee entered into by the parties on 5 july 2018 (“the guarantee”). the guarantee was given by the defendant pursuant to an agreement to do so under a financial services agreement dated 28 may 2018 (“the fsa”). 2 the fsa was in turn entered into between the plaintiff, the defendant, and liberty house group pte ltd (“lhg”), after the defendant, a singapore incorporated company within lhg, expressed willingness to acquire the operations and assets of one ar industries with the financial support from the plaintiff. this was because ar industries, a french company, which had been a manufacturer of wheels for the automobile industry with the plaintiff as its main client, was placed under redressement judiciaire, a form of receivership or judicial restructuring, by a french court. however, the purchaser of the operations and assets of ar industries was not the defendant, but alvance aluminium wheels (“alvance” or “the purchaser”), an entity controlled by the defendant and not a signatory to the fsa.  3 under article 5 of the fsa, the plaintiff agreed to, inter alia, provide financial support totalling €7m to the purchaser by payments of €1.5m on 1 july and 30 october 2018, €2.5m on 1 july 2019 and €1.5m on 1 july 2020. under article 10, the defendant committed to reimburse the financial support “on first demand, in place of the purchaser” if bankruptcy proceedings were opened towards the purchaser and/or it failed to reimburse the financial support in due time, and to provide a guarantee within 10 days.4 the dispute revolved around the construction of cl 2.1(b) of the guarantee which states, “subject to clause 2.2, the guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally … undertakes that (i) whenever the purchaser does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with the financial support document or (ii) upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy event, the guarantor shall immediately on demand by the financial support provider pay that amount to the financial support provider as if it was the purchaser”.5 on 23 april 2021, the paris court opened redressement judiciaire proceedings for the benefit of alvance. this was a bankruptcy event. on 20 may 2021, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant pay the sum of €7m on the basis that a bankruptcy event had occurred and the full sum was payable to it pursuant to cl 2.1 of the guarantee.6 the defendant rejected the plaintiff’s demand. according to the defendant, nothing was payable by it as guarantor because nothing was then payable by the purchaser, alvance. the bankruptcy event did not accelerate repayment by the purchaser, and as a matter of construction of the guarantee, the defendant was only obliged to pay if the purchaser failed to adhere to the payment terms in article 5 of the fsa.the court’s judgment7 although the guarantee was provided pursuant to the fsa, it was unsafe to construe the guarantee as if it was intended to replicate the commitment in the fsa, and it should be construed on its own terms. the fsa included commitments of the purchaser for breach of which it could incur liability to the plaintiff, and the guarantee contained a very wide definition of obligations owed by the purchaser to the financial support provider (ie, the plaintiff), apt to catch any such breach, the performance of which was also guaranteed; the events constituting a bankruptcy event appeared to be more extensive than those constituting the opening of bankruptcy proceedings in the fsa, and the guarantee imposed additional obligations on the defendant: at [41]–[42].8 the court did not accept that it would be uncommercial or absurd that on a bankruptcy event the reimbursement to the plaintiff was to be according to the timetable in article 5 of the fsa, subject to acceleration of payment if one of the instalments was not paid: under the fsa, the opening of bankruptcy proceedings did not make the whole of the financial support (or such part as had not been repaid) immediately repayable by the purchaser, but repayment was according to the timetable in article 5, showing that this was not uncommercial in the eyes of the plaintiff and the defendant: at [43].9 the court accepted the plaintiff’s submission that on this reading a bankruptcy event would not produce an actual recovery of money which would not also be produced by the purchaser’s failure to pay an amount due under or in accordance with the fsa. it did not accept that it would be uncommercial that upon a bankruptcy event, the plaintiff could demand that the defendant pay “that amount” to it. on a textual reading, “that amount” was the amount due under or in accordance with the fsa which the purchaser had not paid: at [44].10 the court acknowledged the force of the plaintiff’s case that event (ii) produced no actual recovery of money which would not also be produced by event (i). however, while the presumption against surplusage was a well-established canon of construction, it was but an aid to construction, and could not justify giving words a meaning they would not bear: at [45]–[47].11 the plaintiff’s submission that the parties should be taken to have understood that upon event (i), the full amount of the financial support outstanding would become repayable, and that “that amount” was intended to refer to the amount that would thereby become repayable, did not fit with the trigger of failure to pay “any” amount, which extended to an amount such as damages for breach of the fsa; the amount in event (i) was not a conceptual amount that would become payable upon the failure to pay an instalment but a real amount that had become payable for any of a number of reasons: at [48].12 it was unnecessary to label any liability the defendant might have, or had incurred, as a primary or a secondary liability, and the plaintiff did not gain any assistance from the other clauses of the guarantee that it alluded to. the defendant promised to pay amounts payable by the purchaser; as at 31 may 2021 the amount of the financial support was not payable by the purchaser, and so it was not payable by the defendant: at [50].13 accordingly, the court rejected the plaintiff’s construction of cl 2.1 of the guarantee and dismissed the plaintiff’s claim of €7m and statutory interest from the defendant: at [53].14 the court observed that the purchaser in this case was not the defendant but alvance, an entity controlled by the defendant and not a signatory to the fsa. while the question of whether by french law, alvance would be bound under the fsa to make repayment according to its terms was raised during the hearing, it was unnecessary for the court to address it. even assuming in the plaintiff’s favour that alvance was not bound under the fsa to make repayment according to its terms, labelling the defendant’s liability as a primary liability for that reason did not advance the plaintiff’s position: at [51]–[52].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
