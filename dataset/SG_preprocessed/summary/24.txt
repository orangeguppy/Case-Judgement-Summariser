supreme court of singapore15 december 2023case summarythe republic of india v deutsche telekom ag [2023] sgca(i) 10civil appeal no. 1 of 2023-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the majority of the court of appeal comprising sundaresh menon cj, judith prakash jca, steven chong jca and robert french ij (judgment delivered by sundaresh menon cj):outcome: the court of appeal dismisses the appeal against the decision below in hc/os 8/2022 (“os 8”), rejecting the appellant’s attempt to resist enforcement of an investor-state arbitral award that was upheld before the seat court.pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  the court held that the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel could be applied by a singapore enforcement court when determining whether preclusive effect should be accorded to a prior seat court’s decision going towards the validity of an arbitral award. it is appropriate to apply transnational issue estoppel in the context of enforcement in international commercial arbitration as singapore’s conflict of laws rules include such principles and this also appropriately respects the parties’ choice of the arbitral seat in a principled manner: at [96]–[102].•  by way of obiter dicta, where transnational issue estoppel does not apply for some reason, or where a party wishes or chooses to invoke the primacy principle for any reason (including to avoid the time and expense in having to establish the technical requirements for invoking transnational issue estoppel), an enforcement court in singapore should nonetheless accord primacy to a prior decision of the seat court when enforcing an arbitral award. this was not an absolute principle and the court would need to resolve the further question of the weight to be placed on the seat court’s decision and the limits of this principle: at [120]–[130].•  the prior decision of the swiss seat court rejecting arguments previously raised by india for setting aside of the award gave rise to a transnational estoppel and india is precluded from re-litigating those same grounds in the present appeal: at [156]–[178].background to the appeal1 the present appeal was brought by the republic of india (“india”) against the dismissal of india’s application to set aside the ex parte order granting deutsche telekom ag (“dt”) leave to enforce a foreign arbitral award made against india (the “final award”) in os 8.2 on 2 september 2021, dt successfully applied for leave by way of hc/os 900/2021 (“os 900”) to enforce the final award in singapore, resulting in the issuance of hc/orc 4992/2021 (the “leave order”). india then applied to set aside the leave order. os 900 and the related proceedings were subsequently transferred to the singapore international commercial court (the “sicc”) as os 8. four applications were heard in os 8, including india’s application under hc/sum 155/2022 (“sum 155”) to set aside the leave order. 3 on 30 january 2023, the sicc dismissed all four summonses under os 8. the present appeal (“cas 1”) is india’s appeal against the dismissal of sum 155 and the order that it was to bear dt’s costs in sum 155.the material facts4 on 10 july 1995, india and germany entered into the “agreement between the federal republic of germany and the republic of india for the promotion and protection of investments” (the “india-germany bit”).5 on 28 january 2005, an indian company known as devas multimedia pte ltd (“devas”) and an indian state-owned entity, antrix corporation ltd (“antrix”), entered into an agreement (the “devas-antrix agreement”) for the leasing of india’s space segment capacity to devas and to collaborate on delivering multimedia and information services to mobile receivers through satellite and terrestrial systems. antrix was the marketing arm of india’s department of space and the entity through which the indian space research organisation engaged in commercial activities.6 dt subsequently invested in devas through its subsidiary, dt asia, acquiring shares in devas.7 sometime in or around 2009, india started to revisit the arrangements reflected in the devas-antrix agreement. on 25 february 2011, antrix notified devas of the termination of the devas-antrix agreement.8 on 2 september 2013, dt commenced arbitration (the “arbitration”) in geneva, switzerland against india contending that india’s annulment of the devas-antrix agreement was in breach of various provisions of the india-germany bit. on 13 december 2017, the tribunal (the “tribunal”) issued its interim award on jurisdiction and liability (the “interim award”), whereby it dismissed india’s objections to jurisdiction and found india liable for breaching its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under the india-germany bit to dt’s investment in devas.9 on 29 january 2018, india then applied to the seat court, the federal supreme court of switzerland (the “swiss federal supreme court”) to set aside the interim award primarily on the basis that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute (the “swiss setting-aside application”). amongst these arguments (hereafter referred to as the “grounds for resisting enforcement”) were that dt’s investment did not fall within the definition of “investment” under the india-german bit, there were violations of indian law in connection with dt’s investment (this argument was not squarely considered by the tribunal as india was found to have raised this belatedly), dt’s investment was made indirectly through a subsidiary of a different nationality other than those covered by the india-german bit and so does not fall within its scope, and india could invoke its essential security interests to terminate the devas-antrix agreement. on 11 december 2018, the swiss federal supreme court dismissed the application (the “swiss setting-aside decision”) finding that the tribunal had correctly concluded that it had jurisdiction under the india-germany bit.10 on 27 may 2020, the tribunal rendered its final award on quantum. on 2 may 2022, india applied to the swiss federal supreme court to revise and annul the interim award and the final award and to remit the matter to another tribunal (the “swiss revision application”). on 8 march 2023, the swiss federal supreme court dismissed the swiss revision application.11 the material issue before the singapore enforcement court was whether india could raise the same grounds for resisting enforcement which had already been fully argued but which failed before the seat court in the swiss federal supreme court.decision on appeal12 the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel can and should be applied by a singapore enforcement court when determining whether preclusive effect should be accorded to a seat court’s decision going towards the validity of an arbitral award: at [96].13 when dealing with the question of the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award, the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards (10 june 1958) 330 unts 38 does not operate in isolation. the domestic law of the enforcement court also comes into play, and this includes its conflict of laws rules and how it treats judgments that are relevant and rendered by other jurisdictions. singapore’s conflict of laws rules include the principles of transnational issue estoppel and it follows that the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel will apply in the arbitral context, especially as the international arbitration act 1994 (2020 rev ed) is silent on this issue and what is not governed by it must necessarily be governed by other rules of domestic laws. this respects the parties’ choice of the arbitral seat in a principled manner and coheres with the notion that courts co-exist as part of an international legal order within which they should respect each others’ decisions. further, this approach is readily accommodated within the existing legal framework of most common law jurisdictions and alleviates the problem of inconsistent judicial outcomes and re-litigation of matters determined by a court of competent jurisdiction: at [97]–[100].14 by differentiating between awards that are set aside on grounds that might find more “transnational” resonance (such as procedural irregularities) and grounds that have a distinctly “domestic” flavour, such as arbitrability or the violation of public policy, the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel can be applied in a manner that safeguards the domestic concerns of the enforcing court, while adhering to comity to the greatest extent possible: at [101].15 in applying the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel, caution should be exercised when interpreting judgments from a foreign legal system to determine: (a) what precisely was decided by the foreign court and whether the specific issue that is said to be the subject matter of an issue estoppel was a necessary, as opposed to a merely collateral, part of the foreign judgment; (b) whether the foreign court’s decision on that specific issue was final and conclusive; and (c) whether the party against whom the estoppel is invoked had the occasion or opportunity to raise that specific issue: at [133].16 it is not necessary in this case to resort to the principle that a decision of the seat court on matters that go to the validity of the award would enjoy primacy in the scheme of modern international arbitration (the “primacy principle”). however, the starting position in singapore should be that where transnational issue estoppel does not apply for some reason, or where a party wishes or chooses to invoke the primacy principle for any reason (including to avoid the time and expense in having to establish the technical requirements for invoking transnational issue estoppel), an enforcement court in singapore should nonetheless accord primacy to a prior decision of the seat court when enforcing an arbitral award. this is not an absolute principle and the court would need to resolve the further question of the weight to be placed on the seat court’s decision and the limits of the principle: at [120]–[123].17 as the international scheme governing the recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards accords a special status to the seat court which supervises the conduct of proceedings and which alone has the power to grant the active remedies, the primacy principle would only be relevant where there has been a prior seat court decision: at [124].18 several of the grounds for resisting enforcement relied on by india in cas 1 had previously been dismissed by the swiss federal supreme court when it considered the swiss setting-aside application. the swiss federal supreme court had affirmed the decision made by the tribunal to the extent that these issues had also been raised at the arbitration: at [134]–[154].19 india’s legal expert’s acceptance that a renewed application for setting aside based on the same grounds would be inadmissible in light of the swiss setting-aside decision, suggests that the swiss setting-aside decision as a whole as well as those grounds that had been unsuccessfully raised were final and conclusive before the swiss courts, such that india is precluded from seeking again to set aside the award on the same grounds as it had raised in its swiss setting-aside application. this was also the effect of the evidence of dt’s expert who contended that the swiss federal supreme court’s decision is final and conclusive in that the issue of the tribunal’s jurisdiction cannot be re-litigated before the swiss courts: at [165]–[173].20 a subsequent swiss court would not reconsider india’s grounds for resisting enforcement, these having already been considered and rejected in the swiss setting-aside decision. the swiss setting-aside decision is final and conclusive for the purposes of transnational issue estoppel: at [174]. 21 the remaining two limbs of the test for transnational issue estoppel are clearly made out. there is patent identity of the parties and the grounds for resisting enforcement raised in cas 1 are the same as those relied on before the seat court: at [175].22 india is precluded from re-litigating the grounds for resisting enforcement in the present appeal, and this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. for completeness, no exceptions to the doctrine of transnational issue estoppel arise in this case: at [176]–[178].23 it is thus unnecessary to consider the primacy principle: at [179].24 the sicc was correct to dismiss india’s application to resist enforcement: at [180].25 the sicc was correct to dismiss india’s argument that dt had not made full and frank disclosure in os 900: at [181]–[187].concurring judgment (delivered by jonathan hugh mance ij):26 the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that india is precluded by transnational issue estoppel and by the judgment of the swiss federal supreme court from relitigating the issues which it seeks to raise on this appeal: at [193].27 the question is whether and how the addition of a primacy principle to the court’s armaments could fit into the picture. first, the primacy principle is envisaged as effectively shadowing the whole area covered by issue estoppel and the principle in henderson v henderson and going potentially still wider. second, the suggested primacy principle can be disapplied in situations largely mirroring those in which there would be defences to recognition of an issue estoppel. third, a primacy principle would draw a sharp distinction between prior decisions of a seat court and prior decisions of another enforcement court, and such a distinction is not necessarily appropriate: at [198]–[201].28 the two tools of issue estoppel and the power in henderson v henderson are available and sufficient to enable justice to be done in cases where there has been a prior decision either of a court of the seat or of another enforcement court. it would suffice to rely on the tools which are already to hand, and not to give decisions of courts of the seat a specially elevated status in law in case of repeat challenges: at [214] and [221].29 short of any issue estoppel or abuse arising from the seat court’s decision or from a repeat attempt to challenge it, there is no room for a further principle of law (such as the primacy principle) precluding full consideration in an enforcement court of whatever issues arise: at [216].30 it was difficult to extract from the relevant authorities any principle of law by reference to which an enforcement court should refrain from addressing matters not the subject of any issue estoppel and not precluded from investigation on the basis that it would be abusive to relitigate them. a principle according to which an enforcement court must treat a prior decision of the seat court as determinative or presumptively determinative, short of some public policy consideration, or evident procedural failing, or evident error, appeared to bypass the first necessary enquiry for transnational issue estoppel, namely whether the prior court’s decision is preclusive: at [219]–[220].this summary is provided to
