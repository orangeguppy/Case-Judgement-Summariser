what matters was the actual value received and provided by the grantor: at [25] and [26].8 second, both the value of the consideration provided and the value of the consideration received by the grantor had to be assessed “in money or money’s worth”. this required the value of the consideration to be quantifiable in monetary terms, even if the precise monetary value could not be immediately determined with certainty. where the value of the consideration was precarious or speculative, some evidence would be needed to establish and quantify its value in monetary terms: at [30] and [34].9 the principle in the english case of re mc bacon ltd [1990] bclc 324 (“mc bacon”) should be adopted as part of singapore law, in preference to the approach in hill v spread trustee co ltd and another [2007] 1 wlr 2404. it was supported by the weight of authority and was also sound in principle. thus, the grant of security for the grantor’s existing debt would not constitute a transaction at an undervalue: at [39] and [40]. 10 nevertheless, the principle in mc bacon applied within, and not in the alternative to, the value comparison exercise in s 98(3)(c) of the ba. it therefore could not be applied as a blanket rule to all grants of security for existing debts. in particular, it did not apply where the relevant security was granted in respect of a third party’s existing debt. such a grant of security could, in principle, constitute a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(c) of the ba: at [42], [43] and [45].11 on the facts, there was no value received by pictorial and nsp in money or money’s worth which could be compared with the significant value provided by them. the value provided by pictorial and nsp was twofold: first, the legal mortgage securing aipl’s debt; and second, a new primary obligation to repay the loan which they assumed under the terms of the legal mortgage. as for the value received by pictorial and nsp, there was no evidence of pictorial and nsp receiving the value of the loan or any benefit therefrom that could be assessed in money or money’s worth. the benefit that rothstar claimed pictorial and nsp received from the loan was an unparticularised and unsubstantiated benefit which was said to accrue to them merely by dint of their association with aipl. the legal mortgage was therefore a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(c) of the ba: at [47] to [49] and [51]. 12 pictorial and nsp were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the legal mortgage. the liquidator and the private trustees were not estopped from arguing that the legal mortgage was liable to be avoided as a transaction at an undervalue, as this would subvert the statutory scheme of s 98 of the ba: at [53] to [55] and [59]. 13 the consequence of the legal mortgage being a transaction at an undervalue was not that it was “void”. under s 98(2) of the ba, the court had the power to make an order to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into. however, the transaction itself was not retrospectively avoided. the appropriate order was an order discharging the legal mortgage with prospective effect, without more: at [60], [61] and [66].voluntary conveyances to defraud creditors 14 the legal mortgage was not a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors under s 73b(1) of the conveyancing and law of property act (cap 61, 1994 rev ed). valid consideration had been provided by rothstar for the legal mortgage, in the form of both the discharge of the equitable mortgage and the loan extended to aipl. there was no evidence that pictorial and nsp had acted with the actual intent to defraud their creditors, and there was also nothing to suggest that rothstar had notice of any such intent at the relevant time: at [68], [71], [73] and [74].removal of the private trustees’ caveat15 once the legal mortgage was set aside, rothstar would cease to have any interest in the property as a registered legal mortgagee. it would then no longer be a “caveatee” to whom s 127(1) of the land titles act (cap 157, 2004 rev ed) (“the lta”) provided a remedy: at [76].16 rothstar’s submission that the private trustees lacked standing to lodge their caveat was misconceived as they had a clear entitlement to lodge and maintain their caveat under s 115(1) of the lta. in contrast, following the discharge of the legal mortgage, rothstar would have no interest in the property. the balance of convenience plainly lay in favour of maintaining the private trustees’ caveat: at [77] and [78].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s grounds of decision.
