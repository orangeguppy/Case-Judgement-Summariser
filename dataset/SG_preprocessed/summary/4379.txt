civil appeal no 28 of 2017





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



decision of the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh

menon):





outcome: coa dismissed appeal against decision that the appellant

had breached various by-laws by carrying out works on the common property

of a condominium development without the necessary approvals.



pertinent and significant points of the judgment



· coa held that the fact that an area had been demarcated as common

property on the strata title plan established that it was, at least on a

presumptive basis, part of the common property of the development: at    [39].




· the two limbs of the statutory definition of “common property” under s

2(1) of the building maintenance and strata management act were to be read

conjunctively: at [44].




· the second limb of the definition was to be interpreted broadly. it did

not require an area to be physically accessible by any of the subsidiary

proprietors. nor did it require the area to be currently used or enjoyed

the occupiers of two or more lots: at [60],    [61].




· the appeal was dismissed. the areas in which the appellant had carried

out works were common property. since the appellant had carried out the

works without prior authorisation of the respondent, such installation was

in breach of the relevant by-laws. the exception in by-law 5(3)(c)

did not apply: at [71], [80].


 


background to the appeal



1         civil appeal no 29 of 2017 was an appeal by sit kwong lam (“the

appellant”) against the decision of justice kannan ramesh (“the judge”) in    sit kwong lam v mcst plan no 2645 [2017] sghc 57.



facts



2          the appellant was a subsidiary proprietor of a penthouse unit (“the

unit”) of one of the towers of a condominium development (“the

development”). the respondent was the management corporation of the

development (“the respondent”).




3          in august 2013, the respondent discovered that the appellant had

installed timber decking on two ledges that bordered segments of the unit’s

external facades (“work 1”). the respondent concluded that work 1 entailed

the exclusive use of the common property of the development, which it had

no jurisdiction to authorise. thus, the respondent advised the appellant to

seek the necessary approval for work 1 at the next annual general meeting

(“agm”). the appellant initially did not pursue this course.




4          in may 2014, the respondent discovered that the appellant had covered the

entirety of a flat roof outside the unit with similar timber decking (“work

2”). further, the appellant had installed an air-conditioning ventilation

unit on an external wall enclosing the unit (“work 3”). works 1, 2, and 3

are collectively referred to as “the works”. the respondent requested that

the appellant remove or demolish “all unauthorised works”, but there was no

resolution.




5          in april 2015, the appellant tabled motions at an agm seeking the

exclusive use and enjoyment of, and/or special privileges in respect of,

the areas where the works had been carried out (collectively, “the areas”).

however, he failed to secure the requisite number of votes on any of the

motions.




6          on 30 june 2015, the appellant applied to the strata titles board (“stb”)

seeking a number of orders, including a declaration that he had not

breached any of the by-laws in having executed the works. on 11 february

2016, the stb dismissed his application.




7          on 10 march 2016, the appellant filed an appeal against the stb’s

decision pursuant to s 98(1) of the building maintenance and strata

management act (cap 30c, 2008 rev ed) (“bmsma”). the judge dismissed the

appeal. he held that the two limbs of the statutory definition of “common

property” under s 2(1) of the bmsma were to be read conjunctively. further,

the correct way to construe the second limb of the definition was to ask

whether the area in question was for the exclusive use of the occupiers of

the unit in question, in which case it would not be common property.

applying that test, the judge found that the areas were all common

property. further, the judge found that the appellant had, by installing

the works without the prior approval of the respondent, breached by-laws

8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the additional by-laws and by-law 5 of the prescribed

by-laws of the development.



decision on appeal



8          the court of appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal.




9          as a preliminary matter, the court of appeal noted that the fact that an

area in a development had been demarcated as common property on the

relevant strata title plan established that it was, at least on a

presumptive basis, part of the common property of the development. in such

circumstances, it would be for the party contending otherwise to prove that

the strata title plan was in error (at [39]).




10          the two limbs of the definition of “common property” under s 2(1)(a) of the bmsma were to be read conjunctively (at    [44]). this accorded with the text and structure of the

definition (at [46]), and nothing in the relevant

extraneous materials suggested that there was any legislative purpose

behind the definition that pointed away from its plain and clear meaning

(at [47]).




11        the bmsa did not envisage a third category of property in strata

developments that was neither part of the common property nor the property

of any individual subsidiary proprietor (at [54]).

however, the judge’s interpretation of the second limb of the definition of

“common property” could not be sustained (at [59]). the

second limb should be interpreted broadly (at [60]). any

area or feature that could affect the appearance of a building in the

development, or that was part and parcel of the fabric of the building,

could, by its mere presence, be “enjoyed” by the subsidiary proprietors of

the development. in order to be considered common property, there was no

need for the area or feature to be physically accessible by any of the

subsidiary proprietors (at [61]), or for it to be

currently used or enjoyed by the occupiers of two or more lots (at    [62]).




12         any area or feature in respect of which the management corporation had

assumed a duty to control, manage, administer, or maintain would

presumptively be taken to have satisfied the second limb of the statutory

definition of “common property”, unless it was shown that the management

corporation ought not to have assumed such a duty (at [63]

).




13          on the facts, the ledges on which work 1 had been constructed were part

and parcel of the fabric of the building. it did not matter that the ledges

were not physically accessible by any subsidiary proprietor. the ledges

were also not comprised in any lot. thus, the definition of “common

property” in s 2(1) of the bdsma was satisfied (at [66]).

the flat roof and wall on which works 2 and 3 had been installed were also

part and parcel of the building’s fabric, and the respondent had assumed

responsibility for their maintenance. they were not comprised in any lot.

thus, flat roof and wall both satisfied the definition of “common property”

(at [67]).




14          works 2 and 3 did not fall within the exception in by-law 5(3)(    c) of the prescribed by-laws. having regard to the other

exceptions in by-laws 5(3)(a), (b), and (d),

by-law 5(3)(c) must be limited to the situation where a subsidiary

proprietor erected a structure or device on common property in order to

prevent harm to children while they were within his lot (at    [74]). work 2 was not installed to prevent harm to the

appellant’s children while they were within his unit (at    [76]). in respect of work 3, there was insufficient

evidence of a direct correlation between the installation of the

air-conditioning ventilation unit and the prevention of harm to the

appellant’s children within the unit (at [80]).
