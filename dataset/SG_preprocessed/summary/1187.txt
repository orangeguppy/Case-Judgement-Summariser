2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the court of three judges (delivered by justice of the court of appeal andrew phang boon leong):outcome: the court of three judges sets aside the disciplinary tribunal’s finding that the respondent regulated foreign lawyer is guilty of misconduct unbefitting a member of an honourable profession in having assisted or permitted his client to act in a manner he considered dishonest or ought to have considered dishonest. pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  it was not dishonest of a lawyer not to transfer a sum of money to an opposing party if the lawyer had no obligation to do so to begin with: at [68] to [69].•  absent criminal behaviour or any conduct that gave rise to a civil claim against the lawyer himself (such as dishonest assistance of a breach of trust), a lawyer did not act “dishonestly” or in a manner that was “unbefitting” a lawyer if that lawyer was complying with the client’s instructions to facilitate a breach of contract or other private obligation, as a lawyer had a duty to his client to act with undivided loyalty: at [87] and [94(a)].•  a lawyer was also not ethically obliged to “whistle-blow” on his client to an opposing party (for example, by informing the opposing party that the lawyer’s client was intending to breach a private obligation vis-à-vis the opposing party), as this would contravene the lawyer’s own legal and ethical obligations of confidentiality and loyalty to his own client: at [58] to [65] and [94(b)].•  when a lawyer’s client wished to breach a private obligation, the lawyer should seek to properly advise and dissuade the client from committing such a breach: at  [88] and [94(c)].•  generally, the lawyer should not be the party to suggest to the client to commit the breach of the client’s contractual or other private obligation: at [89] and [94(d)].•  generally, the lawyer should not be involved in assisting or committing the client’s breach of the latter’s private obligation: at [90] to [92] and [94(e)].•  if a lawyer’s client insisted on committing any acts which would require the lawyer to act in a manner that is dishonest or unbefitting of a member of an honourable profession, the lawyer should apply to discharge himself as counsel for the client: at [93] and [94(f)].background to the appeal1 mr nicky tan ng kuang and ms lim siew soo (collectively, the “applicants”) were the judicial managers of two companies, punj lloyd pte ltd (“plpl”) and sembawang engineers and constructors pte ltd (“sec”) (collectively, the “companies”). the respondent, mr jai swarup pathak (“mr pathak”), is a regulated foreign lawyer who has been the partner-in-charge of gibson, dunn & crutcher llp’s (“gibson dunn”) singapore office and the pacific asia region since 2008. at the material time from june 2016 to november 2016, mr pathak and mr robson lee from gibson dunn acted for punj lloyd limited (“pll”). pll is a company listed in india and the sole shareholder of plpl, which in turn was the sole shareholder of sec. 2 mr pathak was convicted by disciplinary tribunal no 4a of 2020 (“dt4a”) of one charge of misconduct unbefitting a regulated foreign lawyer as a member of an honourable profession under s 83a(2)(g) of the legal profession act (cap 161, 2009 rev ed) (“lpa”) for his role in assisting or permitting his client, pll, to act in a manner he considered dishonest or ought to have considered dishonest. the charge (“charge 1a”) stipulated that this was so because mr pathak failed to pay the applicants two tranches of s$250,000 deposited by pll with gibson dunn when the applicants made written demands on 2 september 2016 for payment of the first tranche of s$250,000 and on 22 september 2016 for payment of the total sum of s$500,000. 3 this sum of s$500,000 was purportedly deposited with gibson dunn by pll as part of an agreement between the applicants and pll, reached through mr pathak, that pll would provide s$2 million to fund the costs of managing the companies whilst under judicial management (“jm”) and to enable the judicial managers to “change the narrative” in respect of pll (“deposit agreement”). mr pathak disputed the existence of the deposit agreement. it was also mr pathak’s position that pll had instructed gibson dunn to cease acting for pll in relation to the negotiation of the judicial managers’ fees, and that pll would deal directly with the applicants regarding their fees. pll also instructed gibson dunn that the s$500,000 sum deposited by pll with gibson dunn could be used to pay pll’s outstanding invoices with gibson dunn instead. this was therefore done instead, and pll never once instructed gibson dunn to transfer the s$500,000 sum to the applicants. the dt4a determined that a cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, and the applicants brought this application for an order that a penalty of between s$50,000 and s$100,000 be imposed on mr pathak.the court of three judges’ decision4 the court of three judges set aside the dt4a’s finding that mr pathak was guilty of charge 1a.was there a deposit agreement?5 having carefully considered the evidence, the court of three judges was unable to accept mr pathak’s submission that there was no concluded deposit agreement and that the s$500,000 sum received by gibson dunn was instead merely a “good faith deposit” by pll. the contemporaneous objective record showed that mr pathak had unequivocally confirmed that there was an agreement by pll to deposit s$2 million with gibson dunn for the judicial managers’ fees. in this regard, the court of three judges noted that, while the dt4a’s finding was that the s$2 million sum was for the “costs of the companies under judicial management”, the contemporaneous objective record showed that the specific agreement was not that the s$2 million deposit would be used for the costs of the judicial management, but that it would be used for the judicial managers’ fees instead: at [42].6 in the email correspondence, mr pathak had used the term “trust” extensively to describe the money deposited with gibson dunn by pll. while it was not the applicants’ case that the s$500,000 sum was held on trust, and it was mr pathak’s prerogative to run his case in whatever manner he chooses, it was inconsistent with mr pathak’s standing as a senior lawyer who was a member of an honourable profession that he had attempted to resile from the clear terms of his own emails and run a case in these disciplinary proceedings that the s$500,000 sum was merely a “good faith” deposit. nevertheless, since it was not the applicants’ case that the s$500,000 sum was held by mr pathak on trust for the applicants, the court of three judges did not say any more on this matter: at [44] to [46].knowledge and receipt7 the court of three judges found that it was clear from mr pathak’s emails that mr pathak knew of the deposit agreement, as he had repeatedly used explicit terms to “confirm” that the “trust” deposit of s$2 million had been placed with gibson dunn by pll for the “jm fees”: at [48].8 the court of three judges also found that the clear terms of mr pathak’s own emails demonstrated that the two tranches of s$250,000 had been received by gibson dunn as part of the deposit agreement for the judicial managers’ fees: at [50] and [51].dishonesty9 a lawyer was not a mere “legal mercenary” or a “hired gun”. mr pathak owed a duty to the applicants under r 8(3) of the legal profession (professional conduct) rules 2015 (cap 161, s 706/2015) (“pcr”) “not [to] take unfair advantage of any person” and not to act towards any person “in a way which [was] fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an honourable profession”. as the applicants were unrepresented, mr pathak also owed a duty under r 8(2) of the pcr to decline to give the applicants legal advice and to “take reasonable steps” to ensure that the applicants were not under the impression that their interests were protected by mr pathak. in this case, it was never the applicants’ case that mr pathak had breached r 8 of the pcr, so there was no basis to conclude so: at [55] to [57].10 the court of three judges rejected the applicants’ submission that, even if the decision to use the s$500,000 sum for pll’s outstanding invoices with gibson dunn had emanated from pll, mr pathak should have informed the applicants that the s$500,000 sum was no longer designated for the original purpose of the deposit agreement. mr pathak was not the applicants’ counsel. beyond the duties under r 8 of the pcr, mr pathak did not owe any legal or ethical duty to serve the applicants’ interests. on the other hand, mr pathak had a fundamental legal and ethical duty to maintain and protect the confidentiality of pll’s instructions and intended course of action. if pll had instructed mr pathak that it intended to breach the deposit agreement and to use the s$500,000 sum to pay its outstanding invoices with gibson dunn instead, mr pathak had a duty to maintain the confidentiality of this instruction. mr pathak’s duties owed to the applicants did not override his fundamental duty of confidentiality to his client, pll: at [53] to [54] and [58] to [63].11 a lawyer, as a fiduciary to his client, also owed a duty of “unflinching loyalty” to his client. this buttressed the foregoing point that it could not be right that mr pathak had a duty to inform the applicants that the s$500,000 sum was no longer being deposited with gibson dunn for the purpose of the deposit agreement: at [64] to [65].12 the impugned act in charge 1a was the act of “not paying each of the tranches [of s$250,000] to the [applicants] when [they] made a written demand for them” [emphasis added]. there could be no dishonesty on mr pathak’s part in not paying the s$500,000 sum to the applicants if he had no duty to do so in the first place. the court of three judges held that that was clearly the situation in this case. it was undisputed that the sum of s$500,000 was not subject to an escrow or stakeholding agreement. it was also not the applicants’ case that the s$500,000 sum was held on trust for the applicants. there was also no solicitor’s undertaking by mr pathak to hold the s$500,000 sum for the applicants. therefore, there was no obligation on mr pathak’s part in september 2016 to transfer the s$500,000 sum to the applicants. mr pathak’s obligation in september 2016, pursuant to the deposit agreement, was to hold the s$500,000 sum as a deposit for the judicial managers’ fees, and to only pay them to the applicants when their fees as judicial managers had been raised for payment. therefore, charge 1a was clearly unsustainable and must be set aside: at [68] to [69].13 the court of three judges observed that, even in a civil context, while a lawyer had a duty to serve his client’s interests, including complying with a client’s instructions to breach a contract, that was subject to the following important caveats: at [86] to [94].a. absent criminal behaviour or any conduct that gave rise to a civil claim against the lawyer himself (for example, dishonest assistance of a breach of trust or the tort of inducement to breach a contract), a lawyer did not act “dishonestly” or in a manner that was “unbefitting” a lawyer if that lawyer was complying with the client’s instructions to facilitate a breach of contract or other private obligation, as a lawyer had a duty to his client to act with undivided loyalty: at [87] and [94(a)].b. a lawyer was also not ethically obliged to “whistle-blow” on his client to an opposing party (for example, by informing the opposing party that the lawyer’s client was intending to breach a private obligation vis-à-vis the opposing party), as this would contravene the lawyer’s own legal and ethical obligations of confidentiality and loyalty to his own client: at [58] to [65] and [94(b)].c. the foregoing principles were subject to the important caveat that, when a lawyer’s client wished to breach a private obligation, the lawyer should seek to properly advise and dissuade the client from committing such a breach: at [87] to [88] and [94(c)].d. generally, the lawyer should also not be the party to suggest to the client to commit the breach of the client’s contractual or other private obligation: at [89] and [94(d)].e. generally, the lawyer should not be involved in assisting or committing the client’s breach of the latter’s private obligation: at [90] to [92] and [94(e)].f. if a lawyer’s client insisted on committing any acts which would require the lawyer to act in a manner that was dishonest or unbefitting of a member of an honourable profession, the lawyer should apply to discharge himself as counsel for the client: at [93] and [94(f)].14 thus, in this case, it would have been a very different situation if the idea to change the purpose of the s$500,000 deposit had come from mr pathak himself. if so, mr pathak would, at least, have been guilty of a breach of r 5(2)(j) of the pcr (which states that a lawyer can only “use all legal means to advance the client’s interests …” [emphasis added]) and misconduct unbefitting a regulated foreign lawyer under s 83a(2)(g) of the lpa. however, that was not how the case was run against mr pathak before the dt4a. therefore, the court of three judges did not pursue this issue further: at [95] to [96] and [101] to [102].charges 2aa and 2bb15 while the parties did not address the court of three judges on charges 2aa and 2bb, for completeness, the court observed that those charges might not be made out as well, as the alleged act of dishonesty in those charges were also not made out: at [103] to [106].16 having regard to all the circumstances, each party was ordered to bear their own costs of the hearing before the court of three judges: at [107].this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s judgment. it is not intended to be a
