magistrate’s appeal no 9366 of 2017
_____________________________________________________________________
decision of the high court (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon):
outcome: high court allows appeal against sentence and substitutes 24-month supervised probation term for four-month imprisonment term, holding that the appellant, who was 17 at the time of his offences but 22 when sentenced, should be considered a youthful offender. 
 
pertinent and significant points of the decision


rehabilitation is presumptively the primary sentencing consideration where an offender is 21 or below at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing. in contrast, this is not the case where an offender is above 21 at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, unless the offender happens to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exist other exceptional circumstances: at [33], [34] and [44].


where there is a substantial lapse of time between the commission of the offence and the offender’s subsequent sentencing, the delay might be relevant either: (a) where it can be shown that there was undue delay that prejudiced the offender, thereby warranting the imposition of a more lenient sentence as a matter of fairness to the offender; or (b) where it affords the court the opportunity to assess the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period for the purposes of assessing what is the most appropriate sentence to impose: at [49].


in dealing with an offender who is 21 or below at the time of the offence, but above that age by the time of sentencing, the court should examine all the facts of the case – including the offender’s actual age at each of these two points in time, the length of the delay between them, and the available evidence of the trajectory of the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period – and determine, in the light of these facts, whether it is appropriate to treat the offender as a youthful offender such that the presumption that rehabilitation is the key sentencing consideration continues to apply: at [58].


a probation officer’s recommendations generally ought to carry considerable weight, and the court should ordinarily be slow to depart from these recommendations unless: (a) it is clear that the circumstances upon which the recommendations were based were factually incorrect or have since changed materially; or (b) there was no proper basis for the recommendations: at [78] and [79]. 


 
background to the appeal
1          this was an appeal by a 23-year-old appellant (“the appellant”) against the four-month imprisonment term imposed on him by a district judge (“the district judge”) for one charge under s 420 read with s 116 of the penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed) of abetting, by conspiracy, the cheating of a motor insurance company. the appellant had consented to a similar charge pertaining to another motor insurance company being taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. 
 
the material facts
2          in june 2012, the appellant, who was then 17 years old, was recruited by a group of motor insurance fraudsters to obtain a medical certificate from a doctor by falsely claiming that he had injured his back while seated as a rear passenger in a vehicle that had been involved in a traffic accident between three vehicles. after obtaining the medical certificate, the appellant was brought to a law firm to file personal injury claims against two motor insurance companies. neither company made payment on those claims. investigations subsequently revealed that property damage and personal injury claims were made by other individuals who claimed to be drivers and passengers of the other vehicles involved in the same accident, which had in fact been deliberately staged. the appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of abetment of cheating for his participation in the fraudulent scheme.
3          on 20 november 2017, the appellant, who was by then 22 years old, pleaded guilty to one of the two charges brought against him, and consented to the other charge being taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. the district judge declined to call for a probation pre-sentencing report as he did not consider probation appropriate, and sentenced the appellant to four months’ imprisonment. 
4          on appeal by the appellant, after the high court (“the court”) heard the parties’ initial submissions on 3 april 2018, it adjourned the proceedings to obtain a probation pre-sentencing report on the appellant. in a report dated 7 may 2018 (“the report”), the investigating probation officer, ms ho li ling (“ms ho”), assessed the appellant to be suitable for probation, and recommended that he undergo 24 months of supervised probation with certain accompanying conditions.
 
the court’s decision
5          at a subsequent hearing on 5 july 2018 after ms ho submitted the report, the court agreed with ms ho’s recommendations and allowed the appeal, ordering the appellant to be placed on 24 months’ supervised probation with effect from 5 july 2018, subject to: (a) a daily time restriction from 11pm to 6am; (b) a requirement that the appellant undertake 200 hours of community service; and (c) a requirement that the appellant’s mother be bonded in the sum of $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour throughout the 24-month term of probation: at [2] and [84].
6          the court considered that the district judge erred in failing to obtain a probation pre-sentencing report before deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose. when a court deals with the sentencing of a youthful offender, that is to say, an offender aged 21 or below, it should generally call for a probation pre-sentencing report before imposing the sentence, and should not embark on an assessment of the offender’s suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report, unless: (a) the basic prerequisites for probation to be considered are not met; or (b) the court is clearly satisfied that probation is not a realistic option on the facts of the case. neither situation applied in this case: at [20] and [21].
7          the law takes a presumptive view that where youthful offenders are concerned, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation. in contrast, this is not the case for offenders above the age of 21, unless the particular offender concerned happens to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exist other exceptional circumstances: at [33], [34] and [44]. 
8          two rationales underlie the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offenders – the retrospective rationale, which seeks to justify rehabilitation for a young offender on account of his youthful folly and inexperience, and which rests on the offender’s age at the time of the offence; and the prospective rationale, which seeks to justify rehabilitation on the grounds of a young offender’s receptiveness to a rehabilitative sentencing regime, the benefit to society from his rehabilitation, as well as the disproportionate suffering endured by a young offender as compared to an adult offender when exposed to the typical punitive options, and which rests on the offender’s age at the time of sentencing: at [37]–[42].
9          if an offender is 21 years old or below at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, both the retrospective and the prospective rationales would apply. conversely, if an offender is above the age of 21 at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, neither rationale would apply: at [44]. 
10        as for offenders at or below the age of 21 at the time of the offence but above that age by the time of sentencing, the prospective rationale would not apply as strongly, if at all, while the retrospective rationale would continue to be relevant. the appropriate approach that the court should take in relation to such offenders is to examine all the facts of the case – including the offender’s actual age at each of these two points in time, the length of the delay between them, and the available evidence of the trajectory of the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period – and determine, in the light of these facts, whether it is appropriate to treat the offender as a youthful offender such that the presumption that rehabilitation is the key sentencing consideration continues to apply: at [45] and [58].
11        in the present case, there were several reasons why it was appropriate to consider the appellant a youthful offender for sentencing purposes such that rehabilitation would presumptively remain the key sentencing consideration. first, although the prospective rationale did not apply to the appellant as strongly given that he was already 22 at the time of sentencing, the retrospective rationale continued to be relevant as the appellant was only 17 when he committed his offences. second, the appellant, being older now, might have become mature enough to appreciate the significance of the rehabilitative sanction meted out to him. third, there was, in this case, a substantial lapse of time between the appellant’s commission of his offences and his subsequent sentencing by the district judge. although, on the facts, this delay did not constitute a basis for imposing a more lenient sentence on the appellant as a matter of fairness to him, it gave the court the opportunity to assess his rehabilitative progress during the intervening period, and the evidence in this regard indicated that he was making a concerted effort to mend his ways with the help of his family. fourth, the appellant was only just slightly above the threshold age of 21 at the time of sentencing: at [47]–[49], [55], [57] and [58].
12        the sentencing of youthful offenders proceeds in two stages. at the first stage, the court is concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. while rehabilitation is presumptively the dominant consideration when sentencing youthful offenders, its primacy may be diminished where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable do not exist. as regards the last factor, the court should consider whether the individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high so as to outweigh the concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation. at the second stage, the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal: at [64]–[67].
13        applying the two-stage framework to the appellant, where the first stage was concerned, rehabilitation should retain its primacy. this was because, first, although the appellant’s offences were serious, the actual harm which they caused was not severe. second, the appellant was not a hardened or recalcitrant offender. third, the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing a viable option were present in this case, given that ms ho’s findings in the report showed that the appellant evinced a capacity for rehabilitation that was demonstrably high. as regards the second stage, probation was the most appropriate sentence to impose, especially given the appellant’s “very low” risk of reoffending: at [68]–[71] and [73]–[75].
14        the duration and conditions of probation recommended by ms ho should be accepted in lieu of those suggested by the appellant. a probation officer’s recommendations generally ought to carry considerable weight, and the court should ordinarily be slow to depart from these recommendations unless: (a) it is clear that the circumstances upon which the recommendations were based were factually incorrect or have since changed materially; or (b) there was no proper basis for the recommendations. in the present case, the appellant relied on the latter factor to seek a departure from ms ho’s recommendations. these recommendations did not, however, lack proper basis – they were made by ms ho, having already considered the progress made by the appellant since the commission of his offences in june 2012. further, and more fundamentally, the probation term and the accompanying conditions were not simply restrictions and inconveniences imposed on the appellant as punishment for his offences. instead, they reflected society’s willingness to pour valuable resources into remoulding and reconstructing the appellant’s future, and constituted a societal response that should be embraced, rather than shunned, by the appellant: at [77]–[81] and [83].
