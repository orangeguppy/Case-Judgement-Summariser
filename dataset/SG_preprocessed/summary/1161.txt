threshold of substantial injustice will not easily be met and will certainly not be satisfied simply because the law has changed (at [6], [73] and [111]).•  an injustice may be said to have arisen in one of two ways:o where an applicant seeks to set aside his conviction, an injustice will only have arisen if the new material strikes at the soundness of the conviction in a fundamental way (at [71(a)(i)] and [74]).o where an applicant seeks to challenge his sentence, an injustice will only have arisen if the new material shows that the earlier decision was based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law (at [71(a)(ii)] and [79]).•  an injustice may be said to be substantial under the following circumstances:o an applicant may establish substantial injustice if the new material points to a powerful probability that his conviction is unsound and no comparable offence has been committed (at [71(b)(i)] and [82]).o where the new material shows that the earlier decision was based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law, any resulting injustice will only be considered substantial if the said misapprehension had a significant bearing on the sentence imposed (at [71(b)(ii)] and [83]). background facts1 the prosecution filed these applications following the court of appeal’s decision in saravanan chandaram v public prosecutor and another matter [2020] 2 slr 95 (“saravanan”). in saravanan, the court held that where a single compressed block of cannabis-related plant material had been certified to contain (a) cannabis and (b) fragmented vegetable matter containing cannabinol (“cbn”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“thc”), it was impermissible for the prosecution to prefer both (a) a charge in respect of the portion certified to consist purely of cannabis, and (b) a charge in respect of the portion consisting of fragmented vegetable matter that had been found to contain cbn and thc (hereafter referred to as the “dual charging practice”).2 the respondents in these applications had been charged with and convicted pursuant to the prosecution’s “dual charging practice”. following the decision in saravanan, the prosecution filed these applications inviting the court of appeal to review its previous decisions in relation to the respondents. however, the prosecution subsequently sought leave to withdraw the applications on the basis that the respondents’ cases had been properly decided in accordance with the prevailing law at the time.3 although the court of appeal granted the prosecution leave to withdraw the applications, it went on to consider the applicable threshold for reopening a concluded decision in the light of a subsequent change in the law.the court of appeal’s grounds of decisionthe finality of court decisions4 the starting point was that court judgments, and particularly decisions in concluded criminal appeals, were final and could not be reopened on their merits (at [7], [8] and [33]). it followed from the principle of finality that a matter ordinarily could not be reopened just because there had been a change in the law (at [8] and [13]).5 however, the default position of finality could be departed from in appropriate cases by invoking: (a) the court of appeal’s inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal; or (b) an appellate court’s statutory power to review its earlier decision under s 394i of the criminal procedure code (cap 68, 2012 rev ed) (“the cpc”) (at [13]).the court’s inherent and statutory powers of review6 as held in kho jabing v public prosecutor [2016] 3 slr 135 (“kho jabing”), the court of appeal would only exercise its inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal if there was sufficient material on which it could conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice (at [21]). material would only be considered “sufficient” if it was “new” and “compelling” (at [21]). “new” material could take the form of new legal arguments made following a change in the law (at [21]). “compelling” material referred to material that was “reliable, substantial and powerfully probative” and that could show “almost conclusively” that there had been a “miscarriage of justice” (at [22]). 7 under s 394i of the cpc, an appellate court had the power to review its earlier decision (at [26]). a subsequent change in the law could constitute the basis for a review application under s 394i of the cpc (at [32]). since s 394j of the cpc codified the requirements set out in kho jabing, an applicant’s choice between the court’s statutory and inherent powers of review did not typically affect the substance of a review application (at [27] and [30]).the conditions under which an appellate court could reopen an earlier decision in the light of a subsequent change in the law8 there was a dearth of local authorities on the conditions under which an appellate court might reopen the merits of an earlier decision following a change in the law (at [34]–[35]). the court of appeal thus drew guidance from the english authorities on the analogous issue of granting leave to appeal out of time following a change in the law (at [35]).9 having considered the english authorities, the court of appeal held that an appellate court could only reopen an earlier decision (or grant leave to appeal out of time) when it had been presented with new material that gave rise to a powerful probability that substantial injustice had arisen (at [70]). in this context, the new material would likely be new legal arguments based on changes in the law that occurred after the appellate court had rendered its decision (at [70]). the high threshold of substantial injustice would not easily be met and would certainly not be satisfied simply because the law had changed (at [6], [73] and [111]). 10 an injustice could be said to have arisen in one of two ways. where an applicant sought to set aside his conviction, an injustice would only have arisen if the new material struck at the soundness of the conviction in a fundamental way (at [71(a)(i)] and [74]). in other words, the new material had to give rise to a powerful probability that no offence had been committed at [76]). such new material would typically arise in the light of subsequent changes in the law as to the constituent elements of an offence and/or the proper interpretation of statutory provisions that generated criminal liability (at [76]). matters of procedural fairness (or criminal procedure) did not typically go towards the soundness of a conviction (at [78]). 11 where an applicant sought to challenge his sentence, an injustice would only have arisen if the new material showed that the earlier decision was based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law (at [71(a)(ii)] and [79]).12 not only must an injustice have arisen, but the injustice also had to be substantial (at [71] and [81]). an applicant would have established substantial injustice if he showed that there was a powerful probability that his conviction was unsound and if the facts did not disclose any other offence of comparable gravity (at [71(b)(i)] and [82]). conversely, even where an applicant showed that his conviction was unsustainable, he would have failed to establish substantial injustice if he could have been charged with or convicted of other offences of comparable gravity despite the change in the law (at [65(d)] and [82]).13 where the impugned decision was one on sentence, any injustice (arising from a fundamental misapprehension of the law) would only be considered substantial if the said misapprehension had a significant bearing on the sentence imposed (at [71(b)(ii) and [83]].14 applicants seeking to rely on a change in the law ought to file their review applications with all due urgency (at [85]). the longer the delay between the change in the law and the filing of the review application, the more it could presumptively be said that the applicant had deliberately chosen not to challenge the earlier decision against him, and the more difficult it would likely be for him to prove that he had suffered substantial injustice (at [85]). the court would consider the length of time that had elapsed and the reasons advanced to explain any delay (at [85]).15 the court of appeal’s approach was aligned with s 394j of the cpc and its decision in kho jabing, and was consonant with the cases in which an appellate court had revisited an earlier decision following a change in the law (at [72]–[73], [86], [92]–[95] and [97]–[100]). the court of appeal further observed that would be exceedingly rare for applicants to establish substantial injustice based on the change in the law occasioned by saravanan (at [88]–[90]).the avenues by which the court could revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law16 there were three ways for the court to revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law. first, where a decision had not been appealed against previously, an appellate court could grant an offender leave to appeal out of time (at [91]–[92]). second, where an appeal against a lower court’s decision had already been disposed of, the appellate court could either exercise its inherent power to review the concluded appeal or grant the offender leave to make a review application (at [91] and [96]). third, the court of appeal could exercise its power to review any matter on its own motion, although this exceptional power had not hitherto been exercised (at [91], [103] and [104]).the present applications17 no substantial injustice had arisen in respect of the respondents in ca/cm 12/2020 (“cm 12”) and ca/cm 13/2020 (“cm 13”) (at [123] and [129]). setting aside the cannabis mixture charge would have made no difference to the sentence imposed on the respondent in cm 12 (at [123]). further, the sentence imposed on the respondent in cm 13 was very much on the lenient side to begin with (at [128]–[129]).18 the respondents in ca/cm 11/2020 (“cm 11”) and ca/cm 14/2020 (“cm 14”) could not be allowed to take advantage of the decision in saravanan without having to consider how the prosecution might have acted had it appreciated the legal position in saravanan earlier (at [117]–[119] and [133]). given that the prosecution might well have exercised its prosecutorial discretion differently by proceeding on capital charges, or in the case of the respondent in cm 11, on a different combination of charges such as would yield at least the same aggregate sentence that was imposed, no substantial injustice had arisen in relation to the respondents in cm 11 and cm 14 (at [116], [119], [120], [133] and [135]). 19 the court of appeal noted that saravanan was a departure from its previous decision in which it had held that the “dual charging practice” was permissible (at [134]). the principle of finality militated against the reopening of cases that were concluded in accordance with the pre-saravanan legal position, which was good law for nearly 24 years (at [134]).this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision. it is not intended to be a substitute for
