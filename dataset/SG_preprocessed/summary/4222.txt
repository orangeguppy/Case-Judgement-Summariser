civil appeal no 100 of 2017
_____________________________________________________________________
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by judge of appeal tay yong kwang):
1          this appeal arose from an action for the payment of rent due under a lease over certain units (“the premises”) in kallang wave mall. the tenant’s defence was that the landlord had misrepresented that the premises could be used for the operation of a pub, bar and club with live entertainment when the landlord had not obtained the requisite permission for these uses from the relevant authorities.
2          the high court judge (“the judge”) accepted that the landlord had misrepresented that the appellant would be able to operate a pub, bar and club providing live entertainment services at the premises. however, the judge held that the tenant affirmed the contract after it had discovered the misrepresentations and was therefore not entitled to rescind it. the tenant appealed.
3          the court of appeal dismissed the tenant’s appeal. it held that where misrepresentation is alleged in a contract and the representee has taken steps which are ostensibly and objectively acts of affirmation of the contract, it is not necessary for the representee to know that he has a legal right to affirm or to rescind the contract before he can be said to have affirmed the contract. it is sufficient that the representee has knowledge of the relevant facts which entitle him to rescind the contract, irrespective of whether he also knows that he has the said legal right.
 
other alleged representations on operating hours and take-out services
4          the court upheld the judge's finding that the respondent had not made any other misrepresentations. the respondent had not represented that the appellant would be able to operate its business at the premises until the early hours of the morning. in any event, the appellant would not have relied on any such representation. it knew that the operating hours for selling alcohol and providing live entertainment were contingent upon the authorities’ grant of the relevant licences. the letter of offer and the lease agreement made clear that the responsibility lay with the appellant to apply for these licences ([34]–[36]).
5          there was no evidence of any representations that the appellant would be able to provide take-out food and beverage services for events and attendees at the singapore sports hub when in fact, users were prohibited from bringing outside food and beverages into the sports facilities at the sports hub ([37]–[40]).
 
affirmation of the lease agreement
6          the court held that that the appellant’s conduct evinced a clear and unequivocal intention to affirm the lease agreement despite the respondent’s misrepresentations regarding live entertainment. the appellant signed the lease agreement without making any qualifications more than a month after it received word of the ura’s decision. it made no protest when taking possession of the premises, commencing business and paying rent. there was no evidence of any “gentlemen’s agreement” between the parties to renegotiate the rent, nor any evidence of the appellant’s alleged intention that its affirmation was only conditional upon reduction in rent ([44]–[47]).
7          the court held that it was not necessary for the respondent to show that the appellant knew of its legal right to rescind the lease agreement when it did the acts in apparent affirmation of that agreement despite having known about the misrepresentation. it was sufficient that it knew of the facts giving rise to its right of rescission. this position is in line with policy considerations and the general principle that no one should be allowed to benefit from his ignorance of the law. it also avoids considerable practical difficulties such as requiring a representor to inquire and seek confirmation that the representee is aware of his legal rights when he is faced with what ostensibly and objectively are acts of affirmation as well as to find objective and admissible evidence of the representee’s state of mind ([61]–[64]).
8          in any event, the court saw no reason to depart from the judge’s finding that the appellant was aware of its legal right of rescission when it affirmed the lease agreement. certain whatsapp messages between the parties’ representatives indicated that the appellant knew that it could have walked away from the lease agreement without being in breach ([67]–[68]).
9          the appeal was therefore dismissed.
