justice tan siong thye):outcome: hc dismisses claim for legal fees by advocate and solicitor who was unauthorised to practise law, and allows defendants’ counterclaims for sale proceeds of shares held

claim for fees charged in respect of acts done as an advocate or solicitor: at [76] and [86]. •  an unauthorised person cannot claim any remuneration for work that he was employed to do as an advocate and solicitor; work that falls within any of the specific categories in s 33 of the lpa (such as preparing documents relating to court proceedings); and work that is customarily within the exclusive function of advocates and solicitors to provide (such as giving advice on legal rights and obligations): at [84].  •  in a contract for services, absent any agreement to the contrary, the cause of action accrues under s 6(1)(a) of the limitation act (cap 163, 1996 rev ed) when the work under the contract is completed: at [168] to [169]. background to the dispute 1 the plaintiff, mr choo cheng tong wilfred (“mr choo”), was admitted as an advocate and solicitor in 1989. however, from 1 april 2000 to 31 march 2006 and from 1 april 2014 onwards, he did not have a valid practising certificate in force and was an “unauthorised person” under s 32(2)(b) of the lpa.  2 the defendants, mr phua swee khiang (“mr phua”) and mr ding pei chai (“mr ding”), had collaborated with mr lee wan hoi (“mr lee”) to invest in several properties in melbourne (the “melbourne properties”) in 1993 and 1994. these properties were sold in or around july 2000. the capital which the defendants had invested was returned to them by mr lee by 27 october 2000, and part of the sale proceeds were set aside in a bank account (the “acu account”) to meet various contingent liabilities.     3 mr choo was appointed by the defendants in 2000–2001 to assist them with their legal disputes relating to the melbourne properties, including a dispute with mr lee. these legal disputes included court proceedings in singapore (namely, interpleader proceedings in os 601786/2001 (“os 601”) and os 902/2002, and suit 420/2014), australia, and the british virgin islands. it was undisputed that the defendants had entered into two written agreements with mr choo relating to his services and remuneration: a consultancy agreement in 2003 and a tripartite agreement in 2012.4 in 2002, mr choo received 3.53 million shares in atech holdings limited (the “atech shares”) from mr phua as security for the payment of his fees. he was to hold the atech shares on trust for mr phua. subsequently, mr choo sold the atech shares.   5 in 2016, the defendants settled their dispute with mr lee and recovered a sum of us$1.04m from the acu account. 6 in the present suit, mr choo claimed that he had provided law-related business consultancy services to the defendants and that he was entitled to approximately s$2.09m from the defendants for work done under various alleged agreements from 2000 to 2018: a. an oral agreement made in september 2000 for mr phua to pay mr choo a fixed fee of s$50,000 for his services in relation to the recovery of the capital from the investments in the melbourne properties (the “melbourne capital agreement”);b. an oral agreement made in september 2000 for mr phua to pay mr choo hourly rates of s$800 or s$1,200 per hour for his services in relation to the recovery of the profits from the investments in the melbourne properties (the “melbourne profits agreement (phua)”); c. an oral agreement made in december 2000 for mr phua to pay mr choo hourly rates of s$800 or s$1,200 per hour for his services in relation to the os 601 interpleader proceedings (the “interpleader agreement”); d. an oral agreement made in june 2001 for the defendants to pay mr choo hourly rates of s$800 or s$1,200 per hour for his services in relation to the recovery of the profits from the investments in the melbourne properties (the “melbourne profits agreement (joint)”); e. an agreement made in july 2001 for the defendants to pay mr choo a fixed fee of a$50,000 if he successfully negotiated a settlement with m/s mei leong, lam & co, which was then a law firm in hong kong (“m/s mei leong”) (the “mei leong indemnity agreement”). this settlement concerned letters of indemnity which mr phua had executed in 1999 in relation to the raising of capital for the investments in the melbourne properties; and f. an oral agreement made in or around april 2002 for m/s mei leong to pay mr choo a retainer of a$30,000 per year for his services in ensuring that its client’s claim to part of the money in the acu account was looked after (the “lee claim agreement”).    7 mr choo also claimed overseas fees and expenses under the interpleader agreement and the melbourne profits agreement (joint). 8 the defendants disputed mr choo’s characterisation of his services as business consultancy services and argued that he had, instead, provided legal services. they contended that mr choo’s provision of these legal services while he was an unauthorised person contravened the lpa. the defendants also disputed the existence of all of the alleged agreements relied on by mr choo, save for the mei leong indemnity agreement. they contended that mr choo was instead to be paid 20% of the moneys recovered from the profits of the investments in the melbourne properties (the “20% remuneration arrangement”), and that this arrangement was void for champerty. alternatively, the defendants argued that mr choo had already been paid what he was entitled to. in any event, they argued that his claims were time-barred under the limitation act.9 mr phua counterclaimed against mr choo for an account and inquiry in respect of the sale proceeds of the atech shares. alternatively, mr phua sought a sum of a$214,524 from mr choo, based on mr choo’s own position as to the sale proceeds he had received from the atech shares. separately, mr ding counterclaimed against mr choo for the repayment of loans amounting to s$24,000 which he had extended to mr choo in 2015. the court’s decision  nature of mr choo’s work 10 the court found that mr choo was engaged by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor, and did in fact act as an advocate and solicitor, while he was an unauthorised person. there was overwhelming evidence that the defendants had always viewed mr choo as their lawyer and relied primarily on his legal expertise, and had not employed him in some other non-legal capacity. mr choo himself described his work as “legal” work in his written agreements and correspondence with the defendants, his invoices, and his affidavits. he was deeply involved in preparing documents relating to legal proceedings; in particular, he had drafted the defendants’ affidavits for various court proceedings. he also advised the defendants on matters including directors’ duties, fiduciary duties, forum non conveniens, limitation periods, equitable relief, and potential criminal liability. therefore, he was barred by s 36(1) of the lpa from recovering any fees for the legal work he did for the defendants while he was an unauthorised person: at [90] to [131], [137] to [142], and [405(a)]. 11 however, the court declined to make an order under s 36(2) of the lpa for mr choo to refund the various sums of moneys already paid to him. such an order was sought only by mr phua, but mr phua had not paid mr choo any of these sums. further, the payment of mr choo’s travelling allowance did not fall within the scope of s 33 of the lpa, as was required by s 36(2): at [132] to [134], [143], and [405(a)]. basis on which mr choo was to be paid 12 first, the court found that the melbourne capital agreement did not exist. other than mr choo’s bare assertions, there was no evidence of such an agreement. further, at the time of this alleged agreement, the defendants had no dispute with mr lee regarding the recovery of their capital from the melbourne properties. in any event, even if the melbourne capital agreement had existed, mr choo’s claim for fees thereunder would have been time-barred because more than six years had elapsed between the return of mr phua’s capital from the investments in the melbourne properties and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at [160] to [177] and [405(b)].13 next, the court found that the melbourne profits agreement (phua), the interpleader agreement, and the melbourne profits agreement (joint) did not exist. mr choo claimed hourly rates of s$800 and s$1,200 per hour under these alleged agreements. however, there was no documentary evidence to support these alleged hourly rates. there were also inconsistencies between mr choo’s pleaded position and his own testimony at the trial as to when these hourly rates were agreed on, and even what these hourly rates were. the evidence also showed that the defendants would not have agreed to these exorbitant hourly rates, especially when the extent of their potential legal costs would be uncertain. furthermore, even if the interpleader agreement had existed, mr choo’s claim for fees thereunder would have been time-barred because more than six years had elapsed between mr choo’s completion of his work under the interpleader agreement and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at [192] to [220], [239] to [242], and [405(c)].14 instead, mr choo was to be paid in accordance with the 20% remuneration arrangement for all the work done for the defendants with respect to the recovery of the profits from their investments in the melbourne properties and os 601. this arrangement cohered with the documentary evidence, including the written consultancy agreement, and was also more plausible in the circumstances: at [205] to [206], [221] to [232], [243] to [244], and [405(c)].15 however, the 20% remuneration arrangement was champertous as it was based on mr choo receiving a 20% share of whatever the defendants recovered from the profits of the investments in the melbourne properties. as such, the 20% remuneration arrangement was contrary to public policy and was, therefore, void and unenforceable: at [267] to [277] and [405(d)].16 there was also no evidence that the defendants had agreed to pay mr choo his alleged overseas fees, which were inconsistent with those recorded in the written consultancy agreement. furthermore, mr choo had not produced any documentary evidence to support his claim for the expenses he had incurred on air tickets and accommodation: at [233] to [238], [245], and [405(e)].17 as for the lee claim agreement, the court found that the alleged annual retainer under this agreement did not exist, and that mr choo could not rely on the written tripartite agreement to support his claim. in any event, mr choo had not provided any cogent or consistent basis for claiming this alleged retainer from the defendants: at [246] to [263] and [405(f)].       whether mr choo had already been paid  18 it was undisputed that the mei leong indemnity agreement existed and that mr choo was entitled to a$50,000 thereunder. however, the court found that the defendants had paid mr choo the full fixed fee of a$50,000 in 2001. this was supported by the documentary and circumstantial evidence. in any event, mr choo’s claim for this fee was time-barred as more than six years had elapsed between mr choo’s completion of his work under the mei leong indemnity agreement and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at [280] to [291], [329] to [330], and [405(g)]. 19 the court found that the defendants had also paid mr choo a sum of s$200,000 in 2013, which served as full and final settlement of all fees payable by them to mr choo from the moneys in the acu account. the evidence showed that the full sum of s$200,000 was paid to mr choo by mr ding and that it was intended as a settlement of mr choo’s claim against the defendants: at [292] to [327], [331] to [333], and [405(h)]. novation20 in any event, the defendants had signed a deed of agreement of transfer of beneficial interest (the “datbi”) in january 2013, under which mr ding agreed to assume mr phua’s liability to pay mr choo’s fees for services rendered since 2000. the court found that the datbi had novated any liabilities that mr phua had to pay mr choo’s fees to mr ding, and that mr choo had impliedly consented to the novation as he had drafted the datbi. consequently, mr choo could no longer claim any unpaid fees from mr phua: at [335] to [346] and [405(i)]. mr phua’s counterclaim 21 the court found that mr choo was not entitled to sell the atech shares or retain any of the sale proceeds as payment for work done. mr choo held these shares on trust for mr phua and was only entitled to sell them without mr phua’s consent if certain conditions were satisfied. at the time mr choo sold the shares, these conditions had not been satisfied. furthermore, as the atech shares were held as security for the payment of mr choo’s legal fees, and these legal fees were paid, he had no basis to sell the atech shares. however, as mr choo had failed to produce any documentary evidence of the sale price and total sale proceeds of the atech shares despite several invitations to do so, an account and inquiry would be an exercise in futility. based on mr choo’s own position that the atech shares were sold for a total sum of a$214,524, the court ordered mr choo to pay mr phua this sum with interest: at [355] to [393] and [406]. mr ding’s counterclaim  22 the court found that mr ding had made loans amounting to s$24,000 to mr choo in 2015. mr choo’s contention that these sums were intended to be advance payments of his fees was unsupported by the evidence. consequently, the court ordered mr choo to repay these loans with interest: at [394] to [404] and [407]. this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the
