supreme court of singapore20 october 2021case summarynambu pvd pte ltd v ubts pte ltd and another appeal [2021] sgca 98civil appeals nos 2 and 16 of 2021 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the court of appeal (delivered by justice of the court of appeal andrew phang boon leong):outcome: the court of appeal dismisses cas 2 and 16/2021.pertinent and significant points of the judgment:•  non-contractual documents cannot give rise to a course of dealing from which contractual terms may be incorporated (at [55]).background to the appeals1 nambu pvd pte ltd (“nambu”) and ubts pte ltd (“ubts”) entered into a contract (“the contract”) for ubts to transport a machine (“the machine”). the vehicle from ubts which carried the machine caught fire. nambu then sued ubts for fire damage to the machine.2  the high court found, amongst other things, that the fire was due to negligence on ubts’s part. the high court held further that ubts could not rely on its own standard terms and conditions (“ubts t&cs”) or the singapore logistics association’s standard terms and conditions (“sla t&cs”) to limit its liability, since neither set of terms was incorporated into the contract. further, out of nambu’s claims totalling $1,226,807.20 on the basis of replacing the machine (alternatively, $1,279,537.20 on the basis of repairing it), the high court only awarded nambu $248,240.00, together with interest and costs of $160,000.00 (excluding disbursements).3  ca/ca 2/2021 (“ca 2”) was nambu’s appeal in respect of the quantum of damages and costs awarded to it. ca 16/2021 (“ca 16”) was ubts’ appeal in respect of the finding that the sla t&cs were not incorporated into the contract (there was no appeal, however, against the finding that the ubts t&cs were not incorporated into the contract).the court of appeal’s decision 4 in relation to ca 2, nambu’s arguments were intensely factual, and had already been considered by the high court at first instance. the court found that the high threshold for appellate intervention with findings of fact had not been satisfied, and accordingly dismissed ca 2 (at [8]–[9], [21]).5 in relation to ca 16, ubts argued that the sla t&cs were incorporated into the contract by virtue of a course of dealing, since the sla t&cs were referenced in delivery orders and invoices issued by ubts for work done prior and unrelated to the contract. the court noted that the delivery orders and invoices were not meant to have contractual effect. this was fatal to ubts’ argument, because non-contractual documents could not give rise to a course of dealing from which contractual terms may be incorporated. if the delivery orders and invoices were not binding for the very contracts for which they were issued, there was no reason for nambu to expect these delivery orders and invoices to be binding for the contract (at [55]). this summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s judgment. it is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the court. all numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the court’s judgment.
