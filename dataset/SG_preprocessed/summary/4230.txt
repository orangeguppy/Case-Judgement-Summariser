_____________________________________________________________________
decision of the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon)
coa substantially dismisses appeal brought by the controller of the erc group (andy ong) and his associate (ong han boon) against the hc’s finding that they had engaged in oppressive conduct towards sakae, a minority shareholder of a joint venture company, but allows appeal brought by another of andy ong’s associates (ho) against the hc’s finding of oppression.
pertinent and significant points of the judgment


in proceedings where some (but not all) of the defendants make a “no case to answer” submission and elect not to adduce evidence, these defendants may nonetheless rely on the evidence adduced by the other defendants who do not make the submission and who thus proceed to lead evidence: at [67]–[78].


where an act of oppression features both personal wrongs against the shareholder and corporate wrongs against the company, the court needs to consider the real injury that is complained of and the essential remedy that is sought in ascertaining whether an oppression claim brought under s 216 of the companies act (cap 50, 2006 rev ed) is an abuse of process: at [115]–[122].


a director’s breach of his duty of care, skill and diligence in monitoring the management of his company’s affairs would amount to oppression only if the negligent mismanagement is sufficiently serious: at [147]–[152].


a shareholder who complains of oppression may be precluded from seeking relief under s 216 where it has an alternative remedy that is both appropriate and adequate to bring to an end the matters complained of: at [159]–[173].


there is no requirement under s 15(1) of the civil law act (cap 43, 1999 rev ed) that the person who suffers the damage in respect of which contribution is sought must be the plaintiff in the main action: at [213]–[214].



background
1          the present matters arose out of the decisions of the high court judge (“the judge”) in two consolidated actions, suits nos 1098 and 122 of 2013 (“suit 1098” and “suit 122” respectively; and collectively, “the two suits”). in suit 1098, sakae holdings ltd (“sakae”) sought relief under s 216 of the companies act against ong siew kwee (“andy ong”), ong han boon and ho yew kong (“ho”), as well as various companies owned and controlled by andy ong (“the erc group”), alleging that they had acted in a manner oppressive to its interests as a minority shareholder in a joint venture company (“the company”) by engaging in seven transactions that had (among other things) caused a substantial amount of money to be diverted from the company to companies in the erc group. in suit 122, sakae sued andy ong for, among other things, breach of the fiduciary duties that he owed as a director of sakae; this suit concerned only one of the seven impugned transactions (“transaction 6”). nine of the defendants commenced third party proceedings in the two suits against douglas foo peow yong (“foo”), the chairman of sakae’s board, seeking indemnification or contribution in respect of any liability that they might incur arising from sakae’s claims. 
the material facts
2          sakae, the company and gryphon real estate investment corporation pte ltd (“greic”), whose shareholders at the material time included andy ong, ong han boon and ho, entered into a joint venture agreement (“jva”) in september 2010, under which the company was intended to be the vehicle through which the parties would invest in units at bugis cube, redevelop those units and sell them at a profit. sakae was the minority shareholder in the company, while greic was the majority shareholder.
3          sakae and foo left the management of the company to andy ong and gryphon capital management pte ltd, a company controlled by andy ong which was established to manage the company’s real estate investment. over the years, andy ong masterminded the diversion of the company’s assets to companies in the erc group by way of seven transactions. foo uncovered these wrongful transactions in october 2012, leading sakae to commence the two suits. 
4          in the judgment issued by the judge dealing with sakae’s claims in the two suits (“the main judgment”), the judge allowed most of sakae’s claims, finding that six of the seven impugned transactions were oppressive to sakae and that andy ong had breached the fiduciary duties which he owed as a director of sakae. the judge also ordered the company to be wound up. in a separate judgment dealing with the third party claims against foo (“the third party judgment”), the judge dismissed these claims and ordered indemnity costs against andy ong, ong han boon and ho.
5          in respect of the main judgment, ho brought the appeal in civil appeal no 86 of 2017 (“ca 86”), while andy ong, ong han boon and five other defendants in suit 1098 brought the appeal in civil appeal no 87 of 2017 (“ca 87”) (collectively, “the main appeals”). in respect of the third party judgment, andy ong and ong han boon brought the appeal in civil appeal no 103 of 2017 (“ca 103”), while ho brought the appeal in civil appeal no 104 of 2017 (“ca 104”) (collectively, “the third party appeals”). andy ong also filed court of appeal originating summons no 13 of 2017 (“os 13”), seeking a retroactive extension of time to file an appeal against the findings made by the judge in both judgments in respect of suit 122, having filed notices of appeal only against the judge’s findings in respect of suit 1098.
the court’s decision
6          no order was made for os 13. in relation to the main appeals, ca 86 was allowed, while ca 87 was allowed in part in respect of transaction 6. as for the third party appeals, ca 103 was dismissed in respect of the third party claims under suit 1098, while no order was made in respect of the third party claim under suit 122. no order was made for ca 104, save that the judge’s order of indemnity costs against ho was set aside: at [53], [236].
7          where an act of oppression features both personal wrongs against the shareholder and corporate wrongs against the company, the court should have regard to the real injury that is complained of and the essential remedy that is sought in ascertaining whether an oppression claim brought under s 216 of the companies act is an abuse of process. the analytical framework to be applied is as follows:
            a          injury
                         i        what is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?
                          ii       is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?          
           b       remedy
                    i         what is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?
                   ii          is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?
on the facts, the real injury which sakae sought to vindicate was the injury to its investment in the joint venture and the breach of its legitimate expectations as to how the affairs of the company would be managed, and the essential remedy which sakae sought was to exit the joint venture. hence, sakae’s oppression claims pertained to personal wrongs committed against it and were properly pursued by way of an action under s 216: at [115]–[122], [124]–[129].
8          ca 87 was allowed in part. andy ong and ong han boon were rightly found by the judge to be liable for oppression given their deliberate involvement in the impugned transactions with full knowledge of the true effect of the transactions. however, in respect of transaction 6 (the sole transaction in issue in suit 122), the judge’s order for andy ong to pay sakae the sum of $2,641,975 and interest thereon was set aside. instead, sakae’s subscription for an additional 2,641,975 shares in the company pursuant to transaction 6 was invalidated and the company was ordered to repay sakae the sum of $2,641,975. the subscription for shares in the company by erc holdings pte ltd (the ultimate holding company of the companies in the erc group) pursuant to transaction 6 was also invalidated, and the sum paid by it for the shares was to be held by the company in escrow pending any orders as to the disbursement of the sum: at [131], [195]–[201].
9          ca 86 was allowed. sakae’s oppression claims against ho were not made out. although a director of a company is a fiduciary, not all the duties which he owes his company are fiduciary in nature. there is a distinction between fiduciary duties, which are rooted in a director’s duty of loyalty and honesty to his company, and the duty of care, skill and diligence. the evidence only supported a finding that ho acted in breach of his duty of care, skill and diligence to the company. but sakae failed to plead this, and instead only pleaded that ho acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to the company. in any event, a director’s breach of his duty of care, skill and diligence in monitoring the management of his company’s affairs would amount to oppression only if the negligent mismanagement was sufficiently serious. on the facts, ho’s conduct did not cross this threshold: at [132], [134]–[135], [145], [147]–[152].
10        ca 103 was dismissed. the requirements for the recovery of contribution under s 15(1) of the civil law act were not satisfied as andy ong and ong han boon had failed to prove their pleaded case that foo acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to the company. in any event, foo should be exempted under s 16(2) from any liability to make contribution to andy ong and ong han boon because otherwise, andy ong would be unjustly enriched by being able to retain the fruits of his unlawful actions to the extent of any contribution that he recovered from foo, while ong han boon would in effect be permitted to rely on his own illegality to avoid bearing the full brunt of his liability for his wrongdoing: at [209], [222], [232], [233]. 
11        in the light of ca 86 being allowed, no order was made for ca 104, save that the judge’s order of indemnity costs against ho was set aside: at [204].
