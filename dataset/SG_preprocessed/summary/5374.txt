decision

of the court of appeal (delivered by chao hick tin ja)
background to the appeal 
1                   

the appellant was convicted by

a high court judge (“judge”) of two charges under the penal code (cap 224, 2008

rev ed), one for rape under s 375(1)(a)

and one for sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) for having penetrated the victim’s vagina with his finger. the

trial judge sentenced him to 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane

for each charge. the imprisonment terms were reduced to 11 years and 19 days

for each offence to

take into account the time that the appellant had spent in remand before being

released on bail. with both sentences ordered to run concurrently, the

appellant’s aggregate sentence was 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and 12

strokes of the cane. the appellant filed an appeal challenging both his

conviction and the sentences imposed on him. 
facts
2                   

the

material events occurred over a short span of about four hours, between 11pm on

5 may 2012 and 2:50am on 6 may 2012. the victim, [v], was 20 years of age at that

time and was employed as a contract teacher. she went with a friend, [s], to a

party at the wavehouse, a club at siloso beach, sentosa. the party was to

promote cointreau, a brand of orange-flavoured liqueur. 
3                   

at

the bar counter of the wavehouse, [v] and [s] met the appellant, a part-time

beach patrol officer who had attended the party after finishing his shift. there

was plenty of drinking. on one occasion, [v] had cointreau poured into her

mouth for some 20 seconds straight by the appellant because it had come to

light that she had turned 20 the week before. also at the bar counter was [j], a

part-time event promoter who was working at the party at the wavehouse that

night and who had been asked to attend to [v] and [s].  
4                   

at

one point in time, [v] left the bar counter for the vip area in the wavehouse

because [j] had asked her to go there with him. she then went back to the bar counter

area to rejoin [s] and the appellant. later, [v] danced on the dance floor with

[j]. at some point, while she was dancing, [v] realised she was too drunk and

wanted to go home. she recalled trying to look for [s]. 
5                   

[s]

said that she called [v] and [v] told her that she was in the vip area. [s]

went with the appellant to the vip area. the appellant found [v]. [s] then met

up with both of them at the intersection between the bar and the vip area. [s]

said that the appellant then asked her to get [v]’s bag from the vip area. when

she returned, the appellant and [v] were no longer there. [v] and the appellant

had left the club by themselves and headed for the beach. 
6                   

what

happened after that was the central dispute in this case. [v] said that by this

time, she was intoxicated to the point of being barely conscious, and that the

appellant had penetrated her with his finger and also raped her while they were

on the beach. the appellant asserted that [v] was not as intoxicated as she

claims to have been, and that the sexual activity between them, which included

some foreplay, was consensual.
7                   

on realising [v] had gone missing, [s] spent about 20 minutes looking for

her. she called [v] on her handphone a few times. one time, the appellant

answered and told her that he and [v] were on the beach; he told [s] to remain

at the wavehouse and that he would look for her. [s] went to look for [v] on

the beach nonetheless. [s] found the appellant and [v] on the beach. [s] tried

talking to [v] but the latter was not responding clearly. she saw [v] foaming

at the mouth and, in a state of panic, she called the singapore civil defence

force to request an ambulance. that was at 2:50am. 
8                   

two

partygoers named kason and terence, who were friends and had gone to the

wavehouse that night, roughly saw what happened between the appellant and [v]

on the beach. at about 2am, kason was walking along the beach looking for a

friend’s lost slippers. he saw the appellant, his bare buttocks facing him,

kneeling down and bending over [v]. kason thought the appellant and [v] were a

couple making out and ignored them. kason passed them a second time when he

passed by the same location later. he saw the appellant kneeling in between

[v]’s legs. kason met up with terence and told him what he had seen. terence

went to have a look for himself. he saw that there was little movement from

[v]. terence told kason that what he had seen was not right. kason went back

for a third look and saw that [v] was naked and trying to push the appellant

away with the use of one hand. kason called the police at 2:25am. 
9                   

following

kason’s police report, officers from the singapore police force arrived at the

scene at 2:53am. the appellant was placed under arrest at 6:20am on 6 may 2012.


court’s decision 
the appeal against conviction
10               

for

the offence of rape under s 375 of the penal code, the public prosecutor (“pp”)

bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the appellant had

penetrated the vagina of [v] with his penis; and (b) this was without her

consent. the judge found that the pp had proven both these elements of the

offence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
11               

the appellant made three

arguments on appeal. first, although the appellant did not challenge the judge’s finding that

he had penetrated [v]’s vagina with both his penis and his finger, he argued

that the judge’s finding that [v] did not consent was inconsistent with the

material evidence on record.
12               

the

court of appeal rejected this argument. the evidence relied on by the appellant

did not assist him. the evidence relating to the interaction between the

appellant and [v] at the bar counter was only remotely relevant to determining

whether [v] had decided to engage in consensual sexual activity on the beach

with the appellant in spite of her being fairly intoxicated ([72]). the fact that there was no

evidence of what happened between 1am and 2am apart from the appellant’s and

[v]’s account of events did not mean that [v] and the appellant must have been

engaging in consensual foreplay. this was but a speculation which became less

tenable once one factored in [v]’s level of intoxication ([79]). the medical evidence showing an absence of a fresh tear on

[v]’s vagina was a neutral factor given that [v] was intoxicated to the point

where she was verging on unconsciousness and could not put up any resistance ([89]). 
13               

the appellant’s second argument

related to the judge’s finding that even if the appellant had asked [v] whether

she wanted to have sex, and even if [v] had said yes, her response would have

been vitiated by s 90(b) of the penal

code. section 90(b) says that consent

given by a person who, from intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of

that to which he gives his consent, is not valid consent. the appellant argued

the judge was wrong to have found that [v] was incapable of giving consent due

to her intoxication. 
14               

the

court rejected this argument. the evidence as to [v]’s mental state immediately

before, during and immediately after the time she was with the appellant at the

beach suggested that she was in no capacity to consent to penile or digital

penetration. she was too intoxicated to understand the nature and consequences

of giving consent. she could not have consented to either act of penetration by

the appellant ([108]). 
15               

the

appellant’s third argument related to the judge’s rejection of the appellant’s

reliance on the defence of mistake of fact in s 79 of the penal code. section

79 says that nothing is an offence if done by a person who, by reason of a

mistake of fact, in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in doing

it. according to s 52 of the penal code, nothing is believed “in good faith” if

it is believed “without due care and attention” [110]. 
16               

the

court was not persuaded that, even if the appellant believed, mistakenly, that

[v] was consenting to penile and digital penetration, he had arrived at this

belief after having exercised due care and attention ([114]). 
17               

in

the circumstances, the court affirmed the judge’s conviction of the appellant

on both charges ([116]). 
the appeal against sentence
18               

the judge made his decision on

sentence based on the sentencing framework propounded in public prosecutor v nf [2006] 4 slr(r) 849. that framework was revised in a recent decision of

the court, ng kean meng terence v public prosecutor [2017] 2 slr 449 (“terence ng”), which was issued on 12 may

2017, after the court had heard this appeal (on 11 april 2017). accordingly, in

anticipation that the revised framework in terence

ng could be relevant if the court were to affirm the conviction recorded by

the judge against the appellant, the court invited parties to make specific

submissions on how the new framework would impact the sentences in this case ([118]). the parties did so on 27 june

2017. 
19               

terence ng set out three sentencing bands for

rape ([121]). rape falls within band

1 if there are no offence-specific aggravating factors or if they are present

only to a very limited extent; it falls within band 2 if there are two or more

offence-specific aggravating factors ([122]).

the appellant argued that the present case fell within band 1 because there was

no offence-specific aggravating factor ([123]).

the pp argued that the present case fell within band 2 because there were two

offence-specific aggravating factors, namely the vulnerability of [v] due to

her intoxication and the fact that the appellant had acted with premeditation

([124]). 
20               

the court found that there was

only one offence-specific aggravating factor here: the vulnerability of the

victim. [v] was

severely intoxicated and had no control over even basic motor movements. she

was a vulnerable victim and the appellant exploited that to his advantage ([132]). however, the court did not think

the appellant’s acts were premeditated; rather, his moves were hatched on the

spur of the moment ([138]). since

the presence of one offence-specific aggravating factor would place a case

within the middle to upper range of band 1 ([139]), the indicative sentence here would be 12 or 13 years’

imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. given that range, the judge’s sentence

of 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the rape charge was not

manifestly excessive ([140]). 
21               

as for the offence of sexual

assault by digital penetration, the court disagreed with the pp’s submission

that the same sentencing bands for rape as set out in terence ng should apply. among other reasons, this was because, in

the court’s view, there is an intelligible difference between penile

penetration of the vagina and digital penetration of it. first, penile penetration carries the risk

of unwanted pregnancy and of transmitting sexual diseases which would have

far-reaching consequences for the victim. second, penile penetration is a more

intimate act than digital penetration; the abuse of such an act therefore

represents a greater degree of intrusion into the sexual autonomy of the victim

and a greater degree of exploitation by the offender of the victim ([150]). 
22               

nonetheless,

the court recognised the logic of the pp’s submission that the terence ng framework should be

transposed to the offence of digital penetration, because many of the

offence-specific aggravating factors for rape may also be present and pertinent

in offences involving digital penetration ([158]). however, the range of starting sentence for each band should

be lower to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence ([159]). the court therefore held that the sentencing bands should be

as follows: 
(a)               

band

1: 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane; 
(b)              

band

2: 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane; 
(c)               

band

3: 15 to  20 years’ imprisonment and 12

strokes of the cane.
23               applying

these sentencing bands to the present appeal, the court found that the

appellant’s sentence for the digital penetration charge was too high and should

be reduced. the indicative starting sentence was also in the middle to upper

range of band 1 given the presence of the one offence-specific aggravating

factor, which is that the appellant exploited the vulnerability of [v], who was

intoxicated. that gave an indicative sentence of either 8 to 9 years’

imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane ([172]).

the court found that an appropriate sentence would be 8 years and six months’ imprisonment

and 4 strokes of the cane. after taking into account the period of remand, the

sentence was reduced to 7 years six months and 19 days’ imprisonment and 4

strokes of the cane ([173]).
24               

in

the premises, the appeal against conviction was dismissed ([174]) and the appeal against sentence was

allowed only in respect of the sentence for the digital penetration offence. the result, therefore, was that the total imprisonment term remained

at 11 years and 19 days and the total number of strokes of caning was reduced

from 12 to 10 ([175]).
