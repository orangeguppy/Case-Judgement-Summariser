------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of

the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh menon): 
 
outcome: coa dismissed both of the appellant’s appeals

against two separate high court decisions. in the first, the coa upheld the

high court’s dismissal of the appellant’s re-sentencing application. in the

second, the coa upheld the high court’s dismissal of the appellant’s

application seeking leave to commence judicial review proceedings of the public

prosecutor’s decision not to issue a certificate of substantive assistance in

his favour. 
 
introduction 
 
1          these were

two appeals by the appellant, who had been convicted and sentenced to death for

drug importation, against two separate decisions of the high court. 
 
background to the appeals 
 
2          the appellant

had been apprehended in 2009, as he was entering singapore from malaysia, with

a bundle of diamorphine strapped to his thigh. when questioned by officers from

the central narcotics bureau (“cnb”), the appellant admitted to knowing that

the bundle contained diamorphine, and explained at the time that a friend known

only as “king” had strapped the bundle to his thigh so that no one would find

it. the appellant’s contemporaneous statements were duly recorded by the cnb

officers. 
 
3           at trial

however, the appellant denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle

and raised, for the first time, the defence that he had been threatened to

deliver the bundle of drugs for king. the trial judge rejected these defences,

finding that the appellant’s contemporaneous statements were voluntarily

provided and accurately recorded. the trial judge accordingly convicted the

appellant and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty at the time. 
 
4          after the

appellant’s conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal, the execution of the

appellant’s sentence was stayed in view of the fact that parliament was

undertaking a review of the mandatory death penalty in relation to drug

offences at the material time. the appellant then applied to be re-sentenced

under the new sentencing regime introduced by parliament, seeking to show,

towards that end, that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that

substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts at the time of

his offending conduct. he provided conflicting accounts of the reasons for his

offending however, in the various psychological and psychiatric reports

tendered for the purposes of the re-sentencing application. the high court

judge (“the judge”) accordingly found that the most credible account of why he

offended was that which was contained in the contemporaneous statements he had

provided to the cnb officers at the time of his arrest in 2009. the appellant

had stated in those statements that he knew the bundle he was delivering

contained drugs, but that he was doing so because he needed money. on that

basis, the judge found that the appellant clearly understood the nature of what

he was doing and his judgment as to what was right or wrong was not impaired.

the judge therefore dismissed the appellant’s application to be re-sentenced,

finding that the appellant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind that

substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his offence. in the first

appeal, the appellant appeals against the judge’s decision to dismiss his

re-sentencing application. 
 
5          separately,

the public prosecutor (“pp”) had informed the appellant that he would not be

issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33b(2)(b) of the

misuse of drugs act (cap 185, 2008 rev ed) (“mda”) in the appellant’s favour.

the appellant sought leave from the high court to commence judicial review

proceedings against the pp’s non-certification decision. in the second appeal,

the appellant appeals against the judge’s dismissal of his leave application. 
 
the court’s decision 
 
6          in the first

appeal, the court began by observing that the judge was particularly troubled

by the fact that the appellant had, at various points in time, provided vastly

different and irreconcilable accounts of why he had committed the offence (at [35]).

the court took the view that the appellant’s vacillation between various

accounts of why he had offended did not aid his case at all, and that they all

contradicted the original account of the reason for his offending – that which

was provided in his contemporaneous statements to the cnb officers (at [37]).

there was no reason to doubt the veracity of that account, as the statements

were found to have been accurately recorded and given voluntarily (at [38]).

on that account, the appellant’s mental responsibility for his offence could

not have been substantially impaired, because he clearly understood the nature

of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or

wrongness of what he was doing. he was unequivocal in identifying the contents

of the bundle as diamorphine and took steps to conceal the bundle, as he knew

that it was unlawful for him to transport drugs. yet, he undertook the criminal

endeavour for money (at [40]). in the court’s judgment, the appellant

took a calculated risk which, contrary to his expectations, materialised. in

the circumstances, even if his ability to assess the risk was impaired, on no

basis could this amount to an impairment of his mental responsibility for his

acts (at [41]). the court, accordingly, dismissed the first appeal (at [42]).


 
7          in the second

appeal, the court began by considering the preliminary issue of whether s

33b(4) of the mda had the effect of ousting the court’s power to review the

pp’s non-certification decision. the court began with the observation that in a

constitutional system of governance such as singapore’s, the courts are

ordinarily vested with the power to adjudicate upon all disputes; judicial

review forms a part of this power to adjudicate and concerns that area of law

where the courts review the legality of government actions (at [46]).

the court found that s 33b(4) was not an ouster clause, as it did not purport

to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts to supervise the legality of the pp’s

non-certification decision; it only immunised the pp from suit save on certain

exceptions as stated in s 33b(4) (at [51]). the court noted that the

inquiry whether an offender had substantively assisted the cnb in disrupting

drug trafficking activities within or outside singapore entailed a wide ranging

assessment going beyond the institutional competence of the courts, which was

ultimately directed to the resolution of particular controversies (at [58]).

in that light, it was entirely logical for parliament to vest in the pp the

responsibility for determining whether an offender had rendered substantive

assistance to the cnb in disrupting drug trafficking activities and then to

immunise the pp, save on excepted grounds, in respect of that determination.

without s 33b(4), an aggrieved offender might be tempted to bring suit against

the pp challenging his determination, and thereby force the court into the

unviable position of having to determine an issue that the court is inherently

not capable of determining; yet, at the same time, the exceptions to the

immunity granted by s 33b(4) serve to safeguard against abuse (at [67]).


 
8          having found

that s 33b(4) did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to review the pp’s

non-certification decision, the court proceeded to determine the merits of the

appeal. the court dismissed the second appeal on both grounds of review brought

by the appellant. as to the first ground, the court was of the view that the

appellant had not adduced a shred of evidence to show that the pp had failed to

consider the effect of the appellant’s information provided in his

contemporaneous statements on the disruption of drug trafficking activities at

that time (at [79]). as to the second ground, the court took the view

that the pp’s determination of whether an offender had rendered substantive

assistance to the cnb in disrupting drug trafficking activities both within and

outside singapore was simply not a determination involving the exercise of an

executive discretion that required a precedent fact to be established (at [84]),

which meant that the appellant could not impugn the pp’s non-certification

decision on the ground that the decision was reached in the absence of a

precedent fact being established.
