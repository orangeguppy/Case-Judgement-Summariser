supreme court of singapore3 november 2022case summarysingapore airlines ltd v csds aircraft sales & leasing inc [2022] sghc(i) 15singapore international commercial court — suit no 4 of 2019 (assessment of damages 1 of 2022)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the singapore international commercial court (delivered by jeremy lionel cooke ij):outcome: sicc assessed the damages for breach of an aircraft purchase agreement to be us$4.76m + s$233,829.87. background 1 singapore airlines ltd (“sia”) and csds aircraft sales & leasing inc (“csds”) entered into an aircraft purchase agreement dated 19 september 2018 (“the aircraft purchase agreement”). under the aircraft purchase agreement, sia agreed to sell a boeing 777-212 aircraft (the “aircraft”) without engines for us$6.5m to csds. csds paid the deposit of us$250,000 but failed to pay the balance of us$6.25m.2 in singapore airlines ltd v csds aircraft sales & leasing inc [2021] 5 slr 26, csds was found by the singapore international commercial court to be in repudiatory breach of the aircraft purchase agreement on 26 october 2018 and this breach was accepted by sia as bringing the aircraft purchase agreement to an end on 4 november 2018. this decision was upheld by the court of appeal in csds aircraft sales & leasing inc v singapore airlines ltd [2022] 1 slr 284.3 following the above decisions on liability, the court had to assess the damages resulting from the breach of contract by csds. sia claimed the following heads of damages:a. the difference in the contract price and the market price of the aircraft, under s 50(3) of the english sale of goods act 1979 (c 54) (uk) (the “act”) which would allow for reasonable time for negotiation and conclusion of the sale following acceptance of the repudiation;b. parking and maintenance fees from 4 november 2018 until the expiry of that reasonable time; andc. marketing, brokerage and legal costs associated with any such sale.4 sia submitted that the reasonable period in question was nine to twelve months.5 csds submitted that the only relevant date for assessment of damages was the date of termination of the aircraft purchase agreement, namely 4 november 2018 and that, at that stage, the actual value of the aircraft exceeded the contract value. alternatively, if sia was right in saying that the market value should be calculated at a date following a reasonable period in which a substitute sale could be achieved, that period was less than three months. csds also submitted that the parking charges, the maintenance charges, the marketing, brokerage and legal costs were all irrecoverable or alternatively, if recoverable, were unjustified and manifestly excessive.the evidence adduced by the parties6 sia adduced evidence of fact from its senior manager responsible for aircraft sales, mr cheong khin cheong (“mr cheong”). mr cheong gave evidence of the events that took place after the breach of the aircraft purchase agreement, including the steps taken by sia to obtain a substitute sale of the aircraft. sia also adduced expert evidence from mr philip seymour (“mr seymour”), a well-known certified aircraft appraiser with the international society of transport aircraft trading. mr seymour gave evidence on, among other things, the range of costs that would ordinarily be incurred in a substitute sale, the ordinary approach to selling aircraft, the process followed by sia, and the period of time required to ensure that sufficient potential buyers were found and to conclude a contract.7 csds served evidence from mr sriyantha benedict sirimanne (“mr sirimanne”), its president, in the form of an affidavit of evidence-in-chief. however, the court was informed during the hearing that mr sirimanne would not be tendered for cross-examination and accepted that, in those circumstances, no reliance could be placed on his evidence which had been used in part as the basis to cross-examine mr seymour.decision of the courton the market value of the aircraft and the reasonable period to obtain a substitute sale8 the court rejected any suggestion that inadequate efforts were made to sell the aircraft or to explore all options available to maximise its value to sia: at [17].9 having considered the evidence of mr cheong on the various efforts made by sia to obtain a substitute sale, the offers received by sia, and the possible alternative uses of the aircraft, the court found that a substitute sale could have resulted only based on the bid received of us$1.315m in march 2019: at [27].10 having considered the evidence of mr seymour on the state of the market, the court was satisfied that the market was weak although not noticeably softening in the period after november 2018. however, it cannot be shown that a sale at that time would necessarily take nine to twelve months: at [47].11 the court also noted that what is key in any sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer is not just the state of the market but the condition and circumstance of the individual item for sale. in the circumstances, the court found that a substitute sale of the aircraft could have been concluded within six months from 4 november 2018 in the sum of us$1.315m: at [48] and [49].12 the court found that the maximum price which could have been obtained at any stage before 4 may 2019 (six months after 4 november 2018) was us$1.5m, representing an uplift from the bid of us$1.315m which was made in march 2019. the damages suffered, taking account of the differential between the contract and market value, is us$4.75m, being the contract price of us$6.5m less the us$250,000 deposit paid, less us$1.5m: at [53].on parking and maintenance charges13 parking and maintenance charges, if reasonably incurred as costs involved in making a substitute sale were recoverable, and it was clear that both sets of charges would have to be incurred if a sale was to go ahead. as the court found that the aircraft would have been sold within six months, by 4 may 2019, the recoverable parking charges cannot extend beyond that date. the aircraft would also have to be kept somewhere available for inspection by buyers and would have to be maintained in a presentable condition for inspection by a potential buyer and kept in some sort of working order, since otherwise it would deteriorate and thus further diminish the prospects of any sale: at [54].14 the court found that the parking charges were not excessive and concluded that the sum of s$189,912.00 was a reasonable expense of the sale and was to be taken into account when assessing the damages suffered by sia: at [55].15 the court found that the maintenance charges cannot be challenged and the sum of s$43,917.87 should therefore also be taken into account in assessing the damages suffered by sia: at [56].on marketing, brokerage and legal fees16 as the evidence was that sia would ordinarily not incur marketing or brokerage fees in the context of a sale, the sum claimed of us$100,000 was not recoverable: at [57].17 the court accepted that legal costs in the sum of us$10,000 was recoverable: at [57].conclusion18 taking into account: (a) the deposit paid; (b) the price obtainable at 4 may 2019; (c) the costs incurred in realising the sale of the aircraft; and (d) the legal costs, the total damages amounted to us$4.76m + s$233,829.87: at [58] and [59].this summary is provided to assist
