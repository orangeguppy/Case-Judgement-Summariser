background




1 the appellants, mr lee shing chan (“lee”) and mr tan ah lai (“tan”), were

unlicensed fruit hawkers. on 6 june 2016 at about 6.45pm, they along with

one mr chow yong heng (“chow”) were spotted selling fruits illegally near

yew tee mrt station by two national environment agency (“nea”) officers

(“shammir” and “siow”). tan was issued a summons for being an unlicensed

hawker, and the fruits and two wooden planks that formed part of a

makeshift display table were seized. after issuing the summons, the nea

team – comprising shammir, siow, their driver and a cisco auxiliary police

officer (“apo”) – left in a van (“the nea van”).




2 the appellants and chow followed the nea van in their lorry (“the lorry”)

to various destinations over the span of about three hours from around 7pm

to 10pm. this included following the nea van back to the nea office (where

the nea team unloaded the seized items during their shift), and

subsequently after the nea van departed from the nea office. along the way,

there was also an incident at a carpark (“the seah im carpark”) where both

vehicles were parked for the time being. siow had alighted from the nea van

to take photographs of the lorry. lee, tan and chow then alighted from the

lorry and lee demanded to see siow’s warrant card. when siow refused to

produce his warrant card, lee and tan hurled vulgarities in the hokkien

dialect at siow. the driver and the apo alighted from the nea van and when

they and siow tried to get back into the nea van, lee stood in front of it

and held onto its doors. chow did not take part in this confrontation.




3 arising from the above, lee and tan were each charged with one count of

using abusive words towards a public servant in relation to the execution

of his duty as such public servant, an offence under s 6 of the poha. they

were also each charged with one count of unlawful stalking with the common

intention to cause alarm, an offence under s 7 of the poha read with s 34

of the penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed).




4 chow had pleaded guilty to the s 7 charge against him (he was not charged

under s 6 as he did not take part in the confrontation at the seah im

carpark) in earlier proceedings and was sentenced to undergo three months’

imprisonment. at the time of the hearing before the court, chow had already

served his sentence.



the decision at first instance




5 lee pleaded guilty to the s 6 charge and claimed trial in respect of the

s 7 charge. tan claimed trial for both his charges. the appellants were

tried jointly and conducted their own defences.




6 in the state courts, the magistrate (“the magistrate”) convicted the

appellants on all the charges against them. lee was sentenced to one week’s

imprisonment for the s 6 charge and four months’ imprisonment for the s 7

charge. tan was sentenced to nine days’ imprisonment and four months’

imprisonment for the corresponding charges. the magistrate ordered the

sentences for each appellant to run consecutively. lee and tan appealed

against their convictions and sentences in respect of the s 7 charges.



issues on appeal




7 the issues on appeal were: (a) whether the elements of unlawful stalking

were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, in particular, whether there was a

“course of conduct” although the appellants followed the nea van on only

one occasion; and (b) whether the sentences should stand in the light of

what this court determined to be the applicable sentencing framework.



the court’s decision on the appeals against conviction




8 on the question of when conduct on a single occasion is “protracted” so

as to qualify as a “course of conduct” under s 7(2) of the poha, the court

held that this was a fact-sensitive assessment that had to be made as a

matter of common sense. the court had to look at all the circumstances,

including the type, intensity and intrusiveness of the conduct. to be

protracted, conduct did not have to be continuous or uninterrupted. it was

invariably a matter of degree as to when seemingly innocuous behaviour

turned into a course of conduct of acts or omissions associated with

stalking. generally, if the conduct on a single occasion was engaged in for

longer than would reasonably be considered sensible in the circumstances,

that would be a pointer towards it fulfilling the meaning of protracted

conduct under s 7(10) of the poha. the assessment of whether conduct was

“protracted” under s 7(10)(a)(i) was essentially a qualitative

rather than a purely quantitative exercise. the court had to be satisfied

that there was a certain degree of persistence or continuity of purpose

which was unreasonable in the particular circumstances. to avoid

artificiality, too much emphasis ought not to be placed on whether conduct

was better classified as happening on one or multiple occasions (at    [21], [22], and [23]).




9 in the present appeals, the appellants’ conduct was protracted because

they had followed the nea van to numerous destinations over a three-hour

period. they persisted in doing so even after the nea van returned to the

nea office during their shift and the seized goods had been unloaded. the

other elements under s 7 of the poha were also established. the appellants

did not deny having followed the nea van. their other contentions were

essentially an appeal against the magistrate’s findings of fact, and the

court was not satisfied that the magistrate erred in her detailed

assessment of the evidence (at [24], [25] and    [26]).




10 the court also held that the fact that the alleged victims of unlawful

stalking were law enforcement officers, whether on duty or off duty, did

not prevent a conviction under s 7 of the poha if all the elements of the

offence specified in s 7(2) were established (at [29]).




11 accordingly, the court found that the s 7 poha charges against lee and

tan had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and dismissed their appeals

against conviction (at [30]).



the court’s decision on the appeals against sentence



12 on the issue of the appropriate sentencing framework, the court held

that merely analogising from precedents was unsatisfactory as the lack of

structure and guidance was not conducive to building consistency across

cases. on the other hand, the mathematical approach of a points system in    lim teck kim v public prosecutor [2019] 5 slr 279 should not be

adopted as it constrained the sentencing judge unduly and raised the

spectre of appeals on the allocation of points. a more holistic approach

based on the five-step methodology in    logachev vladislav v public prosecutor [2018] 4 slr 609 was

appropriate. therefore, in each case the court should (at    [34] and [35]):




(a) identify the level of harm caused by the offence (slight, moderate or

severe) and level of culpability (low, medium or high), having regard to

the offence-specific factors.




(b) identify the applicable indicative sentencing range by reference to the

following matrix.








harm


culpability 




slight




moderate




severe






low





            fine / short custodial sentence of up to 2 months

            




            2+ to 4 months’ imprisonment

            




            4+ to 6 months’ imprisonment

            





medium





            2+ to 4 months’ imprisonment

            




            4+ to 6 months’ imprisonment

            




            6+ to 9 months’ imprisonment

            





high





            4+ to 6 months’ imprisonment

            




            6+ to 9 months’ imprisonment

            




            9+ to 12 months’ imprisonment

            







(c) identify the appropriate starting point within that range, having

regard again to the offence-specific factors.




(d) adjust the starting point based on offender-specific aggravating and

mitigating factors.




(e) where an offender has been convicted of multiple charges, consider

whether further adjustments are necessary to take into account the totality

principle.




13 the court held that the fact that the victim was a public servant or

public transport worker (including a law enforcement officer) was an

offence-specific aggravating factor. however, this would only be the case

if the offender knew that the victim was a public servant or public service

worker who was in the course of discharging his or her duty or the unlawful

stalking was precipitated by what the victim said or did while in the

course of discharging his or her duty. the court disagreed that the default

starting point should be a short custodial sentence whenever this

aggravating factor was present (at [39]).




14 applying this framework, the present case occasioned slight harm and low

(or perhaps the low end of medium) culpability. the appropriate starting

point was an imprisonment term. the custodial threshold was crossed having

regard to the specific aggravating factor that the appellants knew that the

victims were public officers going about their duties that night and were

apparently undeterred by the presence of the apo. the court also noted that

there was a lack of remorse on the appellants’ part. in all the

circumstances, a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each appellant

would be appropriate. as the s 6 charges (which were not the subject of any

appeal) took place as an offshoot of the s 7 charges and were essentially

part of the train of events that night, the imprisonment terms for both

offences ought to run concurrently. the result was that lee and tan would

each serve an aggregate sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment which the court

considered was a just punishment on the facts of this case (at [    42]).
