another [2021] sgca 92civil appeal no 208 of 2020--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------decision of the court of appeal (delivered by quentin loh jad):outcome: court of appeal dismisses doctor’s appeal against liability for negligence, and allows in part the doctor’s appeal on the quantum of damages awarded.pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  the doctor breached his duty of care to his deceased patient when he did not recognise the symptoms of fat embolism and failed to call for an ambulance immediately or very soon after the onset of the deceased’s symptoms. this breach caused the patient’s death: at [36] and [39].•  mortgage instalment payments should not be awarded for a dependency claim because mortgage payments represent the use of the deceased’s income to acquire an asset – the property – which the dependant would own at the end of the day. there would thus be an element of double counting, as the dependant would get not only the use of the money but also the value of the money: at [48] and [50].•  property-related expenses (including condominium maintenance fees, property insurance, and property tax) were claimable, as these are indeed benefits which the dependant would have received from the deceased, if not for her demise: at [49].•  the multiplicand for a loss of inheritance claim for a deceased’s projected income should be calculated based on the loss of the deceased’s post-tax, rather than pre-tax, income: at [57] to [59].background to the appeal1 the appellant (“dr foo”) was a general and vascular surgeon in private practice. dr foo carried out liposuction and fat transfer surgical procedure (“the surgical procedures”) on 28 june 2013 from 12.00pm to 2.00pm on ms mandy yeong (“the deceased”) at tcs aesthetics central clinic (“the clinic”), located at the central, eu tong sen street. 2 the deceased’s oxygen saturation level was 96% at 2.00pm. very shortly after the surgical procedures were completed, the deceased was in difficulty, variously described as coughing and making a gurgling sound and experiencing a shortness of breath. at 2.05pm, the deceased’s oxygen saturation level plunged to 72% (from 96% at 2.00pm when the surgical procedures ended). the deceased suffered a collapse in the cardiovascular sense at 2.45pm. 3 dr foo only called for the ambulance at 2.53pm. the ambulance arrived at the clinic in just four minutes and its crew were attending to the deceased by 3.10pm. the deceased was conveyed to the accident and emergency department at singapore general hospital (“sgh”); the ambulance arrived there at 3.23pm. the deceased passed away at about 5.46pm.4 the deceased’s cause of death was pulmonary fat embolism, a condition where fat globules had entered a patient’s blood vessels and obstruct or block the continuous blood flow within the blood vessels and/or cause inflammation of the blood vessels. the net result would be an interruption to the blood bringing oxygen to the lungs, thereby causing oxygen starvation to the body. there were two forms of fat embolism syndrome (“fes”): a less serious form, known as non-fulminant fes, and a far more serious form known as fulminant fes (“ffes”), which presents as acute cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and/or embolic phenomena leading to death within a few hours of injury. the deceased died from the latter, ffes. 5 the deceased was 44 years of age when she died. at the time of her death, she was the head of regional market development at roche diagnostics asia pacific pte ltd (“roche”), where she had worked for the past 20 years. her performance appraisals showed that she was a valued officer of the company. 6 the first respondent was the deceased’s husband, mr seto wei meng (“mr seto”), while the second respondent was mr seto’s father. mr seto and the second respondent were the administrator and co-administrator of the deceased’s estate respectively. the action was brought by the respondents on behalf of the estate of the deceased as well as the deceased’s dependants. the dependants included the deceased’s parents (her father having died some three years four months after the deceased’s death); the two sons of the marriage (named marcus and melvin); and mr seto, who claimed for loss of support for household expenses, expenses related to the “hilloft” condominium property which was jointly owned by the deceased and mr seto (“hilloft property”), and the loss of car expenses. mr seto also brought a loss of inheritance claim under s 22(1a) of the civil law act (cap 43, 1999 rev ed). 7 in their statement of claim, the respondents allege that dr foo was negligent in three respects. first, dr foo failed to obtain the deceased’s informed consent and did not properly advise her on the risks and complications associated with the surgical procedures; furthermore, dr foo failed to explain that the surgical procedures would entail a higher risk of fat embolism, particularly as it involved a repeat procedure. secondly, dr foo was negligent in carrying out the surgical procedures. thirdly, dr foo was negligent in his post-operative management and care of the deceased by, inter alia, failing to call for an ambulance in time. dr foo denied all three allegations. 8 the high court judge (the “judge”) found dr foo liable in negligence in relation to the surgical procedures. the judge awarded the respondents damages in the sum of $5,599,557.48 (plus coroner’s inquiry (“ci”) fees to be taxed if not agreed) together with interest and costs. the appellant appeals against the judge’s decision on both his liability and the quantum of damages awarded.the court of appeal’s decision9 the court of appeal dismissed dr foo’s appeal against liability for negligence, and allowed in part dr foo’s appeal on the quantum of damages awarded.liability10 the court of appeal rejected dr foo’s contention that, because what had occurred was ffes, the deceased was doomed to die, even if dr foo had called for an ambulance at 2.05pm. this was not a conclusion anyone could draw from the evidence presented in this case as well as the expert medical evidence before the judge. all the doctors who gave evidence held the view or agreed that dr foo should have called for an ambulance immediately or very soon after the onset of the deceased’s symptoms after the deceased’s oxygen saturation level plummeted to 72% at 2.05pm. significantly, the first two doctors called in to help with the emergency situation that had developed, dr chow yuen ho (“dr chow”) and dr shenthilkumar s/o sritharan naidu (“dr shenthilkumar”), also came to the same conclusion upon assessing the situation. it was noteworthy that dr foo did not submit any specific data for ffes found in the medical literature to support his contention. on the contrary, the medical literature placed before the court even included a case of ffes which, with timely detection, survived apparently without any ill effects: at [15], [21] and [29].11 the court of appeal agreed with the judge’s finding below that dr foo was not au fait with that potential problem of fes, let alone ffes, and was unable to recognise what had occurred to the deceased when her oxygen saturation level plummeted to 72% and she was coughing, making gurgling sounds and unable to articulate what was wrong. dr foo had no valid excuse to delay calling for an ambulance in the critical 48 minutes (2.05pm to 2.53pm): at [19] and [21].12 the court of appeal rejected dr foo’s submission that the clinic had available medical equipment which was put to use. the specialist medical and resuscitative equipment, available medical expertise and facilities at a tertiary institution, like sgh, were unarguably superior compared to what was available at the clinic. the fact was that the clinic did not have the medical equipment and facilities that sgh had, eg, the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: at [23].13 while it was normally incumbent on the plaintiff to prove causation, here it was dr foo who mounted an affirmative case that, even if he was in breach of his duty, there would be no causation because the deceased was suffering from ffes. thus, it was incumbent on dr foo to make good this assertion. this was not supported by the expert and medical evidence, which was that ffes was not necessarily fatal: at [25].14 the court of appeal found that the judge was also right to find that ffes is a retrospective diagnosis, so the fact that ffes itself is “almost always deadly” was beside the point. the significance of a “retrospective” diagnosis was that, if a patient with fes or ffes is given prompt treatment, and the patient recovers, the case would then typically not be characterised or labelled as ffes: at [33].15 therefore, the totality of the evidence showed that dr foo clearly breached his duty of care to the deceased and this breach caused the deceased’s death. for the foregoing reasons, dr foo’s appeal on liability was dismissed: at [36] to [39].quantum of damages for estate claim16 dr foo conceded that the ci fees were payable by dr foo. the respondents proposed a sum of $26,000 for the ci fees, which dr foo found not to be unreasonable. the court of appeal accordingly awarded the respondents $26,000 for the ci fees: at [42].quantum of damages for dependency claim17 the court of appeal reduced the damages awarded for mr seto’s loss of support claim from $1,400,415.93 to $697,302.96. this was because the sum of $703,112.97 awarded by the judge to the respondents for the mortgage instalment payments should not have been awarded. the mortgage instalment payments represented the use of the deceased’s income to acquire an asset – the hilloft property – which mr seto will own at the end of the day. there would thus be an element of double counting, as mr seto would get not only the use of the money but also the value of the money. the parties had, since the oral hearing, agreed that the sum of $703,112.97 for the mortgage instalment payments should not be awarded. accordingly, the court of appeal reduced the damages awarded by this amount: at [48] and [50].18 on the other hand, the property-related expenses (including condominium maintenance fees, property insurance, and property tax) were claimable, as they were indeed benefits which mr seto would have received from the deceased, if not for her demise. therefore, the court of appeal did not disturb the judge’s award of damages for the property-related expenses amounting to $113,850: at [49].quantum of damages for loss of inheritance claim19 the court of appeal found that the judge had erred when he applied the deceased’s pre-tax, rather than post-tax, income to determine the appropriate multiplicand for the respondents’ claim for loss of inheritance from the deceased’s projected income. it was settled law that claims based on loss of earnings must be net of income tax. this was because a tribunal should award the injured party such a sum of money as will put him in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the injuries: at [54], [57] and [59].20 the court of appeal agreed with the respondents that a 25% discount for the deceased’s personal expenditure should be applied to the deceased’s post-tax income of $625,335.14, rather than the pre-tax income of $754,468.13. the court of appeal did not disturb the judge’s finding that the deceased would have spent $90,000 for the deceased’s expenditure on her dependants. this meant that the revised multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim should be $379,001.36. the revised loss of inheritance claim for loss of projected income would thus be $2,615,109.35 instead of $3,283,372.59: at [63], [65] and [66].21 the court of appeal also found that the judge had erred in awarding the respondents’ claim for loss of inheritance from the deceased’s loss of various long-term stock options awarded to the deceased by roche. the judge himself rightly observed that there was limited evidence available. the deceased was not issued any new stock options from 2010 to 2013. there was no evidence on how the stock options were to be issued by the employer and no evidence as to its terms or on how the value of the stock options were to be determined. therefore, the judge’s basis for applying a multiplicand of 1000 stock options per year was an inference which could not be drawn from the evidence, as there was no clear pattern that new stock options would be issued every year. consequently, the court of appeal set aside the judge’s award of $556,500 for loss of inheritance in relation to the stock options. the total sum of the loss of inheritance claim would thus be $2,615,109.35 (for loss of projected income) instead of $3,839,872.59: at [68] to [70].22 as such, the court of appeal allowed the appeal on the quantum of damages in part as follows: at [72].trial judge's findingsour findingsestate claimfuneral, medical expenses, letters of administration, and general damages$31,390.99$31,390.99ci fees(to be taxed or
