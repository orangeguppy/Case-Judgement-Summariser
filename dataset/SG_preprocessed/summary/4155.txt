-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



decision of the court of appeal (delivered by chief justice sundaresh

menon):





outcome: coa dismisses appeal against sicc’s finding that there

was a repudiatory breach of the joint venture deed, but remits matter to

sicc to determine whether the first respondent had the financial ability to

fund the joint venture company.



pertinent and significant points of the judgment




seldon v davidson 

    [1968] 1 wlr 1083 (“seldon”) was wrongly decided insofar

    as it held that where a party admitted to having received a sum of

    money, there was prima facie an obligation to repay. the

    relevant question was not whether a party had admitted to receiving

    a sum of money, but whether it had admitted to incurring a debt (at            [141]–[144]).

    




    where an issue was squarely and properly placed before the court,

    the court ought to decide it. where the evidence was incomplete

    such that the court could not make a finding one way or the other,

    the question of fact raised was to be decided on the basis of who

    bore the burden of proof (at [170]).

    



background





    this appeal arose out of a dispute between the appellants (“the

    appellants”) and the respondents (“the respondents”) over their

    joint venture to upgrade and sell the appellants’ coal. the matter

    was heard by the singapore international commercial court (“the

    court”) in separate tranches, and this appeal concerned only the

    court’s decision in the second tranche.

    


the material facts




    the appellants were pt bayan resources tbk (“br”) and bayan

    international pte ltd (“bi”). br owned a number of coal mining

    subsidiaries in indonesia, including pt bara tabang (“bara”) and pt

    fajar sakti prima (“fsp”).

    




    the respondents were bcbc singapore pte ltd (“bcbcs”) and

    binderless coal briquetting company pty limited (“bcbc”). both of

    them were indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of white energy

    company ltd (“wec”).

    




    in 2006, bcbc and bi entered into a joint venture deed (“the jv

    deed”) for the construction and commissioning of a coal briquette

    processing plant in indonesia (“the tabang plant”). pursuant to a

    deed of novation executed in 2009, bcbcs and br were substituted

    for bcbc and bi respectively as the parties to the jv deed. in

    connection with the joint venture, the parties incorporated an

    indonesian joint venture company, pt kaltim supacoal (“ksc”), with

    bcbcs holding 51% and bi, 49% of the issued shares.

    




    friction between the parties started to develop by november 2007,

    when they realised that they had underestimated the costs of the

    tabang plant. to exacerbate matters, in october 2010, a piece of

    legislation which set the benchmark price for the sale of minerals

    and coal in indonesia (“the hba price”) came into force.

    




    these developments led the parties and ksc to enter into a series

    of agreements, which included:

    





        a “priority loan funding agreement” (“the plfa”) between ksc, br

        and bcbcs. under the plfa, bcbcs was to advance a revolving working

        capital facility of up to us$20m (later increased to us$40m) to

        ksc; while br was to provide ksc with a “coal advance”, which

        entailed br supplying coal to ksc at the market price but requiring

        payment of only us$8 per tonne upon delivery.

        




        coal supply agreements (“the 2010 csas”) between ksc and br’s coal

        mining subsidiaries, bara and fsp. under the 2010 csas, bara and

        fsp were to supply coal to ksc at the hba price. however, pursuant

        to the “coal advance” under the plfa, ksc only had to pay us$8 per

        tonne upfront.

        





    things came to a head in the last quarter of 2011. at a ksc board

    meeting in early november 2011 (“the november 2011 board meeting”),

    the appellants indicated that they wanted to exit the joint

    venture, and that they were willing to sell their shares in ksc to

    the respondents and wec (collectively, “the wec parties”). the

    appellants were happy for the wec parties to continue with the

    joint venture on their own, and while br remained willing to supply

    coal to ksc, this would have to be on arms’ length terms and “at

    commercial rates”. on 7 november 2011, shortly after the november

    2011 board meeting, ksc requested for “a lot of coal” from bara and

    fsp.

    




    on 9 november 2011, wec made a public announcement on the

    australian stock exchange to the effect that br had formed the view

    that the joint venture might not be economically viable. on the

    same day, after wec’s announcement, br instructed bara and fsp to

    stop supplying coal to ksc.

    




    following the cessation of coal supply to ksc, a meeting between

    the parties was held on 17 november 2011 (“the 17 november 2011

    meeting”). during the meeting, the appellants reiterated their

    desire to exit the joint venture, and again raised the possibility

    of the wec parties buying out their share of the joint venture for

    us$45m, which was the amount that they had invested up to that

    point in time. the only contemporaneous notes of the meeting

    suggested that the understanding between the parties was that br

    would not resume the supply of coal to ksc until the appellants’

    shares in ksc were bought out (“the buyout condition”).

    




    on 6 december 2011, an extraordinary general meeting of ksc’s

    shareholders (“the 6 december 2011 egm”) was held. at that meeting,

    the appellants reiterated their intention to exit the joint

    venture, and intimated their desire to liquidate ksc unless their

    stake in ksc was bought out. they also denied having imposed the

    buyout condition, and maintained that br would continue supplying

    coal to ksc at the hba price. it is undisputed that the meeting

    also touched on the possibility of putting the tabang plant into

    care and maintenance, although the parties were divided as to

    whether there was an agreement to do so. on 15 december 2011, the

    tabang plant was put into care and maintenance.

    




    on 27 december 2011, the respondents commenced legal proceedings

    against the appellants. approximately two months later, on 21

    february 2012, br wrote to bcbcs purporting to terminate the jv

    deed. among other things, br alleged that bcbcs had breached the

    terms of the jv deed by unilaterally causing ksc to exceed its

    budget by about us$7m (“the excess expenditure”), and to exceed the

    us$40m plfa facility limit by extending a further loan of about

    us$6m to ksc (“the excess debt”). on 2 march 2012, bcbcs replied

    stating that br’s purported termination constituted a wrongful

    repudiation of the jv deed, which it accepted.

    


the issues on appeal




    there were four main issues on appeal, namely (at            [68]):

    





        whether br was obliged to procure and/or ensure the supply of coal

        to ksc during the period from november 2011 to 2 march 2012 (“the

        obligation issue”);

        




        if br was under such an obligation, whether br breached that

        obligation, and if so, whether that breach constituted a

        repudiation of the jv deed (“the breach issue”);

        




        whether br repudiated the jv deed by issuing the termination notice

        in its letter of 21 february 2012 (“the repudiation issue”); and

        




        if br repudiated the jv deed, whether such repudiation caused any

        loss to bcbcs, and if so, what was the period for which bcbcs was

        entitled to damages (“the causation issue”).

        



the decision on appeal


the obligation issue




    in respect of the obligation issue, the court of appeal (“the coa”)

    rejected the appellants’ argument that br was not contractually

    obliged to procure and/or ensure the supply of coal to ksc under

    the jv deed and/or the plfa during the period from november 2011 to

    2 march 2012.

    

 





    the coa first held that the “business” defined in the jv deed

    remained in operation during the aforesaid period despite the

    tabang plant having been put into care and maintenance, and thus,

    br’s obligation under the jv deed to procure the supply of coal

    “for the operation of the business” continued to apply. in this

    regard, the coa pointed out that cll 7.1(x) and 11 of the jv deed

    undercut the appellants’ contention that either party to the jv

    deed could unilaterally bring about the cessation of ksc’s

    operations and business simply by refusing to provide funding (at            [74]–[77]).

    

 





    second, the coa rejected the appellants’ argument that art 7.1 of

    the plfa did not impose a separate and free-standing obligation on

    br to ensure that bara and fsp supplied coal to ksc pursuant to the

    2010 csas. it noted that art 7 of the plfa refined br’s coal supply

    obligation to include an obligation to ensure that ksc was liable

    to pay only us$8 per tonne upfront for the coal supplied. it was

    difficult to see how br could have advanced coal to ksc at this

    stipulated upfront payment price without also simultaneously having

    an obligation to ensure the supply of coal to ksc (at            [78]–[80]).

    




    third, the coa found that br’s coal supply obligation under the jv

    deed and the plfa was not affected by whether ksc could have paid

    bara and fsp for the coal supplied under the 2010 csas. this was

    because cll 10.8 and 10.14 of the 2010 csas indicated that bara’s

    and fsp’s coal supply obligations, and, in turn, br’s obligation to

    ensure that bara and fsp fulfilled those obligations, were

    independent of ksc’s payment obligation (at            [81]–[82]).

    




    fourth, the coa rejected the appellants’ argument that bara and fsp

    were not obliged to supply coal to ksc because the latter already

    had sufficient coal for testing the tabang plant. in this regard,

    the coa upheld the court’s finding that as at november 2011, the

    tabang plant was close to the stage of commissioning that required

    coal for testing and did not have sufficient coal in its stockpile

    for this purpose. the coa agreed with the court that the evidence

    of ksc’s site operations manager (“mr reilly”) on these matters was

    more probative than that of the appellants’ expert witness (“mr

    alderman”), given that mr reilly was present at the site at the

    material time in november 2011 whereas mr alderman was not. the coa

    also held that the court had correctly ignored those parts of mr

    alderman’s report on the tabang plant which concerned the

    deficiencies in the plant’s design since those deficiencies were

    not in issue before the court (at [83]–[97]).

    




    fifth, the coa rejected the appellants’ contention that ksc’s

    request for “a lot of coal” on 7 november 2011 was too vague and

    open-ended to trigger bara’s and fsp’s coal supply obligations

    under the 2010 csas. it pointed out that cl 3.9 of the 2010 csas

    did not require ksc to specify a particular quantity in its

    requests for coal for testing purposes (at [98]).

    


the breach issue




    with regard to the breach issue, the coa held that there was no

    merit in the appellants’ argument that br was justified in

    instructing bara and fsp to cease supplying coal to ksc on 9

    november 2011 due to an impasse as to the price of coal. it was

    clear from the documentary evidence that this instruction was given

    on the basis that the appellants had decided to withdraw from the

    joint venture, and not because of any impasse as to price. further,

    there was in fact no impasse on price as fsp’s monthly invoices for

    the coal supplied in 2011 showed that the price had been set at

    us$29.70 per tonne. even if there had been any impasse on price,

    this ought to have been resolved by the price setting mechanism

    under cl 8.2 of the csas instead of by ceasing coal supply to ksc

    (at [103]–[104]).

    




    the coa also found, based on the notes of the 17 november 2011

    meeting, that br had imposed the buyout condition at that meeting.

    among other things, the coa held that it was incongruous for the

    appellants to aver that the buyout condition had not been imposed

    when they maintained during the 6 december 2011 egm that br would

    insist on liquidating ksc if its stake in ksc were not bought out.

    the coa thus upheld the court’s finding that br had breached its

    coal supply obligation. as this obligation was fundamental to the

    joint venture, br’s breach was repudiatory of the jv deed (at            [105]–[112]).

    


the repudiation issue




    the repudiation issue centred on whether br was justified in

    issuing its termination notice of 21 february 2012. this in turn

    depended on whether, as the appellants contended, bcbcs had

    repudiated the jv deed by unilaterally causing ksc to incur the

    excess debt and the excess expenditure, and by unilaterally causing

    the tabang plant to be put into care and maintenance on 15 december

    2011. the coa found that none of these alleged grounds for

    terminating the jv deed were valid.

    




    with regard to the excess debt, the coa found that bcbcs did not

    unilaterally cause ksc to incur this debt, albeit for slightly

    different reasons from those of the court. construing cl 7.1 of the

    jv deed as a whole, the coa considered that this clause

    differentiated between member funding and third party funding.

    where a party unilaterally caused ksc to receive member funding,

    this would constitute a breach of cl 7.1 (specifically, cl 7.1(hh))

    only if the member concerned created an obligation on ksc’s part to

    repay the funds advanced. the us$6m extended by bcbcs to ksc on top

    of the us$40m plfa facility did not result in an obligation on

    ksc’s part to repay bcbcs, and it therefore could not be said that

    there was a breach of the jv deed (at [119]–[147]

    ).

    




    in reaching the aforesaid conclusion, the coa rejected the

    appellants’ reliance on seldon v davidson [1968] 1 wlr

    1083 (“seldon”) to argue that the onus was on the

    respondents to show that ksc had no obligation to repay bcbcs. the

    coa cast doubt on the correctness of seldon insofar as it

    stood for the proposition that where a party admitted to receiving

    a sum of money, there was prima facie an obligation to

    repay. the relevant question, the coa held, was not whether a party

    had admitted to receiving a sum of money, but whether it had

    admitted to incurring a debt. on the facts, the respondents’

    pleadings denied the appellants’ excess debt argument. this meant

    that the appellants bore the burden of proving that ksc had

    incurred the excess debt, which burden they had failed to discharge

    (at [134]–[146]).

    




    as for the excess expenditure, the coa dismissed the appellants’

    contention that bcbcs had unilaterally caused ksc to incur that

    expenditure. it highlighted that ksc was itself responsible for

    making decisions on its expenditure; moreover, br had control over

    ksc’s expenditure by way of its ability to refuse to sign ksc’s

    cheques (at [148]–[151]).

    




    the coa also found that bcbcs had not unilaterally placed the

    tabang plant into care and maintenance. the evidence showed that

    the parties had agreed at the 6 december 2011 egm to implement a

    care and maintenance program, with possibly only the apportionment

    of the costs of the program left open (at            [152]–[156]).

    


the causation issue




    the causation issue concerned the appellants’ argument that any

    breaches of the jv deed by br had not caused bcbcs any loss because

    ksc lacked funding and thus would have been unable to get the

    tabang plant to the point where it could undertake commercial

    production (at [158]).

    




    the coa held that the key question at the heart of the causation

    issue was whether bcbcs was willing and able to fund ksc by itself.

    it agreed with the court that bcbcs was willing to fund ksc

    unilaterally, noting, among other things, that bcbcs had continued

    to fund ksc even after br first expressed its desire to withdraw

    from the joint venture (at [161]–[167]).

    




    as for whether bcbcs was able to fund ksc by itself, the coa

    observed that the court had reserved its decision on this point to

    the next tranche of trial on the basis that there was insufficient

    evidence before it, and held that the court was not entitled to do

    so. the issue of bcbcs’s ability to fund ksc had been squarely and

    properly before the court as it was intricately tied to the

    question of whether ksc had sufficient funds to keep operating the

    tabang plant. the court therefore ought to have decided the issue.

    consequently, the coa remitted this issue to the court for its

    determination (at [168]–[177]).
