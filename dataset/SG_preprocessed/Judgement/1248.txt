 the first representation, and as a corollary, the fourth, fifth and seventh representations, would have been false if wong had made them (the judgment at [15]). since the fourth, fifth and seventh representations were dependent on pixeltrade having been approved for investment by uob in the first place, the first representation was of prime importance (the judgment at [18] to [20]). however, there was a sea change in poh’s case between what was pleaded (and as stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) and what was advanced in poh’s opening statement and at trial concerning the first representation. instead of alleging that wong had positively made the first representation (as pleaded), poh asserted that wong had omitted to inform poh that pixeltrade was not a uob-approved product (the judgment at [27] to [33]).

 the judge went on to consider whether the representations were made, focusing on the first representation.18 he found that none of the representations was evidenced in writing, nor did the whatsapp messages between poh and wong refer to the representations (the judgment at [26]). it was hence merely a case of poh’s word against wong’s word that the representations had been made (the judgment at [26]). the judge believed wong’s evidence over poh’s, namely, that wong had never made the representations, and that poh’s investment in pixeltrade was not made in reliance on any of the representations (the judgment at [93]). he also accepted that wong had told poh that pixeltrade was not uob-approved (the judgment at [94]). 19 first, the mwp forms signed by poh pertaining to the four bonds ([2] above) stated that the principal was not guaranteed,

 at [62]). the findings of a trial judge should be taken as prima facie correct and should not be disturbed in the absence of sound reasons. an appellate court will be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact unless it can be shown that those findings were plainly wrong or were against the weight of the evidence before the court. if the trial judge’s findings of fact are based on his assessment of the witnesses’ veracity and credibility, the appellate court should exercise even more restraint in overturning such findings.34 in the present case, poh, as the plaintiff, bears the burden of proving that the first representation was made. as the judge noted, there is no direct documentary or material evidence to prove or disprove whether wong had made the first representation (and other representations) to poh. the question rests on poh’s word against wong’s word, as well as inferences which can be drawn from the correspondence, documents, and other circumstances. in such a situation, the court should refrain from overruling the judge unless the inferences he drew were plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. 35 in our view, there is no basis for us to disturb the judge’s main conclusion that the first representation was not made. we agree with the judge that poh’s inexplicable delay in complaining about the first representation suggests that it was not made. poh raises various arguments and points which he claims the judge had failed to consider. however, they do not assist him because his arguments or points are either not borne out by the evidence or are contradicted by the evidence; or are equivocal, as they merely suggest, at their highest, that the judge had relied on evidence which he should not have in reaching his decision. although we think that the judge may have erred in finding that the fifth and sixth representations were not made, this is inconsequential as poh has not proved that these representations were false.the “sea change” in poh’s case36 we first address the judge’s view that poh had shifted his case on the first representation. the judge referred to this as a “sea change”.37 poh’s pleaded case with regard to the first representation was that wong had told him that pixeltrade was uob-approved. 38 however, the judge noted that poh’s opening statement for the trial made a different allegation, ie, that wong neglected to inform poh that pixeltrade was not approved by uob for investment. thus, the judge stated at [30] and [31] of the judgment that: 30 [poh’s] opening statement states at paras 22–23:[wong] made various representations in relation to the pixeltrade product which led [poh] to believe that the pixeltrade product was [uob’s] approved investment product. …if the pixeltrade product was not [uob’s] approved investment product, [wong] neglected and failed to inform [poh] of the same, whether in writing or otherwise.31 the assertion that [wong] neglected or failed to correct [poh’s] belief that his pixeltrade investment was uob-approved has not been pleaded. moreover, it is an allegation of negligence, rather than of fraud.[emphasis in original]39 the judge also referred to poh’s counsel’s cross-examination of wong where he had suggested that wong had failed to mention to poh that the product had not been approved by uob for investment. we set out below the relevant extract of the transcript during the trial on 14 august 2020:

[wong]: um. [poh]: ... on all the things i filled up, i tell you ‘low risk’ [sic]. [wong]: ok, at this point in time, right, i can... i can tell you from the bottom of my heart, right, this is a low-risk product. ok? this, as far as i'm being told lah, at any point in time, right, you want to have your funds back— … [poh]: if i want to find these investment ah, i don’t have to go through you, know? i can go everywhere? why i’m not doing it? i already told you from the very beginning: i only want to do thing that is uob-approved. from the very beginning! and bond... that one to be very safe. and this, my retirement fund [sic].

 it therefore appears to us that poh, even at the appeal stage, is unable to make up his mind as to whether he was alleging that wong had actually represented to him, before the investments were made, that pixeltrade was low-risk, or that wong had recommended the product to him because wong had thought (to himself) that it was low-risk.48 we accept that wong had recommended pixeltrade to poh. however, that is not enough for poh to succeed. even if wong had negligently thought that pixeltrade was low-risk, that would not assist poh because poh is no longer pursuing a negligence claim on appeal.49 as regards the question of whether wong had represented to poh that pixeltrade was a low-risk product before the investments were made, we do not need to consider it as this was not one of the representations which poh had pleaded.50 in so far as the transcript of the audio recording shows that wong had admitted that he had recommended pixeltrade to poh because many others in uob were also investing in it, that too does not assist poh because it was not clear from the transcripts whether wong was saying that he had made this representation to poh before poh invested in pixeltrade, or whether wong was saying that he had himself believed this but had not made such a representation. in any case, even if wong had made that representation, which is the sixth representation, poh did not prove that it was false and he thus did not prove deceit on this basis. 51 in relation to the first representation, which is the focus of poh’s appeal, the audio recording does not suggest that the representation was made.52 in so far as poh relies on the whatsapp messages between himself and wong on 23 october 2018 to suggest that wong had not disagreed with his accusation of deceit, poh has only selectively quoted the portions which serve his case, but these do not reflect the full picture. we set out the full context of the relevant whatsapp messages here:

 in any event, the evidence which poh relies on does not lead to any inference that the first representation was made.56 third, poh argues that there were no independent means available to him to confirm whether pixeltrade was uob-approved, and he had to rely on wong’s word on this.

 however, this is equivocal because even if poh had no other way of verifying if pixeltrade was uob-approved, it does not mean that wong had made the first representation.57 there is some other evidence which poh raises to support his case: poh had emailed wong at his official uob email account concerning pixeltrade;

 58 however, these pieces of evidence, even if taken as true, do not aid poh’s case. they do not necessarily mean that wong had made the first representation. furthermore, the fact that wong undertook to pay poh back is in itself equivocal. wong could have felt responsible for recommending pixeltrade to poh, and such conduct was not necessarily because wong had made any misrepresentation to poh. the judge’s alleged errors 59 we now turn to discuss some points on which poh claims the judge had erred by placing weight on. 60 first, poh argues that the judge erred in relying on the mwp forms as poh had not read the forms, and there is an apparent contradiction in wong’s testimony relating to the forms (see [28(a)] and [28(b)] above). 61 however, even if poh had not read these forms, it only means that the judge should not have concluded from the terms in the forms that poh had a risk profile which was moderate to high or that poh should have appreciated that investments made through uob were not risk-free. 62 second, poh argues that the judge erred in giving weight to the fact that poh had approached pixeltrade first to recover his investments instead of uob. poh submits that this was not contrary to the allegation that the first representation was made, and he had only approached pixeltrade first in order to mitigate his loss, and even then, only on wong’s advice. we disagree and are of the view that this was an inference which the judge was entitled to draw. furthermore, even if the judge was wrong to do so, it was only one of the multifarious pieces of evidence he relied upon in deciding against poh.  63 third, poh argues that the judge erred in finding that wong was unlikely to have encouraged poh to make a police report if wong had made misrepresentations, because the whatsapp communications show that it was poh who first threatened to make a police report.

                   90

 however, even if poh was the one who first threatened to make a police report, this was equivocal. the fact is that wong did agree that poh should make a police report and correspondingly, the judge was entitled to draw the inference which he did.64 fourth, poh argues that the judge was wrong in finding that as the pixeltrade investment did not feature in poh’s monthly statements from uob, poh would have known that it was not purchased through uob, since there were also other uob investments which did not feature in such monthly statements. we note that one of uob’s witnesses admitted that a certain “aia platinum legacy policy” was a uob-approved product which did not feature in poh’s monthly statements from uob,

 which showed that not all uob-approved products would feature therein. therefore, it may be that the judge should not have relied on this in his finding. however, again, this was only one among various pieces of evidence which he relied on. 65 we are of the view that the above alleged errors made by the judge, even if we take poh’s case at its highest and consider them collectively, would not materially change the outcome of poh’s claim. even if the judge was wrong to rely on such evidence to find against poh, the burden of proof lies on poh to positively prove his case on the first representation, and we find that he has not done so.poh’s conduct66 in particular, poh’s conduct did not support his case that the first representation was made. the evidence suggests that poh did not explicitly complain about the first representation and that his allegation was a mere afterthought.67 first, as mentioned above at [43], poh’s counsel was not consistent as to what poh’s main allegation was. he had conflated the allegation that the first representation was made with the allegation that wong had omitted to warn poh that pixeltrade was not approved by uob.68 second, also as mentioned above at [51], the recording of the meeting on 28 august 2018 did not establish that the first representation was made. this is significant because according to poh, he had found out from goh only the day before that pixeltrade was not uob-approved. if this had been the case and wong had indeed made the first representation, poh would almost certainly have confronted wong on this very matter when they met on 28 august 2018, but he did not.

69 third, also as mentioned above at [52], while poh accused wong of deceiving him in the 23 october 2018 whatsapp messages, wong denied he had deceived poh. furthermore, poh did not mention the first representation explicitly.70 fourth, the police report made by poh on 26 october 2018 made no mention that wong had deceived poh, nor did it contain anything about the first representation.71 fifth, poh finally raised the issue of the loss of his pixeltrade investment to uob on 3 november 2018 when he wrote to uob’s deputy chairman and chief executive officer (“3 november 2018 letter”). parts of that document are cited in the judgment at [73] and parts are cited at para 24 of the appellant’s case. we set out the letter:

…allow me to write to you for your urgent attention in the recovering of my investment worth us$500,000, under the act of your employee.i have been an uob customer for many years, owning both business and personal privilege accounts as follows:1.   business accounts number: xxxxxx2.   privilege personal account number: [xxxxxx]since year 2015/2016, uob has assigned [wong] as my uob relationship manager.as a non-sophisticated investor, i only invest in bonds or investment that has high capital protection and/or under the advise of your relationship manager. my risk appetite and profile has always been maintained with uob's relationship manager.in september 2017, your relationship manager [wong] approached me to invest in pixeltrade (uk) limited (‘pixeltrade’). i was shared the historical performance and return on investment of the company over the past 7 years. he further persuaded me that many of uob's senior relationship managers and his manager have many clients investing in this.under the impression and trust that this is an uob investment coupled with your employee's aggressive selling tactics, i invested us$200,000 on 5 october 2017. i transferred us$200,000 over the counter at uob north point yishun branch to account no. [xxxxxx] uob pixeltrade (uk) limited) as instructed.on 16 december 2017, your employee further approached me to make more investment. i make another over the counter transfer of us$300,000 to the same account at uob north point yishun branch.in january 2018, your employee asked that i withdraw the investment as pixeltrade is undergoing restructuring. he shared that he will handle all the administrative process and that i only need to authorize him to withdraw. i proceed to authorize him as instructed.later, as i chased for my investment, i was told that due to some tax related matters, uob and himself are handling the matter.only in august 2018, i received an email from uob sharing that [wong] is leaving uob. a new relationship manager [goh] then contacted me. following discussion with him, i was told that pixeltrade is not an authorized uob investment portfolio.this sequence of events, loss of us$500,000 and the undue inconveniences caused detrimental stress to both my family and myself. it has impacted my well-being, health and affected my business decisions.this issue has raised a grave and worrying concern of the integrity, trust and responsibility of your employee acting on behalf of uob. it has also raised serious questions on the risk, corporate governance and compliance processes that uob has in place to protect innocent customers like myself.my decision to make the investment is clearly make [sic] on the basis that this is with uob and an assigned uob relationship manager.i believe this is a serious matter that warrants your urgent attention and that you will find a way to return back immediately my hard-earned us$500,000 with uob.thank you and looking forward to hearing from you soon.…72 we note that the letter does mention that wong represented to poh that many of uob’s personnel had many clients investing in the pixeltrade investment in question. this is a reference to the fifth representation. however, the letter did not mention the first representation. on the contrary, the letter suggested that poh had assumed that pixeltrade had been approved by uob for investment.73 on 15 november 2018, one mr yong, who was goh’s team leader, replied on behalf of uob. mr yong requested poh to inform uob when the police had concluded their investigation and asked for a copy of the police report and related documents for uob to investigate internally.74 subsequently, poh emailed mr yong on 3 april 2019. the salient points of the email are listed in the judgment at [77]. poh stressed that he would only invest in capital-guaranteed investments but again, he did not mention the first representation.75 on 15 april 2019, poh met with mr yong and mr yong’s colleagues, one mr beh and one mr tham. these uob representatives gave evidence that at the meeting, poh had admitted that he was aware that pixeltrade was not approved by uob. poh disputes this. he alleges that he did tell them about the representations. the uob representatives deny that he told them this.  76 on 23 may 2019, poh sent an email to mr yong. the contents of the email are set out at [85] of the judgment. we will set out the first sentence only:my decision to invest in the pixel trade was solely based on the fact that [wong] was the rm who uob privilage [sic] banking assigned to me.77 as the judge observed, this cited sentence is telling. poh was saying that his investment in pixeltrade was “solely” based on the fact that wong was the relationship manager assigned to him by uob. there was no mention of any of the representations. this is telling because if poh had indeed told the uob representatives about the representations at the meeting on 15 april 2019, he would have followed up on the representations in his email to mr yong. 78 on 10 june 2019, uob wrote to poh to say that it was unable to accede to poh’s request for compensation (as stated in his earlier letter dated 3 november 2018).79 on 12 june 2019, poh’s lawyers sent a letter of demand to uob. the judge referred to this letter at [88] and [89] of the judgment where he noted:88 on 12 june 2019, [poh’s] lawyers sent uob a letter of demand. in it, they said that [poh] had been induced to invest in pixeltrade by three representations made by [wong]:a. a uob approved investment product was a product called pixeltrade (the ‘pixeltrade product’);b. the pixeltrade product had, over the preceding 7 years, garnered handsome yields and/or returns on investment for uob’s customers; andc. uob was then actively recommending the pixeltrade product to uob’s privilege banking customers.89 representation (a) was referred to in [poh’s] whatsapp chat with [wong] in october 2018 (and denied by [wong]), but representations (b) and (c) appear for the first time in this letter of demand. the other four representations in the statement of claim were still conspicuously missing. in particular, the 4th representation that uob was guaranteeing investments in pixeltrade was not in the letter of demand. if, as [poh] claims, he had mentioned all seven representations at the meeting with the uob officers on 15 april 2019, why were only three of the seven representations mentioned in the letter of demand sent approximately two months later?80 on 24 june 2019, uob’s lawyers replied to deny liability on uob’s part. 81 on 26 july 2019, poh’s new lawyers wrote to say that he would be commencing action against uob. however, this letter did not mention any representation in addition to the three previously mentioned in the letter of demand.82 on 29 july 2019, poh commenced the present action against uob.83 we elaborate on the first written communication from poh to uob dated 3 november 2018 and poh’s three arguments in respect of that letter. 84 first, the appellant’s case at para 36 argues that the judge was wrong to rely on the fact that the 3 november 2018 letter did not contain allegations of misrepresentation, because poh had already made these allegations in his earlier contemporaneous exchanges with wong (“first argument”).85 second, the appellant’s case at para 37 argues, in response to the judge’s finding that poh had not mentioned the representations in the meeting of 15 april 2019, that poh had already made his position “abundantly clear” in his 3 november 2018 letter (“second argument”).86 third, para 29 of poh’s skeletal arguments argues that poh is a lay person and not legally trained. he had already mentioned in the 3 november 2018 letter that wong had approached him to invest in pixeltrade and his decision to invest was on the basis that this was with uob and through an assigned uob relationship manager. poh was unsure how much clearer he was required to be in the letter (“third argument”).87 in our view, it is insufficient for poh to argue that wong had recommended the investment to him or that he had acted on the basis or assumption that pixeltrade was an investment approved by uob. it is one thing to assume that it was approved by uob and another to allege that wong had told him so. the 3 november 2018 letter made no mention of the first representation. poh’s second and third arguments that the letter was “abundantly clear” or that he was unsure how much clearer he was required to be is a straw man’s argument. 88 if the 3 november 2018 letter was already “abundantly clear”, then it would have been unnecessary for poh to rely on the first or the third arguments. the fact that he raises them is telling.89 as regards the first argument, poh had only alleged once that wong had deceived him, and wong had denied it on that occasion. we have already elaborated on that above. more importantly, if poh was able to blame wong for deceiving him that pixeltrade was approved by uob, then surely, he could have raised this allegation and specifically the first representation to the police or to wong’s superiors. poh’s act of accusing wong of deceit contradicts his third argument which suggests that poh did not know how to be more explicit because he was only a lay person. the fact is that poh did not explicitly mention the first representation despite having had various opportunities to do so. it bears repeating that in his email of 23 may 2019, he said that the sole reason for the investment was the fact that wong was the relationship manager assigned to him by uob.      90 in these circumstances, the judge was entitled to take into account poh’s omission to explicitly mention the first representation in deciding to believe wong and not poh in relation to the first representation. while there is some evidence from the recording of the meeting on 28 august 2018 that wong might have made the sixth representation and the 3 november 2018 letter suggested that wong may have also made the fifth representation, this was not adequate for poh’s claim to succeed since poh did not prove that these representations were false. in any event, the appellant’s case focused on the first representation.       whether the judge erred in finding that vicarious liability was not made out91 in the light of the above, the question of vicarious liability on the part of uob is academic. we reserve comment as to whether the judge erred in finding that vicarious liability was not made out.conclusion92 the appeal is dismissed. the appellant estimated his costs and disbursements at a total of s$56,876.20,
