introduction
1       in this originating summons (originating summons

                    no 1135 of 2012 (“os 1135”)), the plaintiffs seek to

                    impugn s 377a of the penal code (cap 224, 2008 rev ed)

                    (“the current penal code”) on the ground that it infringes their

                    right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law under

                    art 12 of the constitution of the republic of singapore (1985 rev ed,

                    1999 reprint) (“the constitution”). section 377a reads

                    as follows:

outrages on

                        decency


377a.    any male person who, in public or

                                private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures

                            or attempts to procure the commission by any male

                                person of, any act of gross indecency with another male

                                person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term

                            which may extend to 2 years.
[emphasis added]
the facts
2       mr lim meng suang

                    (“mr lim”), the first plaintiff, is 44 years old and a

                    buddhist who was born and raised in singapore. he has his own graphic design

                    company and has a masters of fine arts in photography. mr kenneth chee

                    mun-leon (“mr chee”), the second plaintiff, is 37 years old

                    and a free thinker who was also born and raised in singapore. he is a graphic

                    designer working in mr lim’s company, and has a diploma in

                    electronics engineering. mr lim and mr chee met by chance in march

                    1997, and have been “in a romantic and sexual relationship” with

                    each other ever since, ie, for the past 16

                    years.
3       mr lim and mr chee do not live

                    together. in his supporting affidavit for os 1135, mr lim says that

                    the main reason for this is his need to stay with and look after his ageing

                    parents who are not well. mr lim also says that his parents do not know

                    that he and mr chee are gay. having said that, mr lim describes how,

                    over the years, his mother’s attitude has changed. there was an initial

                    confrontation over his friendship with mr chee, whom he had to deny was

                    gay, and her proscription not to do “gay things”. this then

                    progressed to her trying to find him a wife, with his godmother’s active

                    participation. finally, over the last three or so years, mr lim says, there

                    has been tacit, but not open, acceptance by his mother of his relationship with

                    mr chee. his mother has stopped trying to match-make him and now tells his

                    godmother to leave him alone whenever she brings up the subject of finding him a

                    wife. his mother has also started inviting mr chee over for family events

                    and even reunion dinners. mr lim accepts that his mother is from a

                    different generation and does not push the issue. however, he has told his

                    siblings as well as his elder nephews and nieces about his sexual orientation,

                    and they have all accepted his being gay. mr chee has stayed overnight with

                    mr lim at times and this practice has continued for some

                time.
4       mr chee also lives with his family. in his

                    supporting affidavit for os 1135, he deposes that his family accepts

                    mr lim as his close friend, but do not quite know the true nature of their

                    relationship. his family, unlike mr lim’s family, does not go out

                    much together, and he characterises his family’s policy as one of

                    “don’t ask, don’t tell”. mr chee is silent on

                    whether mr lim has ever stayed overnight at his home.
5       besides working together, mr lim and

                    mr chee also go to the gym as well as for movies, window-shopping and

                    overseas holidays together. both mr lim and mr chee feel that they

                    cannot be openly affectionate in public in singapore. mr lim states that at

                    most, he puts his arm around mr chee’s shoulder in public. both

                    mr lim and mr chee grew up with the knowledge that having gay sex was

                    illegal, but, more significantly, both of them felt the social stigma of being

                    gay as they were growing up, and this feeling of stigmatisation continues to

                    date.
6       both mr lim and mr chee are also

                    apprehensive as they have heard of male homosexuals being charged with

                    “gross indecency” under s 377a of the current penal code.

                    mr lim runs thebearproject, an informal

                    social group for “plus-sized” gay men who engage in activities

                    like hiking, movies, potluck gatherings, museum-hopping and overseas trips.

                    however, he is worried about getting into trouble with the authorities and

                    claims that it will be difficult to register thebearproject as a society as automatic approval is not granted

                    to societies which relate to “sexual orientation”.
7       mr lim says that he experienced

                    discrimination in school and in the army, which discrimination continues till

                    this day, although his mother no longer asks him not to be gay. similarly,

                    mr chee says that he has seen and also experienced discrimination against

                    gay people in school, in the army and in society. both mr lim and

                    mr chee feel that s 377a of the current penal code reinforces this

                    discrimination, and that the very existence of this provision, whether or not it

                    is enforced, labels them as criminals. whilst mr lim and mr chee do

                    not live in fear every day of being arrested, they say that it is always at the

                    back of their minds that if the authorities wanted to, they could arrest them

                    and charge them with an offence under s 377a of the current penal

                    code.
8       on 30 november 2012, mr lim and

                    mr chee (collectively referred to hereafter as “the

                    plaintiffs”) filed os 1135 seeking, in effect, a declaration that

                    s 377a of the current penal code is inconsistent with art 12 of the

                    constitution, and is therefore void by virtue of arts 4 and 162 of the

                    constitution. the defendant in this action, the attorney-general (“the

                    defendant”), has chosen not to file any affidavits in response. i

                    therefore take the plaintiffs’ affidavits as the factual basis on which i

                    shall proceed to decide this case.
9       in this judgment, i shall be referring to both

                    s 377a of the current penal code as well as its predecessor provisions in

                    earlier editions of our penal code. for ease of reference, i shall use the term

                    “s 377a” to denote s 377a of the current penal code and,

                    where the context requires, the applicable predecessor provision in force at the

                    particular point in time being discussed. i shall also use the terms “s

                    377” and “the now-repealed s 377” interchangeably to refer

                    to the now-repealed s 377 of the penal code (cap 224, 1985 rev

                    ed) (“the 1985 penal code”), which criminalised “carnal

                    intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals”.

                    as for the term “the constitution”, it should be read as denoting

                    either the constitution as defined at [1] above or, where the context requires,

                    the applicable predecessor version of the constitution. references to

                    “male homosexual conduct” in the context of this judgment refer to

                    acts of “gross indecency” between males, and likewise, references

                    to “female homosexual conduct” refer to acts of “gross

                    indecency” between females.
preliminary issues
locus standi
10     this action is brought under o 15

                    r 16 and o 92 r 5 of the rules of court (cap 322, r 5,

                    2006 rev ed) (“the rules”). the first requirement which the

                    plaintiffs have to meet before they can bring this action is that they must have

                    the requisite locus standi. i would have thought

                    that this was a threshold issue to be addressed as the plaintiffs have not been

                    charged under s 377a; neither have they been threatened with prosecution.

                    no state organ or officer of the law has told or warned them that they cannot

                    have the relationship which they currently have, or that if they sleep together

                    in mr lim’s family home, they will be prosecuted. no one has

                    prohibited them from cohabiting. indeed, in their supporting affidavits for

                    os 1135, the plaintiffs candidly state that the real pressure which they

                    experience on account of their relationship seems to have been from their

                    respective parents, their respective families and members of society, and not

                    from any officer of the law. this could have a possible bearing on how the court

                    exercises its discretion to determine whether the element of a real controversy

                    in the matter (see karaha bodas co llc v pertamina energy

                        trading ltd [2006] 1 slr(r) 112) is satisfied.
11     as to whether the plaintiffs have a real

                    interest in bringing this action and whether there has been a violation of their

                    personal rights, i note that the court of appeal in tan eng

                        hong v attorney-general [2012] 4 slr(r) 476 (“tan eng hong”) has stated at [126] that:
it is uncontroverted that s 377a is a law which specifically targets

                        sexually-active male homosexuals. the plain language of s 377a excludes both

                        male-female acts and female-female acts. tan professes to be a member of the

                        targeted group, and the ag has not disputed this claim. therefore, since we

                        have found that s 377a arguably violates the art 12(1) rights of its target

                        group, as a member of that group, tan’s rights have arguably been

                        violated by the mere existence of s 377a in the statute books (see above at

                        [94]). we also accept that there is a real and credible threat of

                        prosecution under s 377a (see below at [175]-[183]).
12     be that as it may, since counsel for the

                    defendant, mr aedit abdullah sc

                    (“mr abdullah sc”) from the attorney-general’s

                    chambers, has not argued that the plaintiffs do not have the requisite locus standi to bring the present proceedings, i shall

                    proceed on the basis that the defendant is not disputing that the plaintiffs do

                    have the requisite locus standi.
the requests made by the plaintiffs’ counsel in

                chambers
13     at the start of the hearing, mr peter

                    cuthbert low (“mr low”), counsel for the plaintiffs, first

                    applied for assistant professor jack lee (“asst

                    prof lee”) from the school of law, singapore management university,

                    and assistant professor lynette chua (“asst prof chua”)

                    from the law faculty, national university of singapore (“nus”), to

                    sit in for the hearing. mr low said that asst prof lee and asst

                    prof chua had been engaged by his firm from the start of these proceedings,

                    had assisted in putting the written submissions together and were part of his

                    legal team. mr low also said that he might need to consult asst

                    prof lee and asst prof chua over any legal points that might arise in

                    the course of the oral submissions. mr low confirmed that neither asst

                    prof lee nor asst prof chua held practising

                certificates.
14     mr abdullah sc objected to

                    mr low’s application, stating that asst prof lee and asst

                    prof chua were not advocates and solicitors with practising certificates

                    but merely advisors, and their presence was not necessary.

                    mr abdullah sc submitted that if mr low wanted to consult asst

                    prof lee and asst prof chua at any point during the hearing, he could

                    always ask the court for a short break to do so. mr abdullah sc also

                    submitted that in principle, asst prof lee and asst prof chua did not

                    have a sufficient “interest” in os 1135 to have the right to

                    sit in for this hearing, which was being held in chambers.

                    mr abdullah sc conceded, however, that i had the discretion to either

                    allow or disallow mr low’s application.
15     i decided to allow asst prof lee and asst

                    prof chua to sit in for the hearing on the basis that they were part of

                    mr low’s legal team and had assisted him with os 1135 from the

                    beginning as well as with the drafting of the written submissions. they were in

                    a position akin to experts, who may be allowed to sit behind counsel in a

                    hearing and whom counsel may, from time to time in the course of a hearing, turn

                    to consult. furthermore, as os 1135 raised an important constitutional

                    issue, i was particularly glad to have an assistant professor from each of our

                    law schools present: although they had no speaking rights at the hearing, they

                    could make very valuable contributions by their input through mr low.

                    indeed, i noticed many notes being passed to mr low by asst prof lee

                    and asst prof chua during the course of the oral submissions. i

                    additionally gave the parties a two-hour lunch adjournment after the

                    morning’s hearing so as to enable asst prof lee and asst

                    prof chua to fully discuss the afternoon’s reply submissions with

                    mr low. no doubt, mr abdullah sc would likewise have used that

                    long lunch adjournment to discuss his reply submissions with his

                    colleagues.
16     mr low next asked permission for

                    mr m ravi (“mr ravi”), counsel for the plaintiff in

                    originating summons no 994 of 2010 (“os 994”), to sit in

                    for the hearing. the plaintiff in os 994 is likewise challenging the

                    constitutionality of s 377a and seeks reliefs similar to those sought by

                    the plaintiffs in this case, but based on different facts. upon my query,

                    mr low clarified that this request was not from the plaintiffs nor from

                    him; instead, mr ravi had been outside my chambers and had asked

                    mr low to make the request. as mr ravi represented a different client

                    in a different case and as the proceedings before me were proceedings in

                    chambers, mr ravi did not have any interest in these proceedings other than

                    as an observer. it appeared from the correspondence exchanged between

                    mr ravi and mr low that they had discussed the developments in their

                    respective cases with each other. i was of the view that mr low was free to

                    tell mr ravi what happened in chambers after the hearing of os 1135

                    was over. moreover, mr ravi would have his chance to present his oral

                    submissions in os 994 before me on another day. i accordingly ruled against

                    his presence in chambers.
similar proceedings
17     os 994 (as mentioned above at [16]) gave

                    rise to the court of appeal’s judgment in tan eng

                        hong. os 994 was initially struck out by the high court

                    under o 18 r 19 of the rules on the basis that it disclosed no

                    reasonable cause of action and/or was frivolous and/or was an abuse of the

                    process of court. the court of appeal allowed the plaintiff’s appeal,

                    holding that he had the necessary standing to seek the declarations which he

                    sought, and gave him leave to argue his case before the high court. the court of

                    appeal said (at [184] of tan eng hong):
without going into the merits of the application, we want to acknowledge

                        that in so far as s 377a in its current form extends to private

                        consensual sexual conduct between adult males, this provision affects the

                        lives of a not insignificant portion of our community in a very real and

                        intimate way. such persons might plausibly assert that the continued

                        existence of s 377a in our statute books causes them to be

                        unapprehended felons in the privacy of their homes. the constitutionality or

                        otherwise of s 377a is thus of real public interest.
18     the court of appeal (at [185] of tan eng hong) framed a two-stage inquiry for the high

                    court to ascertain the constitutionality of s 377a under art 12 of the

                    constitution as follows:
(a)     whether the classification

                        prescribed by s 377a was founded on an intelligible differentia;

                        and
(b)     whether

                        that differentia bore a rational relation to the object sought to be

                        achieved by s 377a.

                    accordingly.
the parties’ respective cases
the plaintiffs’ submissions
19     the plaintiffs’ first argument is that

                    s 377a is contrary to art 12 because the equal protection afforded by

                    art 12(1) extends to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual

                    orientation.
20     second, the plaintiffs contend that

                    s 377a fails the test of legality under art 12 because s 377a is

                    so absurd, arbitrary and unreasonable that it cannot be considered good law. the

                    reasons given for this are that: (a) s 377a criminalises sexual

                    orientation, which is practically immutable; (b) s 377a is overly

                    broad; (c) even the government has acknowledged that s 377a has been

                    arbitrarily and selectively enforced; (d) s 377a attempts to legislate

                    morality in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner; (e) s 377a comes

                    from tainted origins; (f) s 377a causes tangible harm to a segment of

                    the population in that it limits the outreach of hiv/aids preventive measures to

                    and inflicts psychological damage on that segment of the population;

                    (g) s 377a makes it difficult for gay or bisexual men who have been

                    exploited or abused by their sexual partners to approach law enforcement

                    officers for protection, leaving them particularly vulnerable to blackmail; and

                    (h) s 377a provides potential grounds for impugning otherwise regular

                    commercial transactions involving homosexual men.
21     the plaintiffs’ third set of arguments

                    addresses the two-step test set out by the court of appeal in tan eng hong at [185] to determine the constitutionality or

                    otherwise of an allegedly unconstitutional legislative provision (“the

                    two-step tan eng hong test”) (see [18]

                    above). mr low contends that s 377a fails the first step of the test

                    as the classification which it prescribes discloses no intelligible differentia.

                    it also fails the second step of the test as the differentia upon which that

                    classification is based bears no rational relation to the object of

                    s 377a.
22     the plaintiffs’ fourth group of

                    contentions centre on international and comparative jurisprudence on a growing

                    trend outside singapore of guarding against discrimination based on sexual

                    orientation.
23     because of the plaintiffs’ emphasis in

                    their written and oral submissions that s 377a is contrary to

                    art 12(1) as it discriminates against gay or bisexual men in an arbitrary,

                    absurd and unreasonable manner, i asked mr low to clarify whether this

                    factor (viz, discrimination in an arbitrary,

                    absurd and unreasonable manner) was to be considered separate from –

                    ie, a third requirement in addition to – the

                    two-step tan eng hong test, or whether it was to

                    be treated as a concept applicable to how that two-step test was to be applied.

                    mr low clarified that this factor was an over-arching principle that sat

                    above the two-step tan eng hong test. essentially,

                    mr low’s position is that a “law which is so absurd or

                    arbitrary that it could not have been contemplated by our constitutional framers

                    as ‘law’ when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting

                    fundamental liberties cannot be good law”.[note: 1]
24     in relation to the plaintiffs’

                    submission that the classification prescribed by s 377a discloses no

                    intelligible differentia, mr low makes three points. the first is that the

                    term “gross indecency” is too vague and does not allow s 377a

                    to be applied with certainty. the second is that the vagueness of s 377a

                    means that the provision could conceivably be applied in a grossly

                    over-inclusive manner. the third point is that s 377a is under-inclusive as

                    it criminalises only male homosexual conduct and not female homosexual

                        conduct.[note: 2] it is unclear how the second

                    and third points made by mr low relate to whether the classification

                    prescribed by s 377a is founded on an intelligible differentia (viz, the first step of the two-step tan eng hong test), although they may be relevant to the inquiry

                    into whether there is a rational relation between the differentia used in

                    s 377a and the object of s 377a (viz,

                    the second step of the two-step tan eng hong

                    test).
25     mr low submits that the “main

                    intent and purpose of [s 377a] is clear: it is to prevent homosexual acts

                    by criminalising them”. he also posits “two other discernible

                    objectives” of s 377a, namely, to “not cause offence and

                    polarisation in society” and to “reflect societal conservatism and

                    preserve family values”.[note: 3]
26     mr low submits that the retention of

                    s 377a has led to the polarisation of society, which is the opposite effect

                    of what parliament intended. with regard to the objective of reflecting societal

                    conservatism and preserving family values, mr low submits that there is no

                    evidence to suggest that criminalising homosexuality will strengthen or preserve

                    stable family values, or that decriminalising homosexuality will have a negative

                    impact on family values or encourage homosexuality.[note: 4] mr low further argues that s 377a is

                    unnecessary for the maintenance of public decency and the protection of young

                    persons in light of other gender-neutral criminal provisions in the current

                    penal code which are targeted at these objectives.[note: 5]
the defendant’s submissions
27     counsel for the defendant,

                    mr abdullah sc, submits, first, that the classification prescribed by

                    s 377a is founded on an intelligible differentia and, second, that the

                    differentia bears a rational relation to the object of s 377a in terms of

                    public morality[note: 6] or public

                        health.[note: 7]
28     on the “intelligible

                    differentia” point, mr abdullah sc states that the differentia

                    which underlies the classification prescribed by s 377a is based on gender.

                    persons within the group targeted by s 377a are men committing acts of

                    “gross indecency” with other men. persons left out of the group

                    are “women committing comparable acts”.[note: 8]
29     on the “rational relation”

                    point, mr abdullah sc submits that there are two possible objectives

                    of s 377a, both of which would bear a rational relation to the differentia

                    underlying the classification prescribed by that section. the first objective of

                    s 377a is concerned with preserving public morality in relation to male

                    homosexual conduct and signifying society’s disapproval of such conduct.

                    according to mr abdullah sc, this was the purpose of s 377a when

                    it was first introduced into our penal legislation in 1938, and this purpose was

                    also reflected in the parliamentary debates in october 2007 on whether or not

                    s 377a should be repealed (“the october 2007 parliamentary

                    debates”): see singapore parliamentary debates,

                        official report (22–23 october 2007) vol 83 at

                    cols 2175–2305 and 2354–2445. mr abdullah sc also

                    submits that the october 2007 parliamentary debates further posit that the

                    retention of s 377a recognises and helps to preserve the heterosexual

                    family as the social norm in singapore, and is the result of a political balance

                    decided upon by our legislature.
30     with respect to the alternative objective of

                    safeguarding public health, mr abdullah sc argues that although this

                    objective may not have been articulated at the inception of s 377a, it

                    ought to be accepted as a justification for differentiation at the time of

                    s 377a’s enactment if it is a reasonable rationale.[note: 9] mr abdullah sc then refers to

                    various medical reports which appear to suggest that there is a higher risk of

                    certain diseases such as anal cancer, hiv/aids, syphilis, gonorrhoea and

                    chlamydia for male-male sexual acts compared to male-female and female-female

                    sexual acts.[note: 10]
31     mr abdullah sc also submits that the

                    non-inclusion of female homosexual conduct in s 377a is based on a rational

                    criterion because public morality does not target female homosexual conduct in

                    the same way as it targets male homosexual conduct. this can be inferred from

                    the existence of s 377a, the lack of an articulated public demand for

                    s 377a to be repealed and the lack of governmental legislative initiatives

                    to criminalise female homosexual acts. a possible reason for this, as submitted

                    by mr abdullah sc, is that female homosexual conduct is either less

                    prevalent or is seen as being less repugnant than male homosexual conduct.

                    mr abdullah sc also submits that the non-inclusion of female

                    homosexual conduct in s 377a shows, at most, that the classification

                    prescribed by s 377a is under-inclusive, and under-inclusive classification

                    cannot, without more, mean that the law has prescribed a classification which is

                    contrary to art 12. this is borne out of the appreciation that legislative

                    leeway should be given to parliament. in this regard, mr abdullah sc

                    cites the indian supreme court’s decision in shri ram

                        krishna dalmia v shri justice sr tendolkar (1959) scr 279

                        (“ram krishna dalmia”) at 296

                    that “the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may

                    confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the

                    clearest”.
32     lastly, mr abdullah sc submits that

                    the court must have regard to the presumption of constitutionality, which, he

                    says, assumes the constitutionality of the law and places the burden of proving

                    unconstitutionality on the person alleging it.[note: 11] thus, mr abdullah sc

                    submits, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that “either the

                    enactment or operation of the statutory differentiation was arbitrary, or, alternatively, that it does not rest upon

                        any reasonable basis”[note: 12] [emphasis in original]. the discharge of

                    this burden usually requires proof of positive evidence of arbitrariness. this

                    also means that the court is entitled to take the view that s 377a does not

                    cover female homosexual conduct as parliament has chosen not to proscribe such

                    conduct.
my analysis
the fundamental liberties enshrined in art 12(1)
33     the plaintiffs rest their arguments squarely

                    on art 12. they contend that s 377a offends the fundamental liberties

                    granted by art 12(1) and should accordingly be struck down as

                    unconstitutional. article 12(1) reads as follows:

equal

                        protection


12.—(1) all persons are equal

                        before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
…
34     the oft-cited ideals enshrined in

                    art 12(1) are that, first, all persons are equal before the law and,

                    second, all persons are entitled to the equal protection of the law. these twin

                    concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law are well

                    known and of considerable antiquity. courts have traced these concepts’

                    origins to the magna carta, also called the magna carta liberatum (the great

                    charter of the liberties of england), signed at runnymede in 1215, where the

                    king of england conceded that he was not the fount of all law and justice and

                    introduced the idea of the supremacy of the law of the land. thereafter, the

                    last vestiges of the feudal system with monarchical supremacy and aristocratic

                    privileges were swept away by the french revolution beginning in 1789 with a

                    reputed battle cry which included the words “equality” and

                    “liberty”. it is not surprising, therefore, to find these two

                    ideals –

                    viz, equality before the law and equal protection

                    of the law – enshrined in many other constitutions. these include the

                    fourteenth amendment of the us constitution (“the us fourteenth

                    amendment”) and, in particular, art 14 of the indian constitution,

                    upon which our art 12 is obviously based. article 14 of the indian

                    constitution reads:
the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the

                        equal protection of the laws within the territory of india.
as can be expected, the malaysian constitution, from which our

                    constitution was drawn, has an identical provision in

                art 8(1).
35     the first principle in art 12(1) –

                    viz, equality before the law – comes from

                    english common law, which prohibits special privileges in favour of any

                    individual and mandates the equal subjection of all classes of persons to the

                    law: see albert venn dicey, law of the

                        constitution (macmillan, 10th ed, 1959) at

                    pp 202–203. a person’s social standing, achievements,

                    accolades, wealth, learning and family ties are not distinguishing factors as

                    far as the law and its application are concerned, nor do they entitle a person

                    to any different treatment under the law.
36     the formulation of the second principle in

                    art 12(1) –

                    viz, that all persons are entitled to the equal

                    protection of the law – comes from the us fourteenth amendment, which

                    prescribes that “no state shall … deny to any person within its

                    jurisdiction the equal protection of the

                    laws” [emphasis added]: see durga das basu, commentary on the constitution of india (s c sarkar

                    & sons (p) ltd, 6th ed, 1975) at vol b, p 1. some historical

                    background to this provision would be helpful. the us fourteenth amendment was

                    enacted in 1868, shortly after the end of the american civil war, to counter

                    legislation in the former confederate states which restricted the rights of

                    freed black slaves to own both personal and real property as well as to enter

                    into certain kinds of contracts, and subjected them to harsher criminal

                    penalties than whites. the us fourteenth amendment was necessary to redress this

                    discrimination by making such legislation unconstitutional, and to guarantee the

                    rights of and protect emancipated black slaves who were now also full citizens

                    of the us just like their white counterparts: see tan yock lin, “equal

                    protection, extra-territorialiy and self-incrimination” (1998)

                    19 sing lr 10 (“tan yock lin”)

                    at p 11. thus, in strauder v west virginia

                    100 us 303 (1880), a statute in west virginia which excluded blacks from

                    serving on juries was struck down by the us supreme court as unconstitutional

                    under the us fourteenth amendment and the conviction of a black man by an

                    all-white jury was set aside. the equal protection clause also ensured that

                    other races enjoyed the same civil rights that were enjoyed by whites. in

                        yick wo v hopkins 118 us 356 (1886)

                        (“yick wo”), the us supreme

                    court struck down not the law, which was fair and impartial on its face, but the

                    administrative discriminatory implementation of the law against the chinese, who

                    were refused licences to operate their laundries in wooden buildings in san

                    francisco, whereas many non-chinese secured licences to operate laundries in

                    similar buildings. stanley matthews j, writing for the court, said (at

                    369):
these provisions are universal in their application, to all persons within

                        the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of

                        colour, or of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge

                        of the protection of equal laws.
the court also noted that no reason was given as to why the chinese

                    petitioners in yick wo, along with two hundred

                    other chinese, were denied the right to operate their laundries in wooden

                    buildings, whilst eighty other non-chinese were granted licences to do so. the

                    us supreme court went on to rule (at 374):
the fact of this discrimination is admitted. no reason for it is shown,

                        and the conclusion cannot be resisted, that no reason for it exists except

                        hostility to the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong, and

                        which in the eye of the law is not justified. the discrimination is,

                        therefore, illegal, and the public administration which enforces it

                            is a denial of the equal protection of the laws and a

                            violation of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.

37     professor tan yock lin

                    (“prof tan”) has argued in tan yock

                        lin (at p 11) that initially, the principle of equal

                    protection of the law was restricted to being a guarantee of procedural or

                    administrative equality, but was soon expanded to include a guarantee of

                    substantive equality as well (citing haji harun bin haji

                        idris v public prosecutor [1977] 2 mlj 155 (“datuk

                        haji”)). with respect, i agree.
38     it will be seen that equality before the law

                    and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine

                    – equal justice. the first expresses the immutable principle of equal

                    subjection of all classes of persons to the law, and the second is the positive

                    aspect of that principle which reaches out, when invoked, to strike down unequal

                    laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional

                    and void.
39     in public prosecutor v taw

                        cheng kong [1998] 2 slr(r) 489 (“taw cheng kong (ca)”), the court of appeal (at

                    [52]–[53]) noted the origin of these twin concepts as follows:
52    … this

                            concept is not new, being part of the wider doctrine of the rule of law,

                            and its origin can perhaps be traced all the way back to the

                            40th article of the magna carta:
to none will we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we delay

                            right or justice.
53    as observed by the

                            malaysian court in pp v su liang yu [1976]

                            2 mlj 128 at 129:
the dominant idea in both expressions ‘equal before the

                            law’ and ‘equal protection of the law’ is that of

                            equal justice. the meaning of these two expressions have been decided in

                            a number of decisions of the us supreme court and also the indian

                            supreme courts [sic] …
this correctly encapsulates the origins of the us

                    fourteenth amendment. one of the prime movers of the us fourteenth amendment was

                    congressman john armor bingham of ohio. in one of his speeches to the house of

                    representatives, he emphasised that “equal protection of the laws”

                    stemmed from art 40 of the magna carta: see cong

                        globe, 42nd 1st sess appendix, 83 (1871).
40     it has been well said by dr thio su mien

                    (“dr thio”), a former dean of the nus law faculty and a

                    prominent lawyer, in s m huang-thio, “equal protection and

                    rational classification” [1963] pl 412 (“huang-thio”) (at p 412) that:
… [a] constitution … institutionalises in legal terms the

                        highest aspirations of a people, amongst which is the establishment of an

                        egalitarian society. equalitarianism runs deep in man, and age cannot wither

                        nor custom stale its infinite vitality.
41     herein lies the paradox: it becomes evident

                    the moment one moves from lofty ideals, which have everything to commend them,

                    to practical implementation. as dr thio herself postulates, do

                    “equal laws” connote that all laws must be equal in their

                    application? must all laws apply universally to all persons in all

                    circumstances? dr thio’s self-evident answer (at p 413)

                    is:
clearly this is well-nigh impossible. human beings are not equal by

                        nature, attainment, circumstances and conditions. their needs vary and their

                        problems require separate treatment.
legislatures around the world have to continually classify diverse

                    groups and activities within their society for different purposes and different

                    treatment in areas such as health care, welfare and immigration, just to name a

                    few. this is clearly illustrated in issues like taxation, differences between

                    corporations and individuals, protection of women, young children and the

                    mentally infirm – the list is long. it is implicit from art 12 itself

                    that art 12(1) does not prohibit classification in toto because it is immediately followed by two other clauses,

                    art 12(2) and art 12(3), which set out, respectively, prohibited and

                    permitted kinds of discriminatory classification:
(2)    except as expressly

                            authorised by this constitution, there shall be no discrimination

                            against citizens of singapore on the ground only of religion, race,

                            descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office

                            or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any

                            law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or

                            the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession,

                            vocation or employment.
(3)    this

                            article does not invalidate or prohibit —
(a)    any provision

                                regulating personal law; or
(b)    any provision or

                                practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs

                                of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group professing

                                any religion, to persons professing that religion.
42     the indian supreme court in chiranjit lal v union of india (1950) scr 869 (“chiranjit lal”) acknowledged (at 932):
it is plain that every classification is in some degree likely to produce

                        some inequality.
similarly, in public prosecutor v su liang

                        yu [1976] 2 mlj 128 (“su liang

                        yu”), which was cited by our court of appeal in taw cheng kong (ca) at [53] (see [39] above), the

                    malaysian court said (at 129):
due to the demands caused by the complexity of modern government the

                        doctrine of classification was evolved by the courts for practical purposes

                        and read into the equality provisions. it has been accepted therefore that a

                        legislature for the purpose of dealing with the complex problems arising out

                        of an infinite variety of human relations cannot but proceed upon some sort

                        of selection or classification of persons upon whom the legislation is to

                        operate.
prof tan opines (see tan yock lin

                    at p 12):
another remarkable past phenomenon was the dash of apology attributing the

                        necessity of differentiation to the complexity of modern laws, expressed by

                        frankfurther j in these terms: “the more complicated society

                        becomes, the greater the diversity of problems and the more does legislation

                        direct itself to the diversities” [citing morey v

                            daud 354 us 457 at 472 (1957)]. again, from our distance

                        of time, a more enlightened and encompassing view is much to be preferred:

                        that differentiation is the essence of law. no law is, nor can be, free from

                        it; for the law represents the authority to divide and dispose of, and thus

                        differentiate in, a nation’s resources, its past, present and future

                        burdens and privileges.
our anxiety to secure equal protection particularly in reformative

                        legislation explains why we have overlooked this fact that all law, written

                        or unwritten, differentiates.
43     in taw cheng kong

                        (ca), the court of appeal cited (at [57]) with approval the

                    following passage from the judgment of salleh abas lp (which, although a

                    dissenting judgment, was not disputed in terms of the law applied and the

                    approach taken) in malaysian bar v government of

                        malaysia [1987] 2 mlj 165 (“malaysian bar”) at 166–167:
the requirement for equal protection of the law does not mean that all

                        laws passed by a legislature must apply universally to all persons and that

                        the laws so passed cannot create differences as to the persons to whom they

                        apply and the territorial limits within which they are in force. individuals

                        in any society differ in many respects such as, inter

                            alia, age, ability, education, height, size, colour, wealth,

                        occupation, race and religion. any law made by a

                            legislature must of necessity involve the making of a choice and

                            differences as regards its applications in terms of persons, time and

                            territory. since the legislature can create differences, the question is

                            whether these differences are constitutional. the answer is this: if the

                            basis of the difference has a reasonable connection with the object of

                            the impugned legislation, the difference and therefore the law which

                            contains such provision is constitutional and valid. if on the other

                            hand there is no such relationship the difference is stigmatized as

                            discriminatory and the impugned legislation is therefore

                            unconstitutional and invalid. this is known as the doctrine

                        of classification which has been judicially accepted as an integral part of

                        the equal protection clause. [emphasis in original]
44     it is therefore clear and important to note

                    that parliament, in dealing with the issues arising within and without the

                    country, is entitled to pass laws that deal with, inter

                        alia, the myriad of problems that arise from the inherent

                    inequality and differences pervading society. in so dealing with specific

                    problems and specific groups of people, it is inevitable that classification

                    will produce inequality of varying degrees. it is now settled law that equality

                    before the law and equal protection of the law under art 12(1) does not

                    mean that all persons are to be treated equally, but that all persons in like

                    situations are to be treated alike: see, eg,

                        taw cheng kong (ca) and ong

                        ah chuan and another v public prosecutor [1979–1980] slr(r)

                    710 (“ong ah chuan”).
the “reasonable classification” test
45     the test for constitutionality under

                    art 12(1) has been termed the “reasonable classification”

                    test (see nguyen tuong van v public prosecutor

                    [2005] 1 slr(r) 103 (“nguyen”)

                    at [70] and yong vui kong v public prosecutor and another

                        matter [2010] 3 slr 489 (“yong vui

                        kong”) at [111]). this test is well established in the

                    common law. the court of appeal in taw cheng kong

                        (ca) distilled the “reasonable classification” test

                    from the privy council decision of ong ah chuan at

                    [37], the indian supreme court cases of ram krishna

                        dalmia and ghulam sarwar v union of

                        india [1967] 2 scr 271, and the malaysian cases of datuk haji and government of malaysia

                        v vr menon [1990] 1 mlj 277. it also cited with

                    approval two of the three judgments delivered in malaysian

                        bar, namely, the judgment of salleh abas lp (see [43] above)

                    and that of mohamed azmi scj (see malaysian

                        bar at 170), quoting (inter alia)

                    the following extract from the latter judgment (see taw cheng

                        kong (ca) at [58]):
…
(b)    discriminatory law

                            is good law if it is based on ‘reasonable’ or

                            ‘permissible’ classification, provided that
(i)    the classification is founded on an

                                intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons that are

                                grouped together from others left out of the group;

                            and
(ii)   the differentia has a rational relation to

                                the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. the

                                classification may be founded on different bases such as

                                geographical, or according to objects or occupations and the like.

                                what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of

                                classification and the object of the law in question.
46     this test is the same as the two-step

                        tan eng hong test set out at [18] above, which

                    is binding upon me. in accordance with that test, where the impugned legislation

                    has a differentiating measure, that legislation will only be consistent with

                    art 12(1) if:
(a)     the classification prescribed by the

                        legislation is founded on an intelligible differentia (“the first

                        limb”); and
(b)     the differentia bears a rational relation to the object sought to be

                        achieved by that legislation (“the second

                    limb”).
the first limb – intelligible differentia
47     the first limb requires that the

                    classification prescribed by the impugned legislation must be based on an

                    intelligible differentia. “intelligible” means something that may

                    be understood or is capable of being apprehended by the intellect or

                    understanding, as opposed to by the senses. “differentia” is used

                    in the sense of a distinguishing mark or character, some attribute or feature by

                    which one is distinguished from all others. scientifically, one talks of an

                    attribute by which a species is distinguished from all other species of the same

                    genus.
48     applying this to the present case, it is quite

                    clear that the classification prescribed by s 377a –

                    viz, male homosexuals or bisexual males who

                    perform acts of “gross indecency” on another male – is based

                    on an intelligible differentia. it is also clear from the differentia in

                    s 377a that the section excludes male-female acts and female-female acts.

                    there is little difficulty identifying who falls within this classification and

                    who does not. the court of appeal seemed to say as much in tan eng hong at [125]–[126]. in my view, the first limb is

                    satisfied and few can cavil with this conclusion.
the second limb – rational relation to the object of the

                legislation
49     the second limb requires an ascertainment of

                    the object or purpose of the statutory provision in question followed by a

                    determination of whether the differentia underlying the classification

                    prescribed by that legislation bears a rational relation to the object or

                    purpose of the provision. both these elements are more complex than they

                    appear.
50     determining the purpose or object of a piece

                    of legislation is not always a straightforward task, for example:
(a)     what if the legislation in question

                        or the legislature is silent on the purpose or object of the legislation? do

                        we frame the purpose or object generally with regard to all the provisions

                        of the legislation, or do we only take the section or group of sections

                        which we are concerned with?
(b)     there is sometimes a general statement explaining the

                        need for an act when it is first introduced in parliament, but does that

                        general statement always apply to the many individual and varying statutory

                        provisions within the act, which may be quite specific in their application

                        and effect? the current penal code, with over 500 sections, is a prime

                        example.
(c)     if the

                        legislation in question was added as an amendment, and in introducing the

                        amendment, there was no or insufficient articulation of the purpose or

                        object of that amendment, what purpose or object is to be ascribed to it?

                        should it be its own purpose or object as ascertained by the court, or the

                        original purpose or object of the statute within which it appears when that

                        statute was first introduced in parliament?
(d)     is the purpose or object of a piece of

                        legislation to be framed narrowly and/or simply, or widely and therefore

                        more vaguely? as we shall see below from the high court’s judgment in

                            taw cheng kong v public prosecutor [1998]

                        1 slr(r) 78 (“taw cheng kong

                        (hc)”) and the court of appeal’s judgment in

                            taw cheng kong (ca), how the purpose of a

                        piece of legislation is framed does make a difference when ascertaining

                        whether there is a rational relation between the differentia underlying the

                        classification prescribed by that legislation and the purpose of that

                        legislation.
(e)     what if, as here, the provision in question started out as a provision

                        enacted in england in 1885, and was later introduced into singapore in 1938?

                        assuming the purpose of the provision was expressed when it was enacted in

                        england, do we take that original english purpose or the purpose for which

                        the provision was introduced into singapore in 1938? more generally, in

                        determining the purpose or object of a local statutory provision, can we

                        look at the parliamentary records of the country or countries from which the

                        provision originated?
(f)     what if additionally, as in this case, substantial amendments to the

                        1985 penal code were tabled before parliament in october 2007 but not on

                        s 377a, although there were debates (ie,

                        the october 2007 parliamentary debates (see [29] above)) on the continued

                        retention of that section as well as a call for its repeal because of a

                        petition submitted by a nominated member of parliament

                        (“nmp”), and no vote was ultimately taken on its possible

                        repeal: do we ascertain or identify the object or purpose of s 377a

                        based on the october 2007 parliamentary debates? what if there are

                        differences between the purpose of s 377a as stated in 1938 when this

                        provision was first introduced into our penal legislation and the purpose as

                        stated during the october 2007 parliamentary debates: which purpose or

                        purposes are to be adopted?
(g)     what if the original purpose or object of the legislation

                        in question is no longer valid or has ceased to exist, but there is a new

                        and valid purpose or object which the legislation fulfils: are we permitted

                        to substitute the new purpose or object to ascertain whether the differentia

                        underlying the classification prescribed by that legislation bears a

                        rational relation to this new purpose or object?
51     when we come to the “rational

                    relation” element, we can also face some very daunting issues. for

                    instance:
(a)     if the courts are able to ascertain

                        a more efficient or different classification which will better achieve the

                        purpose or object of the legislation concerned, can the courts then strike

                        down the legislation on the basis that the differentia underlying the

                        classification prescribed therein lacks a rational relation with the purpose

                        or object of that legislation?
(b)     what if there is significant under-classification

                            (eg, the object or purpose of the

                        legislation covers five different groups in society, but the legislation

                        only singles out and affects one of the five groups): does that point to the

                        non-existence of a rational relation between the differentia underlying the

                        classification prescribed by the legislation and the purpose or object of

                        that legislation?
(c)     what if there is significant over-classification (eg, the object or purpose of the legislation covers two

                        groups in society, but the legislation affects not only those two groups but

                        five other groups as well): does that likewise point to the non-existence of

                        a rational relation between the differentia underlying the classification

                        prescribed by the legislation and the purpose or object of that

                        legislation?
(1)   the difficulties of applying the second limb: taw cheng kong (hc) and taw cheng kong

                    (ca)
52     some of the complexities in applying the

                    second limb can be illustrated by a comparison of the respective approaches

                    taken in taw cheng kong (hc) and taw cheng kong (ca). in the discussion which follows (at

                    [53]–[61] below), only the relevant aspects of these two decisions in

                    relation to art 12 will be considered, with the other issues raised

                        (eg, the ultra

                        vires doctrine and the admissibility or inconsistency of

                    evidence) being put to one side.
53     the accused in taw cheng

                        kong (hc), a singapore citizen, was a regional manager of the

                    government of singapore investment corporation (“gic”) based in

                    hong kong. he was in charge of gic’s equity portfolios in hong kong and

                    the philippines, and had the authority to decide which companies gic would

                    invest in, with about s$1 billion at his disposal. he was convicted by a

                    district court of corruption for receiving from one kevin lee, a managing

                    director of rockefeller’s far east operations, various sums of money each

                    time gic invested in a pioneer hong kong fund managed by rockefeller and an

                    “incentive fee” each time he caused gic to purchase shares in

                    certain companies. the accused’s conviction was based on

                        s 6(a) of the prevention of corruption

                    act (cap 241, 1993 rev ed) (“the pca”), read together

                    with s 37(1) thereof, which provides as follows:
the provisions of this act have effect, in relation to citizens of

                        singapore, outside as well as within singapore; and where an offence under

                        this act is committed by a citizen of singapore in any place outside

                        singapore, he may be dealt with in respect of that offence as if it had been

                        committed within singapore.
54     one of the grounds which the accused relied

                    upon in his appeal to the high court against his conviction and sentence by the

                    district court was that s 37(1) of the pca discriminated against him as a

                    singapore citizen and violated his rights under art 12(1). he contended

                    that the criterion of citizenship in s 37(1) of the pca was arbitrary and

                    discriminatory, in that if a non-citizen or a singapore permanent resident,

                    together with a singapore citizen, jointly committed an offence under the pca

                    abroad, only the singapore citizen could be dealt with and charged, but not the

                    non-citizen or the singapore permanent resident.
55     m karthigesu ja, sitting as a high

                    court judge on the accused’s appeal, found that s 37(1) of the pca

                    was discriminatory and violated the accused’s rights under art 12(1).

                    he therefore held s 37(1) of the pca to be unconstitutional, allowed the

                    accused’s appeal and set aside his conviction and sentence. in dealing

                    with the second limb (viz, whether the differentia

                    of citizenship adopted in s 37(1) of the pca bore a reasonable relation or

                    rational nexus to the object of that act), karthigesu ja ruled:
(a)     according to the relevant

                        parliamentary debates, the pca was originally enacted in 1960 (as the

                        prevention of corruption ordinance 1960 (no 39 of 1960) (“the

                        original pca”)) to eradicate corruption from singapore’s civil

                        service (“the singapore civil service”) and among fiduciaries

                        in singapore, and not corruption globally irrespective of national

                        boundaries.
(b)     section 37(1) of the pca was not part of the original pca and was

                        added by an amendment in 1966. it was incorrect, as a matter of statutory

                        interpretation, to “rely on earlier material to interpret subsequent

                        legislation as if the subsequent legislation was tailored from a

                        retrospective standpoint … to fit seamlessly into the schematics of

                        the original act” (see taw cheng kong

                            (hc) at [40]), and it was important to look at the amending

                        legislation afresh.
(c)     from the parliamentary material relating to the enactment of the

                        original pca in 1960 and the subsequent addition of s 37(1), it could

                        be seen that s 37(1) was added to address acts of corruption taking

                        place outside singapore but affecting events within

                    singapore.
(d)     therefore, classification along the lines of citizenship was an

                        unreasonable means of attaining the objective of s 37(1) of the pca for

                        it was both over-inclusive and under-inclusive:
(i)       it was over-inclusive as it

                            included a class of persons not originally contemplated as falling

                            within the objective of the pca: eg, a

                            singapore citizen who was now a permanent resident of and employed in a

                            foreign country, and who received a bribe in a foreign currency from a

                            foreign payor for an act to be done in that foreign country and not

                            singapore. such a person would be guilty of a corruption offence because

                            of s 37(1) of the pca.
(ii)       it was under-inclusive as it failed to include

                            a class of persons who clearly fell within the mischief sought to be

                            addressed by the pca: eg, a singapore

                            permanent resident or a foreigner working in the singapore civil service

                            who took a trip outside singapore to receive a bribe in singapore

                            dollars in relation to an act which he was do in singapore. such a

                            person would not be caught by s 37(1) of the

                    pca.
(e)     the

                        singapore permanent resident or foreigner in scenario (d)(ii) above

                        posed a greater threat to the integrity of the singapore civil service than

                        the singapore citizen employed abroad in scenario (d)(i) above, but

                        only the latter, and not the former, was caught by s 37(1) of the

                        pca.
(f)     the

                        strength of the nexus or relation between the objective of the pca and the

                        differentia underlying the classification prescribed therein (viz, the differentia of citizenship) was

                        insufficient to justify the derogation from the constitutional guarantee of

                        equality in art 12(1).
56     as pointed out by prof tan in tan yock lin (at pp 15–16),

                    karthigesu ja’s narrow framing of the object or purpose of the pca

                    was decisive. karthigesu ja tied the objective of the pca back to

                    singapore, ie, the object of the pca was to

                    eradicate corruption which infringed on the efficient running of the singapore

                    civil service and stem out corrupt practices amongst fiduciaries in singapore. since s 37(1) of the pca was added to

                    address acts of corruption taking place outside singapore but affecting events

                        within singapore, that made the differentia

                    employed –

                    viz, that of citizenship – more vulnerable

                    to failing to achieve the purpose.
57     following the accused’s acquittal by the

                    high court in taw cheng kong (hc), the

                    attorney-general brought a criminal reference on questions of law under

                    s 60 of the supreme court of judicature act (cap 322, 1985 rev

                    ed). one of these questions was whether s 37(1) of the pca was

                    discriminatory against singapore citizens and, hence, inconsistent with

                    art 12(1). the court of appeal considered the concept of equality and the

                    tests for determining whether a statute or an executive act violated

                    art 12, applied those tests to s 37(1) of the pca and answered this

                    question in the negative. in dealing with the issues surrounding the object of

                    the pca and the application of the “rational relation”

                    requirement, the following points made by the court of appeal (at

                    [60]–[88] of taw cheng kong (ca)) are

                    germane:
(a)     without commenting on

                        karthigesu ja’s approach to statutory interpretation in

                        ascertaining the purpose or object of the pca and of the later enactment of

                        s 37(1) of the pca (see [55(b)]–[55(c)] above), the court of

                        appeal looked at the preamble to the pca, which reads: “[a]n act to

                        provide for the more effectual prevention of corruption”, and framed

                        the purpose of s 37(1) of the pca quite differently and broadly (see

                            taw cheng kong (ca) at [63]):
we thought it obvious that the 1966 introduction of the

                            extra-territorial clause in [s 37(1)] was, inter

                                alia, to widen the ambit of the act [ie, the original pca] for the more effective control and

                            suppression of corruption.
(a)     thus

                        formulated, s 37(1) of the pca was capable of capturing all corrupt

                        acts by singapore citizens outside singapore while still falling within the

                        broad purpose of controlling and suppressing corruption.
(b)     the removal from the objective of the

                        pca of any reference to acts of corruption which had a demonstrable effect

                        in singapore made it immediately easier to justify the constitutionality of

                        the differentia prescribed in s 37(1) of the pca.
(c)     the court of appeal also dismissed the

                        notion that the under-inclusiveness or over-inclusiveness of s 37(1) of

                        the pca meant that it was unconstitutional:
(i)       in the case of

                            under-inclusiveness, parliament had to respect international comity,

                            which made it impractical to extend s 37(1) of the pca to

                            non-citizens outside of singapore.
(ii)       in the case of over-inclusiveness

                                (viz, a singapore citizen who was a

                            foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country and who

                            received a bribe paid in foreign currency by a foreign payor for an act

                            to be done in that foreign country), it was irrelevant to the

                            constitutional issue of equality because s 37(1) of the pca applied

                            to all singapore citizens as a class.
(b)     the court of appeal said (at [82] of

                            taw cheng kong (ca)):
… [i]f the differentiation along the line of citizenship was

                            justified and permissible, as we so held, over-inclusiveness was

                            irrelevant to the constitutional issue. section 37(1) was only

                            over-inclusive because, as the learned judge found, it captured that

                            segment of singapore citizens not contemplated by the [pca]. but, this

                            would not offend the equality provision because the section would apply

                            to all singapore citizens as a class. it

                            followed then that the objection to classification between citizens and

                            non-citizens on the basis of over-inclusiveness did not arise at all.

                            [emphasis in original]
(d)     the court of

                        appeal (at [81] of taw cheng kong (ca))

                        accepted that even if s 37(1) of the pca was under-inclusive, in that

                        it failed to capture non-citizens whose corrupt acts outside singapore had

                        consequences in singapore, the overriding need to observe international

                        comity made it impractical to extend s 37(1) of the pca to capture

                        non-citizens whose corrupt acts outside singapore had consequences in

                        singapore. the court of appeal also held that it was undeniable that

                        s 37(1) of the pca would go some way toward capturing the corrupt acts

                        of singapore citizens abroad and that, itself, furthered the object of the

                        pca. it said (likewise at [81]):
… [s]urely it was undeniable that s 37(1) would go some

                            way in capturing the corrupt acts of citizens abroad, and that in itself

                            would have furthered the object of the [pca] – that in our view

                            was sufficient; the under-inclusiveness of the provision was not fatal.

                            the enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover

                            every contingency. such a demand would be legislatively impractical, if

                            not impossible.
(e)     the court of

                        appeal found that it was not unreasonable or irrational for s 37(1) of

                        the pca not to apply to the corrupt activities of singapore permanent

                        residents and non-citizens which took place outside

                singapore.
58     prof tan has made a number of comments on

                        taw cheng kong (ca) in tan

                        yock lin (at pp 15–16). the first relates to the

                    importance of the proper framing of the object or purpose of the impugned

                    legislation. if the true purpose of s 37(1) of the pca and the pca itself

                    is not to deter the causing of harmful effects in

                    singapore from corruption but to deter the participation of singaporeans in corruption, then the objection of

                    over-inclusiveness (based on the example of the singapore citizen who lives

                    abroad and commits a corrupt act abroad which has no effect in singapore)

                    disappears because it falls within the aforesaid re-framed purpose.

                    prof tan has also made the following comments (see tan

                        yock lin at pp 18–19):
(a)     the court of appeal was wrong in

                        dismissing over-inclusiveness as irrelevant on the ground that s 37(1)

                        of the pca applied to all singapore citizens. in other words, it was

                        incorrect of the court of appeal to say that since there was equality within

                        the class targeted by s 37(1) of the pca, the provision was fair, and

                        the differentiation permissible. prof tan comments that this amounts to

                        a tautology and, therefore, no classification would ever be over- or

                        under-inclusive:
this syllogistic dismissal of the objection of overinclusiveness

                            betrays its premises, since it amounts to an argument that class

                            fairness is a tautology and on this account, nothing that is

                            overinclusive or underinclusive can ever be recognised. but in the first

                            place, the willingness to test for inclusiveness predicates the

                            rejection of a tautologous conception of class fairness. a convincing

                            answer must therefore be found outside the expression brandished in

                                ong ah chuan v pp.
(b)     if the

                        under-inclusiveness of s 37(1) of the pca is justified purely on the

                        basis of international comity, then whilst this might explain why the

                        citizenship criterion is sound, there would be a glaring under-inclusion in

                        the case of the singapore permanent resident. in prof tan’s

                        view:
the under-inclusion of the permanent resident seems, however, to have

                            been ignored in both courts principally because the arguments focused on

                            the supposed ideal effects criterion, contrasting the nationality

                            criterion with it. but if considerations of international comity explain

                            why the nationality criterion is sound, the omission of the permanent

                            resident becomes a glaring omission. he seems to go with the citizen as

                            wood goes with fire. would there not be a serious under-inclusion in his

                            omission?
59     with the greatest respect, and with due

                    deference to the court of appeal in taw cheng kong

                        (ca), prof tan does make some valid points, the most

                    important of which, in my view, is his criticism of the use of tautological

                    reasoning in deciding whether or not a classification is constitutionally

                    permissible. in this same regard, prof tan raised the privy council case of

                        ong ah chuan as another example of

                    tautological reasoning. the question posed to the privy council in that case (at

                    [32]) was whether it was inconsistent with art 12(1) to impose a mandatory

                    death penalty on an offender who “gratuitously supplied an addict friend

                    with 15g of heroin from his own private store, and to inflict a lesser

                    punishment upon a professional dealer caught selling for distribution to many

                    addicts a total of 14.99g”. in answering this question, lord diplock

                    made a number of important observations (at [33] and [35]–[37]):
33    their lordships would emphasise that in their

                            judicial capacity they are in no way concerned with arguments for or

                            against capital punishment or its efficacy as a deterrent to so evil and

                            profitable a crime as trafficking in addictive drugs. whether there should be capital punishment in singapore and if so,

                                for what offences are questions for the legislature of

                                singapore. …
…
35    … equality before the law and equal

                            protection of the law require that like should be compared with like.

                            what art 12(1) of the constitution assures to the individual is the

                            right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar

                            circumstances. it prohibits laws which

                            require that some individuals within

                                a single class should be

                            treated by way of punishment more harshly than others; it does not

                            forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between

                                one class of individuals and another

                                class in relation to which there is some difference in

                            the circumstances of the offence that has been committed.
36    the discrimination that the appellants challenge in

                            the instant cases is discrimination between class and class: the

                            imposition of a capital penalty upon that class of individuals who

                            traffic in 15g of heroin or more and the imposition of a penalty, severe

                            though it may be, which is not capital upon that class of individuals

                            who traffic in less than 15g of heroin. the dissimilarity in

                            circumstances between the two classes of

                            individuals lies in the quantity of the drug that was involved in the

                            offence.
37    the questions whether this dissimilarity in

                            circumstances justifies any differentiation in the punishments imposed

                            upon individuals who fall within one class and those

                                who fall within the other, and, if so, what are the

                            appropriate punishments for each class, are questions

                                of social policy. under the constitution, which is based

                            on the separation of powers, these are questions which it is the

                            function of the legislature to decide, not that of the judiciary.

                                provided that the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not

                                purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the social

                                object of the law, there is no inconsistency with

                            art 12(1) of the constitution.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
60     lord diplock’s judgment presents

                    two clear strands of principles. the first strand concerns differentiation

                    within the same class, which is always prohibited; the second concerns

                    differentiation between two or more different classes, which is permissible if

                    it passes the “reasonable classification” test. if we apply

                    prof tan’s reasoning, it will be seen that this is, in effect, a

                    possibly illusory distinction. although lord diplock appears to have

                    distilled two categories of cases, there is in fact only one category governed

                    by the fundamental rule that “like should be treated alike”. this

                    is because within lord diplock’s first category of differentiation

                        (ie, differentiation within one single class),

                    it is more often than not conceptually possible to break down the single class

                    into smaller classes, thereby creating two or more classes. for example,

                    returning to taw cheng kong (hc) and taw cheng kong (ca), singapore citizens, singapore

                    permanent residents and foreigners living in singapore can all perform corrupt

                    acts which adversely affect the singapore civil service and/or fiduciaries in

                    singapore. we can create one class with all three groups within it on the basis

                    that their corrupt acts adversely affect the singapore civil service and/or

                    fiduciaries in singapore. in such an event, we cannot discriminate within that

                    one big class. but, we can also create two classes out of the three groups: one

                    class that resides here, and another class that resides outside singapore but

                    performs corrupt acts which affect singapore. it would then be acceptable to

                    discriminate against one class because such discrimination would be across

                    classes, but we are, in effect, discriminating against some of these people but

                    not others when they were previously grouped as one big class. the same

                    tautology is seen if we classify these persons into three classes –

                    viz, singapore citizens, singapore permanent

                    residents and foreigners living in singapore – in which case, it is again

                    permissible to discriminate against a particular class. similarly, we can

                    classify these same persons into six groups: from each of the three groups

                        (viz, singapore citizens, singapore permanent

                    residents and foreigners living in singapore), we can divide them further into

                    those that do acts which affect singapore, and those that do not. we can divide

                    them further into twelve groups if we add in the factor of where the

                    gratification was accepted or where the bribe was made, ie, whether in singapore or overseas.
61     the way to avoid this tautology is to be less

                    fixated with the idea of classes, and more focused

                    on the fundamental rubric that “like should be treated alike”. in

                    determining whether like persons are being treated alike, the inquiry has to be

                    informed by the purpose of the legislation in question and its connection to the

                    differentia underlying the classification prescribed by the challenged

                    legislation. speaking in the abstract of permissible discrimination between classes and impermissible discrimination

                        within a class is not helpful.
62     bearing in mind the above, i now examine the

                    object of s 377a and the issue of whether there is a rational relation

                    between that object and the differentia underlying the classification prescribed

                    by s 377a. i begin with the former.
(2)   what is the object of s 377a?
(a)   the labouchere amendment
63     the court of appeal in tan

                        eng hong has (at [23]–[33]) comprehensively set out the

                    legislative history of s 377 and s 377a, and there is no need to

                    repeat the same, save to refer to it where relevant. the wording of s 377a

                    comes from the amendment commonly known in england as “the labouchere

                    amendment” (see tan eng hong at [26]),

                    which was introduced into english criminal law via s 11 of the criminal law

                    amendment act 1885 (c 69) (uk) (“the uk 1885 act”). the

                    proposer of this amendment, mr henry labouchere

                    (“mr labouchere”), was described as a radical liberal party

                    member of parliament (“mp”) and a banking heir who had put his

                    money and energies into a radical, muck-raking newspaper called

                    “truth”. he advocated, inter alia,

                    the abolition of the house of lords and an end to racism, and championed the

                    working classes, women and the dispossessed: see douglas e sanders,

                    “377 and the unnatural afterlife of british colonialism in asia”

                    (2009) 4 asian journal of comparative law 163 at p 176. the preamble to the

                    uk 1885 act stated that it was an act to make further provision for, inter alia, the protection of women and girls and the

                    suppression of brothels. section 11 of that act specifically focused on

                    sexual conduct, both in public and in private, between male homosexuals and was

                    thus not quite related to the preamble. the reasons for the enactment of the

                    labouchere amendment are now a little obscure. francis barrymore smith

                    (“smith”), in his article “labouchere’s amendment to

                    the criminal law amendment bill” (1976) 17 historical studies 165

                        (“f b smith”), states

                    that: “[t]he question [of why the labouchere amendment was enacted] can

                    never be settled convincingly. mr labouchere’s personal papers mostly

                    seem to have been destroyed and the few that are known have no bearing on this

                    episode.” at paras 106–108 of the united kingdom report of the

                    departmental committee on homosexual offences and prostitution (cmnd 247,

                    1957) (“the wolfenden report”), the additional points

                    emerge:
(a)     buggery and attempted buggery,

                        wherever and with whomsoever committed, have long been criminal offences in

                        the uk. these acts are criminal offences regardless of whether they are

                        committed in public or in private and whether they are committed between

                        consenting parties or non-consenting parties.
(b)     the labouchere amendment was introduced in the

                        late stages of a bill to make further provision for, inter alia, the protection of women and girls and the

                        suppression of brothels (“the 1885 bill”). specifically, this

                        amendment was introduced in the house of commons at the report stage of the

                        1885 bill (ie, the 1885 bill had already been

                        passed by the house of lords, where it had been introduced without any

                        reference to “gross indecency” between males).

                        mr labouchere’s reasons for introducing the amendment were

                        recorded as follows (see daily debates

                            (6 august 1885) at

                        col 1397):
… [a]t present any person on whom an assault of the kind here

                            dealt with was committed must be under the age of 13, and the object

                            with which [mr labouchere] had brought forward this clause was to

                            make the law applicable to any person whether under the age of 13 or

                            over that age …
(c)     the labouchere

                        amendment was passed by the house of commons without any discussion on its

                        substance, the only question raised being whether it was in order to move an

                        amendment that dealt with a class of offence totally different from the

                        offences contemplated by the 1885 bill, which had already been read for the

                        second time in the house of commons.
(d)     the speaker of the house of commons ruled that anything

                        could be introduced by the leave of the house, and the labouchere amendment

                        was adopted.
(e)     the clause which became s 11 of the uk 1885 act went much wider than

                        mr labouchere’s stated intention as set out at sub-para (b)

                        above, and it seems probable that the uk parliament let it pass without the

                        detailed consideration which such an amendment would almost certainly

                        receive today.
(f)     lastly, s 11 of the uk 1885 act read as follows:

any male person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the

                            commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by

                                any male person of, any act of gross

                            indecency with another male person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour,

                            and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the

                            court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or

                            without hard labour. [emphasis added]
it appears that the original intent behind s 11 of the

                    uk 1885 act was to protect any person from an indecent assault “of the

                    kind here dealt with”, regardless of whether that person was below or

                    above 13 years of age and whether the act in question was committed in public or

                    in private. it was not specifically directed at criminalising male homosexual

                    conduct. however, what was eventually passed into law was something different

                    and more far-reaching as it made acts of “gross indecency” between

                    males, whether in public or in private and whether or not there was consent, an

                    offence.
64     although the purpose of the labouchere

                    amendment and the history of its passage into the statute books may remain

                    obscure, the implementation or enforcement of the resulting legislative

                    provision – s 11 of the uk 1885 act – did not. oscar wilde was

                    one of those prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to two years’

                    imprisonment with hard labour under that provision in 1895. in convicting him

                    and imposing the maximum sentence on him, the trial judge, wills j, said

                    that the maximum sentence allowed was “totally inadequate for a case such

                    as this”, and that the case was “the worst case i have ever

                    tried”: see f b smith at

                    p 171; see also “sentencing statement of justice wills”

                    <http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/sentence.html>

                    (accessed 29 march 2013). what we do know of victorian society at the time

                    of oscar wilde’s trial is that society felt it a great depravity and

                    immorality to have men like oscar wilde in society seducing young boys and men

                    into leading their way of life, and felt that this kind of conduct deserved the

                    clearest condemnation. smith (in f b smith at p 165) writes that “within

                    the decade there developed in the british public a rabid

                        detestation of male homosexuality” [emphasis

                    added].
65     what can be gleaned today, almost 130 years

                    later, is that mr labouchere wanted to introduce legislation to protect

                    persons above the age of 13 (as the existing law already protected those below

                    13) from assaults of the kind dealt with by the labouchere amendment, even

                    though this proposed amendment did not quite fall within the main purposes of

                    the 1885 bill. although the reason given by mr labouchere appeared

                    gender-neutral, the provision that was passed clearly targeted homosexual males

                    and applied to acts of “gross indecency” between males, whether in

                    public or in private and whether or not there was consent. it must also be

                    remembered in context that in the uk, it was only in 1861 (via s 61 of the

                    offences against the person act 1861 (c 100) (uk) (“the uk 1861

                    act”)) that the death penalty for the offence of buggery was replaced

                    with life imprisonment. further, it may well be that the phrase used by

                    mr labouchere –

                    viz, “assault[s] of the kind dealt

                    with” – referred to sexual acts committed by male

                    homosexuals.
(b)   the penal code (amendment) ordinance 1938 (no 12 of

                1938)
66     whilst s 11 of the uk 1885 act was not

                    imported into the indian penal code 1860 (act no 45 of 1860) (“the

                    ipc”), from which our penal code is derived, it found its way into many

                    of the former british colonies, including singapore, hong kong, malaysia,

                    gibraltar and australia (see also the equivalent provisions in kenya, malawi,

                    zambia, jamaica, kiribati, nauru and tuvalu), where some of the corresponding

                    provisions survive to this day. in singapore, s 11 of the uk 1885 act was

                    introduced into the penal code (cap 20, 1936 rev ed) (“the 1936

                    penal code”) by the penal code (amendment) ordinance 1938 (no 12 of

                    1938) (“the howell amendment”). as set out in tan eng hong at [27], the then attorney-general,

                    mr c g howell (“ag howell”), made the

                    following statements in the legislative council on the introduction of the

                    howell amendment (see proceedings of the legislative council

                        of the straits settlements (13 june 1938) at

                    p b49):
with regard to clause 4 it is unfortunately the

                            case that acts of the nature described have been brought to

                            notice. as the law now stands, such acts can only be dealt

                        with, if at all, under the minor offences ordinance, and then only if committed in public. punishment under the

                        ordinance is inadequate and the chances of detection are

                            small. it is desired, therefore, to strengthen the law and to

                        bring it into line with the english criminal law, from which this clause is

                        taken, and the law of various other parts of the colonial empire of which it

                        is only necessary to mention hong kong and gibraltar where conditions are

                        somewhat similar to our own. [emphasis added]
67     from this short address, it can be seen that

                    the reasons given for the introduction of the howell amendment were as

                    follows:
(a)     it was “unfortunately the

                        case” –

                        ie, it was a regrettable state of affairs or a

                        misfortune or an undesirable thing or state of affairs – that males

                        were engaged in grossly indecent acts with other males;
(b)     such acts had been brought to

                        notice;
(c)     at that

                        time, such acts could be dealt with by the law only if they were committed

                        in public;
(d)     the

                        chances of detecting such acts were small; and
(e)     it was desirable to strengthen singapore’s

                        criminal law and bring it in line with english criminal law as well as the

                        criminal law of other british colonies.
the purpose of

                    s 377a’s enactment was therefore clear. the act of males engaging in

                    grossly indecent acts with other males was to be criminalised. the prevalence of

                    such acts was a regrettable state of affairs and was not desirable. it was

                    necessary to strengthen the criminal law and enable it to prosecute males

                    engaging in such grossly indecent acts even if the acts were committed in

                    private. this was because the then prevailing law made it difficult to detect

                    and prosecute such acts.
68     in today’s context, three things are

                    notable about the howell amendment:
(a)     the proposed new section would only

                        apply to grossly indecent acts between males. females were not included or

                        targeted.
(b)     at

                        the time when the howell amendment was enacted by the legislative council in

                        1938, singapore had no constitution as such nor any provisions relating to

                        fundamental liberties. (in 1938, the governor of the straits settlements

                        (“the governor”), sir shenton thomas, ruled the colony of

                        singapore as part of the straits settlements under letters patent with the

                        assistance of the executive council and the legislative council. the

                        legislative council was, in a sense, entrusted with the law-making powers of

                        the straits settlements. it was composed of members of the executive

                        council, the chief justice and representatives appointed by the governor,

                        with the governor having the power of assent and the right of veto in

                        respect of all proposed legislation: see essays in

                            singapore legal history (kevin y l tan gen ed)

                        (marshall cavendish academic, singapore academy of law, 2005) at

                        pp 37–40.)
(c)     the proposed new section would apply even to grossly indecent acts

                        between males done in private.
69     as i mentioned earlier, the original purpose

                    of s 11 of the uk 1885 act, from which our s 377a is derived, was

                    admittedly a little hazy and appears to have changed from its original intention

                    to become a more wide-reaching provision. however, by 1938, when s 11 of

                    the uk 1885 act was adopted locally as s 377a of the 1936 penal code, the

                    purpose of the provision, although laconically expressed, was quite clear. acts

                    of “gross indecency” between males, whether in private or in

                    public and whether or not there was consent, constituted criminal behaviour, and

                    it was a criminal offence to indulge in such acts.
70     in my judgment, the purpose or object of

                    s 377a is that articulated by ag howell in 1938 when he spoke in the

                    legislative council and introduced the provision which later became s 377a

                    (see [66]–[67] above). in ascertaining the purpose or object of a

                    statutory provision, if such purpose or object is not already clear from the

                    provision itself (which is not the case here), then in accordance with s 9a

                    of the interpretation act (cap 1, 2002 rev ed) (“the

                    interpretation act”), we may look to any explanatory statement in the

                    bill introducing the provision or to the speech made in parliament at the second

                    reading of that bill. these must be the primary guideposts. the purpose of an

                    earlier precursor of the statutory provision, especially if that precursor is a

                    statute or subsidiary legislation from another jurisdiction, is but a secondary

                    guidepost at best, referable for context or for elucidation when the primary

                    guideposts are silent or unclear. such secondary guideposts must be used with

                    extreme caution. for instance, the labouchere amendment was introduced in the uk

                    in 1885 and more than 50 years passed before s 377a was introduced into the

                    1936 penal code in singapore. english society and norms in 1885 must have been

                    vastly different from those prevailing in singapore in 1938. furthermore, our

                    penal code originates from india, and not england. in this regard,

                    karthigesu ja’s warning in taw cheng kong

                        (hc) –

                    viz, that statutory provisions which are inserted

                    later in time should not necessarily be governed by or interpreted based on

                    earlier material – is all the more apposite. statutory provisions are

                    sometimes adopted with modifications or undergo amendments before they are

                    passed into law. bills, drafts, precursors and parliamentary speeches should not

                    be resorted to uncritically. looking to another jurisdiction with similar

                    statutory provisions, which may be helpful in some cases, should also be done

                    bearing in mind factors like possible differences in the purpose of the

                    corresponding foreign statutory provisions, possible differences between the

                    legislative history of that foreign jurisdiction and the legislative history of

                    singapore, the context of the legal system or statute within which the

                    corresponding foreign statutory provisions are contained, as well as possible

                    differences in that foreign jurisdiction’s society and its individual or

                    special needs. in this case, given ag howell’s articulation in 1938

                    of the purpose of the howell amendment, i do not think the ascertainment of the

                    purpose of s 377a would be helped very much by looking at english sources;

                    these sources can only be contextual background at best.
71     when singapore formed part of malaysia in

                    1963, the federal constitution of malaysia which contained art 8 became

                    applicable. when singapore became an independent and sovereign nation on

                    9 august 1965, it adopted the constitution, which contained art 12

                    within part iv (headed “fundamental liberties”). does the

                    fact that singapore did not have a constitution in 1938 in some way affect

                    s 377a’s validity once the constitution came into being in august

                    1965? the short answer is no. as noted by the court of appeal in taw cheng kong (ca), equality before the law and equal

                    protection of the law became part of the wider doctrine of the rule of law and

                    were already an important part of the law of england when english law was

                    imported into singapore by the second charter of justice in 1826. equality

                    before the law and equal protection of the law were therefore already part of

                    the law of our land when s 377a was introduced in 1938. that said, no

                    challenge as to s 377a’s validity has been made until these cases were

                    brought.
(c)   the october 2007 parliamentary debates
72     the next significant event, as far as the

                    purpose or object of s 377a is concerned, occurred in october 2007 when

                    parliament considered major revisions to the 1985 penal code through the penal

                    code (amendment) bill 2007 (bill 38 of 2007) (“the 2007

                    bill”). the then senior minister of state for home affairs, assoc

                    prof ho peng kee (“assoc prof ho”), made the following

                    introduction at the 2007 bill’s second reading (see singapore parliamentary debates, official

                        report (22 october 2007) vol 83

                    at cols 2175–2176):
sir, the penal code [ie, the 1985 penal

                        code] is the primary criminal statute in singapore with more than 500

                        provisions. it is a key part of the corpus of singapore’s laws which

                        have served us well in keeping our law and order situation under control all

                        these years. as a major criminal statute, its provisions reflect our

                        society’s norms and values. this review is the most comprehensive

                        undertaken since 1984, when we amended the penal code [(cap 103,

                        1970 rev ed)] to introduce mandatory minimum punishment for several

                        serious offences. now, we are amending the code so that it remains effective

                        in a dynamic and changing environment that remains challenging.
assoc prof ho told parliament that this comprehensive review of

                    the 1985 penal code was a process which had stretched over two to three years.

                    the government had worked closely with the attorney-general’s chambers,

                    the ministry of law and other government agencies, and had taken into account

                    legislative changes in other jurisdictions as well as comments made by judges in

                    their judgments. the amendments before parliament had also been refined through

                    a robust process of public consultation, with input from members of the public,

                    professional organisations, stakeholders of the criminal justice system, the law

                    society of singapore, the subordinate courts and the singapore academy of law;

                    there had also been multiple points of engagements with people from different

                    walks of life.
73     pursuant to this comprehensive review of the

                    1985 penal code, s 377 was repealed, but s 377a was retained. both the

                    plaintiffs and the defendant have relied on the various speeches made on 22 and

                    23 october 2007 during the october 2007 parliamentary debates in their

                    respective submissions.
74     this reliance on the october 2007

                    parliamentary debates raises two questions which i put to the parties:
(a)     what is the position where, after a

                        statutory provision is enacted, there are subsequent parliamentary debates

                        on the same provision? can these be looked at to re-examine the purpose of

                        the provision, and if so, what is the effect if the re-examination reveals

                        further or new reasons for or expands upon the original purpose of the

                        provision?
(b)     what

                        happens if the original purpose of the statutory provision is no longer

                        applicable or acceptable, but there is a new purpose which that statutory

                        provision can still fulfil? can that new purpose be substituted for the

                        original purpose in ascertaining the constitutionality or otherwise of the

                        statutory provision?
75     in answering the first of the two questions

                    above, it is important to remember four facts:
(a)     first, the october 2007

                        parliamentary debates were not debates on the enactment or introduction of

                        s 377a. at the time of those parliamentary debates, s 377a was an

                        existing provision and no amendments thereto were being

                    proposed.
(b)     secondly,

                        a comprehensive review of the 1985 penal code had been undertaken and it had

                        been decided, after due deliberation and consultations, to repeal s 377

                        but not s 377a.
(c)     thirdly, s 377a became an issue during the october 2007

                        parliamentary debates because a nmp, mr siew kum hong, submitted a

                        petition dated 6 october 2007 signed by 2,341 citizens calling for the

                        repeal of s 377a (“the petition”). (it should be noted

                        that under the constitution, nmps have limited voting rights in

                        parliament.)
(d)     fourthly, no vote was taken on the petition or on whether to repeal

                        s 377a, albeit it was clear that the majority of the members of

                        parliament were in favour of retaining s 377a.
76     the petition called for s 377a to be

                    repealed along with s 377. it recited, inter

                        alia, that:
(a)     with the repeal of s 377, anal

                        and oral sex between heterosexual couples would no longer be an offence. in

                        comparison, the continued existence of s 377a would prejudice the

                        rights and interests of homosexual and bisexual men in an unconstitutional

                        manner.
(b)     section 377a was discriminatory because the same act of “gross

                        indecency” between heterosexual couples was permitted, but it was

                        criminalised if performed between homosexual and bisexual

                    men.
(c)     such

                        discrimination infringed art 12(1).
(d)     even if it was accepted that singapore was a

                        conservative society where the majority had a negative attitude towards

                        homosexuality, this discrimination against homosexual and bisexual men

                        represented the tyranny of the majority, and this was exactly what

                        art 12(1) was intended to protect the minority

                    against.
(e)     the stated

                        rationale of s 377a failed the “rational relation” test

                        for determining the constitutionality of a deviation from

                        art 12(1).
(f)     according to the public consultation paper and the proposed amendments

                        issued by the ministry of home affairs, our penal code (ie, the 1985 penal code, at the time of the october 2007

                        parliamentary debates) was intended to maintain a safe and secure society.

                        the amendments were meant to bring the 1985 penal code up to date, and

                        decriminalising private sexual conduct between consenting adults would not

                        make singapore unsafe or less secure.
(g)     furthermore, reflecting the public’s conservative

                        attitude towards sex was not one of the stated aims of our penal code or

                        even the 2007 bill. yet, the stated objective of s 377a was to reflect

                        public morality; s 377a was therefore not rational when assessed

                        against the legitimate aims of our penal code.
(h)     no harm was done to society when consenting

                        heterosexual adults had sex in private. why should it be any different when

                        it came to sex between two men in private? the correct basis for determining

                        the criminality or otherwise of sexual acts between adults should be

                        consent.
(i)     section 377a represented an unconstitutional derogation from the

                        guarantee of equality and equal protection encapsulated in

                        art 12(1).
(j)     it was undisputed that society found extra-marital affairs immoral. yet,

                        our penal code did not criminalise such activities.
(k)     throughout history, public morality as

                        a justification for discriminatory action had never stood up over time. it

                        had been used in the past by other countries to enforce slavery,

                        discrimination against racial and religious minorities and discrimination

                        against women, and none of these forms of institutional discrimination

                        remained today.
(l)     article 12(1) states the principle simply but elegantly: all persons

                        are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the

                        law.
the petition ended by respectfully requesting

                    parliament to uphold the fundamental principle set out in art 12(1), and

                    extend equal protection to all singaporeans in respect of their private

                    consensual conduct, regardless of their sexual orientation.
77     in my judgment, if the purpose of a provision

                    was articulated in parliament when it was first introduced, and at some later

                    date, a comprehensive review of the act containing that provision was carried

                    out and it was decided that the provision should be retained, then absent any

                    unusual facts or circumstances, the purpose of the provision as articulated in

                    parliament when the provision was first introduced will still be the purpose for

                    which that provision was enacted.
78     should we look at the october 2007

                    parliamentary debates to ascertain the purpose or object of s 377a? i do

                    not think there is a need to do so, but in any event, i found that those debates

                    did not assist the plaintiffs at all. in this case, the purpose of s 377a

                    was articulated, albeit within the context of a colonial government, when it was

                    enacted by the legislative council in 1938. section 377a was considered

                    again some 69 years later, and it was decided that the provision should be

                    retained even though s 377 was to be repealed. that was the view taken by

                    parliament in 2007. in effect, the purpose of s 377a, as articulated by

                    ag howell in 1938, was reaffirmed by parliament in 2007. that purpose

                    therefore still remains valid today (see [77] above).
79     be that as it may, as the plaintiffs have made

                    lengthy submissions, inter alia, to the effect

                    that: (a) the purpose of s 377a is no longer valid; (b) the

                    government has said that it is not going to pro-actively enforce s 377a;

                    and (c) the purpose of leaving s 377a on the statute books is not to

                    polarise society but to maintain social cohesion, i shall proceed to examine

                    these submissions.
80     during the october 2007 parliamentary debates,

                    assoc prof ho told parliament that s 377 would be repealed as it was

                    intended to remove the use of the archaic term “carnal intercourse

                    against the order of nature”. consequently, any sexual act, including

                    oral and anal sex, between a consenting heterosexual couple aged 16 and above

                    would no longer be a crime when done in private. assoc prof ho said that

                    our penal code reflected social norms and values, and repealing s 377 was

                    the right thing to do as singaporeans by and large did not find oral and anal

                    sex in private between a consenting male adult and a consenting female adult

                    offensive or unacceptable. this was clear from the public reaction to the

                    decision in annis bin abdullah v public prosecutor

                    [2004] 2 slr(r) 93, which reaction was confirmed through public feedback

                    during the review of the 1985 penal code and the public consultation which took

                    place pursuant to that review.
81     assoc prof ho then went on to explain

                    that s 377a, which criminalised acts of “gross indecency”

                    between two male adults, would be retained. he said that public feedback on

                    s 377a was emotional, divided and strongly expressed, with the majority

                    calling for s 377a’s retention. assoc prof ho also explained

                    that singapore was still a conservative society where the majority found

                    homosexual behaviour offensive and unacceptable.
82     assoc prof ho further said that since

                    neither side (ie, respectively, those in favour of

                    retaining s 377a and those in favour of repealing it) was going to be able

                    to persuade or convince the other of its position, we should live and let live,

                    and let the situation evolve in tandem with the values of our society. this

                    approach was a pragmatic one that maintained singapore’s social cohesion.

                    assoc prof ho also said that the police had not been proactively enforcing

                    s 377a and would continue to take this stance except where minors were

                    exploited or abused or where male adults committed the offence in public places

                    such as public toilets or back-lanes. assoc prof ho said that whilst

                    homosexuals had a place in society and had, in recent years, been given more

                    social space, repealing s 377a would be very contentious and might send the

                    wrong signal that the government was encouraging and endorsing the homosexual

                    lifestyle as part of our mainstream way of life.
83     quite a number of mps and nmps rose to speak

                    during the october 2007 parliamentary debates, at times passionately and

                    vigorously, with well-reasoned points that focused on the many different aspects

                    to the retention or otherwise of s 377a. the debate crossed party lines,

                    with some members of the ruling people’s action party advocating

                    s 377a’s repeal, but a larger number supporting its retention. the

                    opposition mp, mr chiam see tong, like some other mps, did not touch on

                    s 377a, while non-constituency mp ms sylvia lim, chairman of the

                    workers’ party, told parliament quite candidly that the workers’

                    party’s leadership had extensively discussed the issue and, having been

                    unable to arrive at a consensus that s 377a should be repealed, were

                    accordingly not calling for its abolition. there were certainly polarised views.

                    quite a few mps recounted anecdotal incidents of parents’ non-acceptance

                    of homosexual behaviour by their children. these parents’ reactions were

                    not very different from the initial reaction of mr lim’s mother set

                    out above at [3].
84     counsel for the plaintiffs, mr low,

                    pointed to the later portions of the speech by prime minister lee hsien

                    loong (“the prime minister”) during the october 2007 parliamentary

                    debates and submitted that in view of the reasons put forward for the retention

                    of s 377a, the purpose of the provision was now this: since neither the

                    pro-s 377a side nor the anti-s 377a side would be able to convince the

                    other of its point of view, and since pushing the issue would polarise and

                    divide our society, we should live and let live, and it was best that we do

                    nothing and leave s 377a as it stood. that, mr low submitted, could

                    not be a legitimate purpose for legislation. with respect, i cannot disagree

                    more. first and foremost, the purpose submitted by mr low was not, on any reading of the official record of the

                    october 2007 parliamentary debates, put forward as the purpose of s 377a. instead, it was a practical reason why,

                    amongst other more basic reasons, s 377a should be retained. secondly,

                    mr low’s submission was derived by taking a small part of three or

                    four paragraphs of the official record of the october 2007 parliamentary debates

                    out of context in an attempt to frame a purpose. it is quite clear from the

                    prime minister’s speech, as well as from the speeches of other mps who

                    spoke in favour of s 377a’s retention, that they viewed s 377a

                    and its continued retention as follows:
(a)     whether s 377a should be

                        retained or repealed was a question of morality and concerned the moral

                        values of singapore society. singapore was a conservative society where the

                        majority did not accept homosexual behaviour and wanted s 377a to be

                        retained (as an example, the prime minister pointed out that as against the

                        2,341 signatures on the petition, there were, at the time of his speech in

                        parliament, 15,560 signatures on a counter-petition to retain

                        s 377a).
(b)     the family was still the basic building block of singapore society, and a

                        “family” meant one man marrying one woman, having children and

                        bringing up their children within the framework of a stable family unit.

                        that was the policy of the government, and the government, after extensive

                        feedback and long discussion, wanted to maintain that status

                    quo.
(c)     the aforesaid

                        concept of a “family” was what was taught in schools. the vast

                        majority of singaporeans wanted to keep it that way, and so did the

                        government.
parliament also accepted that: (a) male

                    homosexuals had already been given more social space and were part of our

                    society; and (b) the policy of not enforcing s 377a actively, save

                    where minors were exploited or abused or where grossly indecent acts were

                    committed by male adults in public, would be continued. the majority of the mps

                    were of the view that whilst retaining s 377a might be legally untidy,

                    repealing it would result in the loss of a moral signpost and would not reflect

                    the views of a vast majority of society who were not ready to accept

                    homosexuality as part of our mainstream way of life. the majority were against

                    putting homosexual couples on par with normal heterosexual couples who conceived

                    children and formed the basic building blocks of families in our

                society.
85     it is clear from the speeches made during the

                    october 2007 parliamentary debates that the purpose of s 377a has not changed from the purpose

                    articulated by ag howell in 1938. after extensive consultations at all

                    levels, the government decided to repeal s 377 but retain s 377a.

                    because of the petition presented to parliament, which called for the repeal of

                    s 377a, the debate over the abolition or retention of this provision took

                    place and in fact overshadowed the rest of the proposed amendments to the 1985

                    penal code. the reason for s 377a’s retention, which affirmed the

                    purpose of the provision as articulated by ag howell in 1938, was that

                    singapore was a conservative society where the majority did not accept

                    homosexuality. one mp said that based on his constituents’ feedback, the

                    majority found homosexual behaviour offensive and repugnant. one of the last few

                    mps to speak, dr muhammad faishal ibrahim, said (see singapore parliamentary debates, official

                        report (22 october 2007) vol 83 at

                    cols 2469–2472): “the message that i heard loud and clear is

                    that the majority of singaporeans are not ready for open homosexuality acts to

                    be part of our way of life yet.”
86     the plaintiffs contended that as one of the

                    purposes of s 377a was to preserve the “family” (as described

                    at [84(b)] above) as the basic building block of our society, s 377a was

                    discriminatory as the behaviour of lesbians and those who had extra-marital sex

                    would also undermine this “purpose”, but such groups were not

                    targeted as criminals. in my view, this contention is incorrect. [84(b)] above

                    does not set out the purpose of s 377a.

                    instead, it states a value shared by singapore society, and s 377a by

                    itself does not bring about this value or ensure its continuity. it is clear

                    that this shared value stems not from our penal law, but from societal mores and

                    norms which have been built up over time and which are supported by the

                    government’s policy to promote the same.
87     the second query which i raised at [74(b)]

                    above, arose during the course of the oral submissions before me – what if

                    the original purpose of a statutory provision is no longer applicable or

                    acceptable, but there is a new purpose that the provision can now fulfil? for

                    example, if medical science can prove today that sexual orientation is entirely

                    inborn –

                    ie, determined entirely by nature – and is

                    not influenced at all by parental/societal nurturing or lifestyle choices, then

                    the targeting of male homosexuals by s 377a may no longer justifiable. but,

                    if medical science today can show that indulging in male homosexual conduct is a

                    major factor for the spread of hiv/aids, can the new purpose of curbing the

                    spread of hiv/aids be substituted for the original purpose of s 377a?

                    hiv/aids was certainly not around in 1938, and society then saw male

                    homosexuality as a lifestyle choice or a matter of personal conduct. 75 years

                    later, can the aforesaid new purpose of s 377a still sustain the provision

                    if the premise of its original purpose is no longer valid? it is interesting to

                    note that both mr abdullah sc and mr low accepted that we can

                    substitute this new purpose as a valid purpose of s 377a. intriguing as

                    this issue is, it does not, however, arise on the facts of this case. i shall

                    therefore leave it for another occasion if and when it does become an issue for

                    decision.
(3)   does the differentia underlying the classification

                prescribed by s 377a bear a rational relation to the purpose of the

                provision?
(a)   the meaning of “rational relation”
88     having stated the purpose of s 377a (see

                    [67] above), i now turn to the next element of the second limb, viz, whether the differentia underlying the

                    classification prescribed by s 377a has a rational relation to the purpose

                    of this provision (see [49] above).
89     what is meant by the term

                    “rational”? it seems clear to me that it must mean something that

                    is based on, endowed with or governed by reason. it must be, at the minimum,

                    reasonable in the sense that it is capable of being supported or justified by

                    reason and is in conformity with what is fairly to be expected or called for.

                    that rationality is tied to reasonableness in this sense can be seen from the

                    judgment of mukherjea j in the indian supreme court’s decision in

                        chiranjit lal at 911–912:
… the legislature undoubtedly has a wide field of choice in

                        determining and classifying the subject of its laws, and if the law deals

                        alike with all of a certain class, it is normally not obnoxious to the

                        charge of denial of equal protection; but the

                            classification should never be arbitrary. it must always rest upon some

                            real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation

                            to the things in respect to which the classification is made; and

                            classification made without any substantial basis should be regarded as

                            invalid. … [original citation omitted; emphasis added

                        in italics]
90     mukherjea j makes a number of

                    propositions. the first is a general one that classifications prescribed by law

                    should not be arbitrary. the second elaborates on how this is ensured.

                    classifications prescribed by law must be founded on a substantial or

                    discernible basis, such that it will be known who falls within or without the

                    ambit of the law. this is the “intelligible differentia”

                    requirement. mukherjea j’s third proposition is that the differentia

                    underlying a classification must bear a “reasonable and just

                    relation” to the reason why the classification was prescribed in the

                    first place. this is essentially an elaboration of the “rational

                    relation” test. the final point is that where the classification

                    prescribed by a law does not satisfy the two aforesaid requirements, it should

                    be regarded as invalid.
91     therefore, the meaning of “rational

                    relation” is a relation that is also reasonable and just. indeed, this

                    seems to be the standard adopted by the singapore courts in applying the

                    “rational relation” test to legislation which is said to violate

                    art 12. in ong ah chuan, the privy council,

                    in deciding that the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in heroin exceeding

                    15g was not contrary to art 12, found (at [38]) that:
there is nothing unreasonable in the

                        legislature’s holding the view that an illicit dealer on the wholesale

                        scale who operates near the apex of the distributive pyramid requires a

                        stronger deterrent to his transactions and deserves more condign punishment

                        than do dealers on a smaller scale who operate nearer the base of the

                        pyramid. [emphasis added]
92     this concept of reasonableness was also relied

                    upon by the high court in taw cheng kong (hc).

                    karthigesu ja canvassed an “ordinary and reasonable man”

                    test, and applied the test in arriving at the following conclusion (at

                    [70]):
pressed, therefore, to conclude whether or not there is a sufficiently

                        strong nexus between the objective of s 37 [of the pca] and the basis

                        for classification, i think the ordinary and reasonable

                            man would answer the question in the negative: the basis of

                        classification is an inadequate means of achieving the objective. i cannot

                        state in more certain terms that the objective of the section is noble, and

                        i agree wholeheartedly with the public prosecutor’s observation that

                        without an extraterritorial dimension, the whole objective of the [pca] is

                        too easily defeated. however, my conclusion is that this noble objective was

                        aspired to by unconstitutional means. [emphasis added]
93     the concept of reasonableness is, therefore,

                    central to the inquiry into whether the “rational relation” test

                    is satisfied in any particular case. in addition, some principles have emerged

                    from previous case law which set out helpful pointers for the courts in deciding

                    whether the differentia underlying the classification prescribed by a piece of

                    legislation bears a reasonable and just relation to the purpose of that

                    legislation. i shall elaborate on two of these principles at [94]–[99]

                    below.
(i)   the differentia underlying the prescribed classification

                must be broadly proportionate to the purpose of the law which prescribes that

                classification
94     an important part of the “rational

                    relation” requirement is that the differentia underlying the

                    classification prescribed by a law must be broadly proportionate to the purpose

                    of that law. in yong vui kong, where the

                    constitutional challenge was to the allegedly arbitrary divide of 15g of heroin,

                    above which an accused faced the death penalty but below which he did not, the

                    court of appeal approved the passages in ong ah

                        chuan cited above at [59], and further added (at [112] of

                        yong vui kong):
we would also add that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not

                        only broadly proportionate to the quantity of

                        addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug

                        dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to

                        the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender’s crime. for

                        these reasons, we find that the 15g differentia bears a rational relation to

                        the social object of the [misuse of drugs act (cap 185, 2001 rev

                        ed)]. [emphasis added]
the court of appeal was effectively ensuring that the relation between

                    the differentia based on 15g of heroin and the object of the misuse of drugs act

                    (cap 185, 2001 rev ed) (“the mda”) (which, inter alia, made the death penalty mandatory for drug

                    traffickers convicted of trafficking in more than 15g of heroin) was a

                    reasonable and just one by testing the efficacy of that differentia in achieving

                    the purpose of the mda.
95     it is clear that in using the term

                    “broadly proportionate”, the court of appeal in yong vui kong did not mean that the prescribed differentia had

                    to be the most effective means of achieving the object of the mda. the court of

                    appeal was merely ensuring that the differentia underlying the classification

                    prescribed by the mda was not one which was so far removed from the object of

                    the mda that it would result in an unreasonable and unjust relation between the

                    two. so long as the differentia underlying the classification prescribed by a

                    piece of legislation is broadly effective to achieve the object of that

                    legislation, it is not the court’s function to displace parliament’s

                    decision in prescribing that classification. furthermore, what is the most effective differentia to use as the basis of a

                    classification prescribed by law is something which “reasonable people

                    may well disagree [on]”, and this is a matter which “lies within

                    the province of the legislature, not the judiciary” (see yong vui kong at [113]):
our finding that there is a rational relation between the 15g differentia

                        and the social object of the mda should not, however, be taken to mean that

                        this differentia is the best and that there is no other better differentia

                        which would further the social object of the mda. in this regard, we

                        appreciate the points made in mr ravi’s second, third and fourth

                        arguments at [104]–[106] above, all of which suggest possible reasons

                        for expanding the differentia to take into account something more than just

                        the quantity of controlled drugs trafficked. we should

                            also point out that although a differentia which takes into account

                            something more than merely the quantity of controlled drugs trafficked

                            may be a better differentia than the 15g differentia, what is a better

                            differentia is a matter on which reasonable people may well disagree.

                            this question is, in truth, a question of social policy, and, as the

                            privy council stated in ong ah chuan at

                            673 (quoted at [101] above), it lies within the province of the

                            legislature, not the judiciary. our judiciary has to respect

                        the constitutional role of our legislature as delineated in the singapore

                        constitution (under art 38), and this is why our courts will only act

                        to ensure that the differentia employed in the mda for determining when the

                        [mandatory death penalty] is to be imposed bears a rational relation to the

                        social object of that statute. as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, we

                        find that the 15g differentia does satisfy this test. [emphasis

                        added]
the court’s role and function is not to second-guess whether

                    parliament could have or ought to have devised a more

                        efficacious differentia. instead, the court can intervene only if

                    the differentia enacted by parliament is so clearly inefficacious that it would

                    not even be capable of being considered broadly

                        proportionate to the object of the legislation in

                    question.
(ii)   under-inclusiveness and over-inclusiveness
96     another facet of the “rational

                    relation” requirement is that the prescribed classification has to

                    broadly fit the object of the law prescribing that

                    classification in terms of the scope of its application. “fit” is

                    another way of capturing the concepts of under- and over-inclusiveness, which

                    were first judicially examined and recognised in singapore in taw cheng kong (hc) and taw cheng kong

                        (ca). in taw cheng kong (hc),

                    karthigesu ja held (at [64]) that:
... parliament’s classification of persons on the basis of

                        citizenship is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive, that is, the net cast by the legislature catches a class of persons not

                            contemplated as falling within the objectives of the act

                            [viz, the pca], and

                            also does not catch a class of persons who clearly do fall within the

                            mischief sought to be addressed. for example, a singapore

                        citizen now a foreign permanent resident, employed in the foreign country by

                        the foreign government, receiving a bribe paid in the foreign country in a

                        foreign currency by a foreign payor is guilty of an offence under the act.

                        at the same time, a singapore permanent resident or a foreigner working for

                        the singapore government who agrees to take a short trip outside singapore

                        to receive a bribe in singapore dollars in relation to an act he will then

                        do in singapore is not caught by the act. this is so even though the threat

                        posed in the latter case is so much more obvious and direct than in the

                        former example. lying between the two extremes are many shades of grey. what

                        is clear is that in such cases, citizenship is not a useful criteria for

                        determining guilt. [emphasis added]
97     where the differentia underlying the

                    classification prescribed by a piece of legislation results in that

                    classification applying either too broadly or too narrowly, it should follow

                    that the strength of the relation between the differentia and the objective of

                    that legislation may not be sufficiently strong to justify making that

                    classification. in other words, the “reasonableness of the classification

                    is insufficient”: see taw cheng kong (hc)

                    at [65].
98     that said, a complete coincidence between the

                    classification prescribed by a piece of legislation and the class defined by the

                    object of that legislation is not necessary in order for the relation between

                    the differentia underlying the classification and the object of the legislation

                    to be a reasonable one. this is eloquently elaborated upon by huang-thio at p 431:
[i]n determining whether the inequality produced in a classification is

                        trivial or not, the court has to embark on an investigation into the

                            degree of inequality involved. indeed,

                        this is precisely what the courts do all the time when faced with equal

                        protection problems. the reason is that the doctrine of

                            reasonable classification does not demand a perfect classification,

                            i.e., a complete coincidence of the class defined by the law and the

                            class defined by the purpose of the law. under this doctrine,

                        the courts may sustain or reject an imperfect classification, depending on

                        the degree of inequality involved. the measure of

                            reasonableness of a classification depends on the degree of its success

                            in treating similarly those similarly placed, and the closer the

                            correspondence between the legislative classification and that implied

                            by the purpose of the law, the easier it is to sustain the

                            classification as reasonable. [emphasis added]
prof tan further opines in tan yock

                        lin (at p 17) that us case law shows that:
… [t]ypical responses to the compositional constraint have been to

                        support underinclusive classifications in terms of legislative leeway and

                        overinclusive criteria in terms of urgency or emergency.
99     with regards to over-inclusiveness, there have

                    been us and indian cases, where the courts have held that an over-inclusive

                    classification might nevertheless satisfy the “rational relation”

                    test. these cases usually involve situations of emergency or relate to policies

                    which entail positive discrimination: see hirabayashi v

                        united states 320 us 81 (1943), korematsu

                        v us 323 us 214 (1944) (“korematsu”), ramakrishnan singh v

                        state of mysore air 1960 mys 338 and kesava iyegar v state of mysore air 1956 mys 20. in

                    the singapore context, the high court in taw cheng kong

                        (hc), as stated above at [55(d)], held that the classification

                    prescribed by s 37(1) of the pca was both under- and over-inclusive, and

                    therefore failed the “rational relation” test. although this

                    conclusion was rejected by the court of appeal in taw cheng

                        kong (ca), the principle that over-inclusiveness could possibly

                    result in the “rational relation” test not being satisfied was not

                    rejected. it was merely that the court of appeal found over-inclusiveness not to

                    have arisen on the facts.
(b)   the object of s 377a bears a rational relation to the

                differentia underlying the classification prescribed
100    as established above at [67], the purpose of

                    s 377a is to criminalise male homosexual conduct because such conduct is

                    not acceptable or desirable in singapore society. the differentia underlying the

                    classification prescribed by s 377a, as established at [48] above, is that

                    of male homosexual conduct. therefore, s 377a is a law where there is a

                    complete coincidence between the differentia underlying the classification

                    prescribed by the legislation and the class defined by the object of that

                    legislation. given that the differentia adopted in s 377a results in a

                    classification which mirrors the purpose of s 377a, the differentia would be, at

                    the very least, broadly proportionate to the purpose of s 377a in terms of

                    efficacy; it also cannot be under-inclusive or over-inclusive vis-à-vis that purpose. in these circumstances, the relationship

                    between the differentia underlying the classification prescribed by s 377a

                    and the object of s 377a (or the mischief which it is designed to deter)

                    clearly satisfies the “rational relation” test.
101    mr low contends that since it was said

                    during the october 2007 parliamentary debates that s 377a would not be

                    actively enforced (save in the two instances mentioned at [82] above),

                    s 377a does not serve the function of signalling that male homosexual

                    conduct is undesirable and should not be practised openly. in my view, this

                    argument is without merit for two reasons. first, it is questionable whether, in

                    order for a criminal provision to fulfil its function of signalling that certain

                    conduct is undesirable and should not be practised openly, that criminal

                    provision must be enforced. of course, the

                    effectiveness of a criminal provision in fulfilling such a purpose would be

                    greater where enforcement is robust, but not all criminal provisions operate in

                    a similar manner. in the case of s 377a, the legislature has decided that

                    pursuing the policy of retaining s 377a while not advocating enforcement of

                    s 377a is adequate to fulfil the purpose of s 377a. this judgment made

                    by parliament should be respected. whether it is constitutional for the public

                    prosecutor to prosecute some but not others for an offence is a separate

                    question which i shall deal with later (see [135] below). the second reason why

                    i find mr low’s aforesaid argument unmeritorious lies in the

                    presumption of constitutionality, which i shall elaborate on shortly. for now,

                    the short answer to mr low’s argument is that the express retention

                    of s 377a as a criminal offence is a clear indication by parliament that

                    acts of “gross indecency” between males is not desired in

                    singapore, and this indication is sufficiently put across regardless of whether

                    or not parliament advocates a policy of active enforcement of s 377a. if

                    the plaintiffs seek to show that this is not the case (ie, that s 377a cannot serve its function of signalling

                    disapprobation of male homosexual conduct if it is not actively enforced),

                    compelling or cogent material or factual evidence has to be adduced. such

                    evidence has not been put forward.
the presumption of constitutionality
102    i turn now to the presumption of

                    constitutionality. i agree with mr abdullah sc’s submission that

                    the court must always be mindful of this presumption when applying the

                    “reasonable classification” test.
103    the court of appeal in taw cheng kong (ca) laid down the approach to be adopted in

                    cases where legislation is impugned as being unconstitutional. the starting

                    point is a strong presumption of constitutional validity. the basis for the

                    presumption of constitutionality, as stated by the us supreme court in middleton v texas power and light company 249 us

                    152 (1919) at 157 and cited with approval by the indian supreme court in

                        chiranjit lal at 913, is this:
it must be presumed that a legislature understands and correctly

                        appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are directed to

                        problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based

                        upon adequate grounds.
this proposition is further supported by the following passage from

                    the judgment of mohamed azmi scj in malaysian

                        bar at 170, which was cited with approval by the court of appeal

                    in taw cheng kong (ca) (at [58]):
in considering art 8 [of the malaysian constitution] there is a

                        presumption that an impugned law is constitutional, a presumption stemming

                        from the wide power of classification which the legislature must have in

                        making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons to

                        give effect to its policy.
104    the presumption of constitutionality is

                    given effect practically in a number of ways. the first is that the court

                        prima facie leans in favour of

                    constitutionality and supports the impugned legislation if it is reasonable to

                    do so. the second is that it is for the party who attacks the validity of a

                    piece of legislation to place relevant materials and evidence before the court.

                    these principles were established as far back as 1976 in su

                        liang yu (at 131):
when a law is challenged as offending the guarantee of equality and equal

                        protection of the law, the first duty of the court which is really a rule of

                        common sense is to examine the purpose and policy of the statute and then to

                        see whether a classification has been made and which does not result in a

                        real or actual discrimination. in its approach to the problem the court

                        ought prima facie, to lean

                            in favour of constitutionality and should support the legislation if it

                            is possible to do so on any reasonable

                            ground and it is for the party who

                            attacks the validity of the legislation to

                            place all materials before the court to show either the enactment or the

                            exercise of the power under it is arbitrary and

                            unsupportable. [emphasis added in italics and bold

                        italics]
105    the court of appeal in taw cheng kong (ca) reaffirmed (at [80]) that the burden of

                    proof lay with the challenger and, further, elucidated another way in which the

                    presumption of constitutionality had a bearing on a constitutional challenge to

                    a law. the court held (likewise at [80]) that postulating examples of

                    arbitrariness were not helpful in rebutting the presumption of

                    constitutionality:
… [u]nless the law is plainly arbitrary on its face, postulating

                        examples of arbitrariness would ordinarily not be helpful in rebutting the

                        presumption of constitutionality. this is because another court or person

                        can well postulate an equal number if not more examples to show that the law

                        did not operate arbitrarily. if postulating examples of arbitrariness can

                        always by themselves be sufficient for the purposes of rebuttal, then it

                        will hardly be giving effect to the presumption that parliament knows best

                        for its people, that its laws are directed at problems made manifest by

                        experience, and hence its differentiation is based on adequate

                        grounds.
the court of appeal then explained (also at [80]) how the presumption

                    of constitutionality might be rebutted:
… therefore, to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumption,

                            it will usually be necessary for the person

                            challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show

                            that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.

                        otherwise, there will be no practical difference between the presumption and

                        the ordinary burden of proof on the person asserting unconstitutionality. in

                        the present case, no such evidence was adduced by the respondent, and the

                        learned judge simply postulated examples of arbitrariness in a vacuum. that,

                        in our view, could not rebut the presumption. [emphasis added]
106    i would say that yick

                        wo is a good example of a challenger placing cogent material and

                    factual evidence before the court to show that the impugned executive action was

                    unjustifiably discriminatory and unconstitutional as it infringed the us

                    fourteenth amendment. what level and kind of material or factual evidence is

                    required will, of course, depend on the facts and circumstances of each

                    case.
107    lest i be taken to rule that the party

                    seeking to uphold the constitutionality of an impugned legislative provision

                    need only sit back and see what the challenger puts forward, i would point out

                    what wee chong jin cj noted at [19] of lee keng guan and

                        others v public prosecutor [1977–1978] slr(r) 78, citing

                    the indian supreme court decision of ram krishna

                        dalmia at 547–548:
… [w]hile good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on

                        the part of a legislature are to be presumed, if there is nothing on the

                        face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to the notice of

                        the court on which the classification may reasonably be regarded as based,

                        the presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent of

                        always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reasons for

                        subjecting certain individuals or corporation to hostile or discriminating

                        legislation.
108    finally, it may also be appropriate to

                    borrow a theme from the doctrine of justiciability. sundaresh menon jc, as

                    he then was, stated in lee hsien loong v review publishing co

                        ltd [2007] 2 slr(r) 453 at [98] that a calibrated approach

                    to judicial review should be adopted whereby the intensity of judicial review in

                    a particular case turned on factual content and common sense “which takes

                    into account the simple fact that there are certain questions in respect of

                    which there can be no expectation that an unelected judiciary will play any

                    role”. although menon jc’s remarks were made in the context of

                    judicial review of executive action, the doctrine of justiciability rests on the

                    doctrine of separation of powers, which in turn, has been described as a

                    fundamental doctrine of the constitution: see law society of

                        singapore v tan guat neo phyllis [2008] 2 slr(r) 239 at

                    [134].
109    professor thio li-ann, further adds that the

                    “[c]ourts will decline review in matters where they lack expertise or

                    special knowledge, or where their institutional capacity makes it ill-suited to

                    address issues like allocative decisions”: see thio li-ann, a treatise on singapore constitutional law (2012 academy

                    publishing) at para 03.024. the court of appeal appears to have recognised this

                    in yong vui kong at 113 (see [95] above).

                    professor thio li-ann and david chong gek sian sc, in “the chan

                    court and constitutional adjudication – ‘a sea change into something

                    rich and strange?’” in the law in his

                        hands (academy publishing, 2012) (chao hick tin et al eds) at p 103, para 28, opined that:
judicial review may also be constrained by the judicially-developed

                        doctrine of non-justiciability, a constitutional concept recognising the

                        limited “capacities of the courts”, which reflects the

                        “societal concern” that courts only undertake those functions

                        “appropriate to their place in the constitution and the way they are

                        structured and expected to operate”. this form of judicial

                        self-restraint implicates both a theory of judicial power and the particular

                        conception of separation of powers a political system is modelled

                        upon.
110    the presumption of constitutionality is

                    intimately tied to the idea of separation of powers and, to that end, where

                    issues of social morality are concerned, the calibrated approach mentioned at

                    [108] above should be tilted in favour of persons who are elected and entrusted

                    with the task of representing the people’s interests and

                will.
when will our courts find that a law or an application of a law

                contravenes art 12?
111    notwithstanding the foregoing, does the

                    strong presumption of the constitutionality of laws enacted by parliament mean

                    that our courts will never intervene to strike down a law as unconstitutional?

                    the answer must be a categorical and unqualified no.
112    it is both the duty and the constitutional

                    role of our courts to ensure that parliament does not contravene the rights

                    enshrined in the constitution for it is the constitution, and not parliament,

                    that is supreme in our legal system. our courts are the guardians who ensure

                    that the rule of law and all that it entails is observed and prevails.

                    successive chief justices of our supreme court have emphasised this role:
(a)     wee cj said in chng suan tze v minister of home affairs [1988]

                        2 slr(r) 525 at [86]:
all power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the courts

                            should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. if

                            therefore the executive in exercising its discretion under an act of

                            parliament has exceeded the four corners within which parliament has

                            decided it can exercise its discretion, such an exercise of discretion

                            would be ultra vires the act and a court

                            of law must be able to hold it to be so.
(b)     yong pung

                        how cj said in taw cheng kong (ca) at

                        [89]:
questions on the constitutionality of our laws and whether they have

                            been enacted ultra vires the powers of the

                            legislature are matters of grave concern for our nation as a whole. the

                            courts, in upholding the rule of law in singapore, will no doubt readily

                            invalidate laws that derogate from the constitution which is the supreme

                            law of our land.

                            attorney-general [2011] 2 slr 1189 highlighted (at [79])

                        that beyond art 149 of the constitution:
... parliament left untouched the full amplitude of the chng suan tze principle, and thereby implicitly

                            endorsed it. thus, in phyllis tan, this

                            court stated that the chng suan tze

                            principle, which was applied to a statutory power in chng suan

                                tze (viz, the power to make

                            detention orders and to suspend such orders under, respectively,

                            s 8 and s 10 of the internal security act), was also

                            applicable to a constitutional power.

(a)     chan cj,

                        writing extra-judicially in “securing and maintaining the

                        independence of the court in judicial proceedings” (2010)

                        22 saclj 229, also opined (at para 2) that:
the rule of law has meaning only if all are subject to the law and all

                            are equal before the law. hence, the governors as well as the governed

                            must respect the law and subject themselves to it. but respect for and

                            subjection to the law can only be sustained if a neutral institution exists to ensure that the law is

                            respected and enforced against all. that institution, in all

                            democracies, is the judiciary. it is in this sense that the judiciary is

                            the “lynchpin of a democratic society and the rule of

                            law”. [emphasis in original]
113    it is therefore not surprising that in many

                    of the cases involving constitutional challenges to legislation, even though the

                    challenges fail, the courts underline the fact that they will intervene if it is

                    warranted. for instance:
(a)     in ong ah

                            chuan, the privy council said (at [37]) that a legislative

                        provision which treated different classes of persons differently would not

                        be inconsistent with art 12 “[p]rovided that the factor which

                        the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is

                            not purely arbitrary but bears a

                        reasonable relation to the social object of the law” [emphasis

                        added].
(b)     in

                            kedar nath bajoria hari ram vaid v state of west

                            bengal air 1953 sc 404, the indian supreme court

                        said (at 406): “the legislative classification must not be arbitrary” [emphasis

                    added].
(c)     in

                            chiranjit lal, the indian supreme court

                        said (at 911–912): “the classification [prescribed] should never be arbitrary” [emphasis

                        added].
(d)     in

                            malaysian bar, the malaysian supreme court

                        held (at 167 per salleh abas lp)

                        that:
… [i]f the basis of the difference has a reasonable connection

                            with the object of the impugned legislation, the difference and

                            therefore the law which contains such provision is constitutional and

                            valid. if on the other hand there is no such relationship the difference

                            is stigmatized as discriminatory and the impugned legislation is

                            therefore unconstitutional and invalid.
(e)     in yong vui kong, our court of appeal pointed out lord

                        diplock’s unease in ong ah chuan when

                        the prosecution sidestepped answering his question as to whether, so long as

                        a statute was an act of parliament, it would constitute “law”

                        for the purposes of art 9(1) of the constitution, however unfair,

                        absurd or oppressive that statute might be. chan cj went on to say (at

                        [16] of yong vui kong):
perhaps, the privy council had in mind colourable legislation which

                            purported to enact a “law” as generally understood

                                (ie, a legislative rule of general

                            application), but which in effect was a legislative judgment, that is to

                            say, legislation directed at securing the conviction of particular known

                            individuals (see don john francis douglas liyanage v

                                the queen [1967] 1 ac 259 at 291), or legislation of so absurd or arbitrary a nature

                            that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional

                            framers as being “law” when they crafted the

                            constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties (ie, the provisions now set out in pt iv of

                            the singapore constitution). [emphasis added]
i do not advocate moving to the “strict

                    scrutiny” test of “a more searching judicial inquiry”

                    applied by the us courts when it comes to disadvantaged groups, suspect

                    classification or impinging on fundamental rights (see korematsu and united states v carolene

                        products co (1938) 304 us 144 at 152, n 4).

                    however, i would say it is only natural for our courts to scrutinise very

                    carefully a piece of legislation and the relation between its purpose and the

                    differentia underlying the classification prescribed therein if the court finds

                    not only that the differentia in question appears arbitrary, but that it also

                    appears to be discriminatorily based on factors like race or religion and

                    concerns the fundamental liberties set out in part iv of the

                    constitution.
114    i say this because it is possible to

                    conceive of cases where the object of the legislation is illegitimate. the fact

                    that such cases may be very far and few between does not preclude the

                    possibility that they can occur. the need for legitimacy of purpose is

                    heightened because whether the differentia underlying the prescribed

                    classification is found to be rationally related to the purpose of the

                    legislation depends on how broadly or narrowly the purpose of the legislation is

                    framed. if the legislation in question is truly discriminating arbitrarily and

                    without a legitimate purpose, the court cannot stand by the sidelines and do

                    nothing. parliament cannot introduce arbitrary and unjustified discrimination by

                    simply hiding behind the curtain of words and language used in impugned

                    legislation, or behind statements in parliamentary debates which will yield an

                    apparent purpose of the legislation concerned that invariably relates rationally

                    to the differentia underlying the classification prescribed by that legislation,

                    thereby satisfying the “reasonable classification” test. the

                    courts can, and will, critically examine and test such legislation where

                    necessary and appropriate.
115    dr thio addresses this issue by arguing

                    that “it is conceivable that a classification may satisfy the

                    ‘reasonable relation’ test and yet be invalid because the object

                    sought to be achieved is itself inherently bad” (see huang-thio at p 422). she then illustrates this, quite

                    aptly, by citing the case of takahashi v fish and game

                        commissioner 334 us 410 (1948). in that case, the

                    challenger, takahashi, was an alien under us immigration laws and was ineligible

                    for us citizenship. he was barred by californian law from earning his living as

                    a fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of california since californian

                    law prohibited the issue of commercial fishing licences to japanese aliens.

                    takahashi challenged that law on the ground of denial of equal protection. the

                    state of california argued that the law was passed as a fish conservation

                    measure, or alternatively, to protect californian citizens engaged in commercial

                    fishing from competition by japanese aliens. the us supreme court held that the

                    law violated the requirement of equality on either of these stated purposes. if

                    fish conservation was the purpose of the law, then a classification based on

                    ineligibility for citizenship had no rational relation to the purpose and was

                    therefore unconstitutional. if, on the other hand, the purpose was to protect

                    californian citizens engaged in commercial fishing from competition from

                    japanese aliens, then the legislation would have passed the “rational

                    relation” test and should have been upheld, but the fact that it was

                    struck down on this ground as well must mean that the law, which discriminated

                    against the targeted group based on racial grounds as an end in itself, violated

                    the requirement of equality because the objective sought was not legitimate. in

                    this regard, murphy and rutledge jj pointed out (at 427) that the law in

                    question was:
… directed in spirit and in effect solely against aliens of

                        japanese birth. it denies them commercial fishing rights not because they

                        threaten the success of any conservation program, not because their fishing

                        activities constitute a clear and present danger to the welfare of

                        california or of the nation, but only because they are of japanese stock

                        ...
116    i agree that this has to be the position

                    adopted in relation to art 12. however, the terminology of

                    “legitimacy” has to be very carefully understood.

                    “legitimacy” in the context of art 12 is undoubtedly a

                    substantive concept, and is relevant only in scrutinising the purpose of

                    legislation which applies to a very specific class of people in society. where a

                    piece of legislation does not satisfy the requirement of legitimacy of purpose,

                    the terms “capricious”, “absurd” and

                        “wednesbury unreasonableness”

                    come to mind. such legislation will more likely than not also infringe other

                    parts of the constitution as well. in directing my mind to whether the purpose

                    of a piece of legislation is legitimate or illegitimate, i accept that it would

                    be wrong to decide such a matter based on a blind acceptance of legislative

                    fiat. it is the court’s “duty to declare invalid any exercise of

                    power, legislative and executive, which exceeds

                    the limits of the power conferred by the constitution, or which contravenes any

                    prohibition which the constitution provides” [emphasis added]: see

                        chan hiang leng colin v minister for information and the

                        arts [1996] 1 slr(r) 294 at [50]. as the court of appeal

                    observed in nguyen at [73], a fundamental question

                    in most cases is “the proper weight that ought to be ascribed to the

                    views of parliament as encapsulated in the impugned

                legislation”.
the purpose of s 377a is not an illegitimate purpose
117    is the purpose of s 377a then

                    illegitimate? as stated above at [67], s 377a essentially addresses a

                    social and public morality concern which our legislature identified in 1938 and

                    subsequently affirmed in 2007. one possible argument that could be made against

                    the legitimacy of the purpose of s 377a is that female homosexual conduct

                    is not criminalised while male homosexual conduct is. this exclusion of female

                    homosexual conduct has been pointed out by the plaintiffs, and was also referred

                    to in tan eng hong at [126].
118    bearing in mind that the plaintiffs have not

                    produced cogent and compelling evidence to establish that such a purpose

                        (ie, criminalising only male homosexual

                    conduct and not female homosexual conduct) is illegitimate, and also taking into

                    consideration certain reasons which i shall elaborate upon shortly, i find that

                    the purpose of s 377a is not illegitimate as to warrant the court’s

                    intervention notwithstanding that the two-step tan eng

                        hong test is satisfied. there are two reasons for arriving at

                    this conclusion.
the weight of historical practices vis-à-vis male homosexual conduct

                suggests a basis for those practices
119    the first reason is grounded in the idea

                    that the courts should not be too quick to dismiss practices which have

                    persisted and developed within the framework of a common law legal system. it is

                    fair to presume that if a law has withstood the test of time, it cannot be

                    devoid of any basis. if the court is to pronounce that a law which has stood for

                    decades or centuries is wrong and ought not to have been enacted because its

                    bases, whatever they may be, are so flawed, a justification of proportionate

                    magnitude is invariably required. where such a justification is not evident or

                    forthcoming, whether or not any changes should be made to that law should be

                    left up to parliament. with this in mind, i proceed to state an undeniable fact,

                        viz, that the common law has for a long time

                    only proscribed male homosexual conduct, and not female homosexual

                    conduct.
120    english criminal law has always only

                    targeted male homosexual conduct, and not female homosexual conduct. an attempt

                    was made in 1921 in england to criminalise female homosexual conduct, but this

                    attempt was not successful. the proposed clause making female homosexual conduct

                    an offence read as follows:

acts of indecency by

                            females

any act of gross indecency between female persons shall be a misdemeanour,

                        and punishable in the same manner as any such act committed by male persons

                        under section eleven of the criminal law amendment act 1885 [ie, the uk 1885 act mentioned at [63] above].
the similarity between the above clause and s 11 of the uk 1885

                    act is unmistakable. it appears from the speech of the earl of malmesbury during

                    the house of lords’ debate on 15 august 1921 that this clause was

                    introduced in the early hours of the morning at the end of a session by some

                    private members of the house of commons (see hl

                        deb (16 august 1921) vol 43 at cols 567–577,

                    and likewise for all the subsequent quotes in this paragraph). the earl of

                    malmesbury felt that “this subject did not require serious attention, and

                    that such stories as [those members of the house of commons] heard were

                    exaggerated. … if, after careful inquiry, it is found desirable [to]

                    introduce a measure to make criminal this particular offence … [he] would

                    support it if [he] was convinced that it was needed”. the earl of desart

                    similarly spoke against the clause, saying that “it was a new clause,

                    involving a serious alternation in the criminal law and creating a new offence

                    – a course open to the greatest objection and of a very controversial

                    character”. the lord chancellor also said: “i hold the strongest

                    view, for the reasons stated by lord desart, that the case has not been

                    made out on its merits for such an alteration in the law”. the house of

                    lords refused to sanction passage of the clause. there does not appear to have

                    been another attempt to make female homosexual conduct an offence in england.

                    even in the wolfenden report, there is only one reference to indecent assaults

                    by females on females at para 103, which reads:

indecent assaults by females

                            on females

103.  since an indecent assault by one female on

                            another could take the form of a homosexual act, we have included

                            indecent assaults on females by females in the lists of homosexual

                            offences in paragraph 77 above. we have, however, found no case in

                            which a female has been convicted of an act with another female which

                            exhibits the libidinous features that characterise sexual acts between

                            males. we are aware that the criminal statistics occasionally show

                            females as having been convicted of indecent assaults on females; but on

                            enquiry we find that this is due in the main to the practice of

                            including in the figures relating to any particular offence not only

                            those convicted of the offence itself, but also those convicted of

                            aiding and abetting the commission of the offence. thus, a woman

                            convicted of aiding and abetting a man to commit an indecent assault on

                            a female would be shown in the statistics as having herself committed

                            such an assault.
121    the proscription by english criminal law of

                    only male homosexual conduct and not female homosexual conduct is, possibly, a

                    reflection of religious or other customary beliefs which have long permeated

                    english law and politics. one plausible basis for such beliefs is the

                    judeo-christian traditions, which proscribed male homosexual practices in the

                    clearest condemnatory terms in the old testament of the bible and even

                    prescribed the punishment of death by stoning. in comparison, there appears to

                    be only one passing reference in the new testament of the bible to women who

                    “exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to

                    nature” (see romans 1:26).
122    it could be argued that notwithstanding the

                    law against committing acts of “gross indecency”, there were other

                    laws relating to sexual offences which, on their plain wording, did not focus

                    only on male homosexual conduct but were instead gender-neutral, ie in the sense that the laws could possibly relate to

                    sexual conduct between females. this was pointed out by the court of appeal in

                        tan eng hong, which noted (at [26]) that

                    england’s buggery laws were gender-neutral whereas s 11 of the uk

                    1885 act was not. the phraseology in the now-repealed s 377 was certainly,

                    on its face, gender-neutral. but, it is with great diffidence and with great

                    respect that i venture a query as to whether the buggery laws of old were truly

                    gender-neutral. in my view, the basic physiological differences between

                    men’s and women’s genitalia must mean that our s 377 and

                    english sodomy laws were not gender-neutral.
123    we need to first examine the definitions of

                    “sodomy” and “bestiality”. the word

                    “sodomy” is defined in jowitt’s the

                        dictionary of english law (clifford walsh ed) (sweet &

                    maxwell limited, 1959) as unnatural sexual intercourse by a man with another man

                    or a woman; in criminal law, such sexual intercourse is known as

                    “buggery”. the reader is then directed by the definition provided,

                    to the term “abominable crime”, which is explained as the term

                    used in s 61 of the uk 1861 act (see [65] above) to describe the crimes of

                    buggery and bestiality. “buggery” is defined as carnal intercourse

                    by a male person with another person or an animal consisting of penetration

                        per anum, while “bestiality” is

                    defined as the crime of having carnal intercourse with beasts. there is also a

                    reference to the term “infamous crime”, which is defined in

                    s 46 of the larceny act 1861 (c 96) (uk) as “the abominable

                    crime of buggery, committed either with mankind or with beast ...”. the

                    definitions of “abominable crime”, “buggery”,

                    “bestiality” and “infamous crimes” are taken from

                        jowitt’s dictionary of english law

                    (daniel greenberg gen ed) (thomson reuters (legal) limited, 3rd ed,

                    2010).
124    it will be seen from a closer examination of

                    these definitions that they clearly are not gender-neutral. if the essence of

                    sodomy is penile penetration per anum, then two

                    women cannot sodomise one another. the definition of “buggery”

                    above also refers to penetration per anum; it

                    similarly cannot apply to “intercourse” between two women. in this

                    regard, i do not think that the offence of buggery applies to digital

                    penetration. the exception to this is that a woman can lie with a beast. the

                    buggery laws of old were therefore not gender-neutral as they depended on penile

                    penetration per anum. the explanation in

                    s 377 is similarly phrased: “penetration is sufficient to constitute

                    the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this

                    section.”
125    the use of the phrase “carnal

                    intercourse against the order of nature” in the now-repealed s 377

                    came later in time and was construed to include oral sex. in cases like

                        public prosecutor v tan kuan meng [1996] sghc

                    16 and public prosecutor v kwan kwong weng [1997]

                    1 slr(r) 316 (“kwan kwong

                    weng”), our courts, relying on some indian cases, construed

                    “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” in s 377 to

                    include fellatio. it is interesting to note that the court of appeal in

                        kwan kwong weng, whilst examining the legal

                    effect of fellatio in the context of s 377, only referred to cunnilingus

                    once towards the end of its judgment, and even then, when it came to what

                    amounted to “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”, the

                    court only mentioned fellatio at [31]:
approaching the question as we have done, consent becomes a material

                        element for when couples engaged in consensual sexual intercourse willingly

                        indulge in fellatio and cunnilingus as a stimulant to their respective

                        sexual urges, neither act can be considered to be against the order of

                        nature and punishable under s 377 of the [1985] penal code. in every other instance the act of fellatio between

                        a man and a woman will be carnal intercourse against the order of nature and

                        punishable under s 377. [emphasis added in bold italics]
the court of appeal seemed to have deliberately avoided saying that

                    cunnilingus (which allows for the possibility of a woman-to-woman sexual act to

                    be included) fell within s 377. therefore, even where s 377 was interpreted

                    to include oral sex, female homosexual conduct was never the

                issue.
126    it can, therefore, be seen that the common

                    law tradition has never criminalised female homosexual conduct.
specific traditions with regard to procreation and lineage
127    the second reason for my conclusion at [118]

                    above is that some portions of singapore society today still hold certain deep

                    seated feelings with regard to procreation and family lineage. this has

                    significance, because the courts should not readily dismiss the views of one

                    portion of society in favour of those of another portion of society. this is

                    especially so where parliament has made clear its position on the

                matter.
128    during the october 2007 parliamentary

                    debates, one of the mps, mr baey yam keng, referred to a chinese saying,

                        “bu xiao you san, wu hou wei

                    da”, which, translated into english, means: “there are

                    three unfilial acts, the greatest is not to have a son.” he explained

                    that the chinese portion of singapore society was still largely traditional,

                    with parents looking forward to their children marrying and producing offspring

                    in order to carry on the family name; male homosexuals, just like the

                    plaintiffs, are likely to appreciate that they would not be having children and

                    are likely to, therefore, disappoint their parents. this tradition of carrying

                    on the family name is focused on males rather than females, since the usual way

                    to carry on the family name is through the birth of a male

                descendant.
129    of course, this is not conclusive proof that

                    singapore society does indeed treat procreation and lineage as an important

                    value. however, the courts should not dismiss a legislative purpose as

                    illegitimate (under art 12), where there are plausible justifications for this

                    purpose within the context of singapore’s societal mores and

                norms.
130    accordingly, even if the plaintiffs had

                    argued that the purpose of s 377a was illegitimate, for the reasons above

                    (at [119]–[129]), i would be slow to find that there is no basis

                    whatsoever for parliament to have chosen to criminalise male homosexual conduct

                    only.
the remaining arguments raised by the plaintiffs
131    i now turn to deal with the remaining

                    contentions raised by the plaintiffs. in my judgment, the plaintiffs have not

                    offered or adduced any compelling or cogent material or factual evidence that

                    s 377a is arbitrary or operates in an arbitrary manner.
the term “gross indecency” is vague
132    the plaintiffs submit that the vague wording

                    of “gross indecency” in s 377a would result either in the

                    differentia in that provision being unintelligible or in that provision being

                    applied arbitrarily. i find these submissions misplaced. a law cannot be struck

                    down for being unconstitutional based merely on the contention, without further

                    substantiation, that it is worded in an allegedly vague manner. what amounts to

                    “gross indecency” is a matter of statutory interpretation. the

                    fact that there is some width in the interpretation of this term and, therefore,

                    there can be argument as to what acts amount to “gross indecency”

                    and what acts do not does not in itself make s 377a unconstitutional. in

                    this regard, i note that the term “indecent” is not unknown in our

                    criminal law: eg, it is used in relation to

                    criminal provisions concerning public exposure and exhibition in the

                    miscellaneous offences (public order and nuisance) act (cap 184,

                    1997 rev ed). the word “gross” is likewise not an unknown

                    adjective in our criminal law.
there is a world-wide movement to decriminalise homosexual

                activity
133    the plaintiffs have also made numerous

                    references to the decriminalisation of male homosexual conduct in other

                    jurisdictions as well as to the position taken on this issue by various

                    international and regional organisations. with respect, i find these submissions

                    to be of no weight. first and foremost, singapore is an independent nation with

                    its own unique history, geography, society and economy. what is adopted in other

                    parts of the world may not be suitable for adoption in singapore. secondly,

                    postulating examples of how the world is changing without more is unhelpful as

                    such examples can be countered by examples of areas where there are shifts in

                    the opposite direction. furthermore, it can be seen that a number of former

                    british colonies, such as botswana, malaysia, sri lanka, sudan, tanzania, yemen

                    and the solomon islands, have criminalised female

                    homosexual conduct while retaining their respective equivalents of s 377a.

                    the death penalty for male homosexual conduct is still retained in a few

                    countries. an apt illustration of such differences held by different societies

                    was brought up by the prime minister during the october 2007 parliamentary

                    debates when he highlighted the fact that even within the anglican or church of

                    england community, the asian and the african anglican churches had threatened to

                    split from the american and the english anglican churches over the ordination of

                    gay bishops. the short – and only relevant – answer to this point is

                    that our parliament has debated the removal of s 377a and has decided

                    against it.
if no one is to be prosecuted under s 377a, then why have

                s 377a?
134    during the october 2007 parliamentary

                    debates, assoc prof ho said that the police would not actively prosecute

                    cases under s 377a unless minors were preyed upon by homosexuals or unless

                    acts of “gross indecency” took place in public (see [82] above).

                    why then, the plaintiffs contend, is there a need to have s 377a on our

                    statute books if there is going to be no prosecution? with respect, i disagree

                    with this submission. in october 2007, parliament, after two days of intensive

                    debate, decided to retain s 377a. valid reasons were given for its

                    retention and the decision was supported by a majority of the mps. whether

                    s 377a can still fulfil its purpose of signalling the public’s

                    disapprobation of male homosexual conduct notwithstanding the policy of

                    non-enforcement is a consideration for parliament and is also supported by the

                    presumption of constitutionality. the plaintiffs have only provided mere

                    postulations, but no material evidence, to show that the purpose of s 377a

                    would not be achieved if the provision is not actively enforced.
135    furthermore, whether or not there is

                    prosecution of an offence is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. if there is

                    no prosecution of s 377a offences, that is no ground to say that

                    s 377a is unconstitutional. there is no complaint of arbitrary enforcement

                    in this case, and postulations that there may be

                    cases of arbitrary enforcement carry no weight in considering the issues that

                    have been raised in this originating summons. furthermore, if the issue is with

                    regard to the arbitrary enforcement of s 377a which results in an

                    infringement of art 12, this has been settled by the court of appeal in

                        ramalingam ravinthran v attorney-general

                    [2012] 2 slr 49; but more importantly, it is not an issue in the present

                    case.
the repeal of s 377 renders the retention of s 377a

                unjustified
136    in 2007, parliament recognised that social

                    norms and values in singapore had changed, and that the majority of singaporeans

                    no longer saw anything morally wrong or objectionable in consenting heterosexual

                    couples aged 16 and above engaging in oral and anal sex in private. i accept

                    that this represented a major shift in morality and principle. the plaintiffs

                    submit that since the objection to oral and anal sex in private between

                    consenting heterosexual couples aged 16 and above has been removed, there is no

                    logic in continuing to proscribe (via s 377a) anal and oral sex between two

                    consenting male adults.
137    the answer can perhaps be found in antonin

                    scalia j’s statement in his dissenting opinion in lawrence v texas 539 us 558 (2003) (“lawrence”) at 604:
one of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people

                        rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry

                        things to their logical conclusion. the people may feel that their

                        disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual

                        marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts

                        – and may legislate accordingly.
138    again, i repeat that during the october 2007

                    parliamentary debates, parliament considered s 377 and s 377a

                    carefully, and after debating the matter fully, endorsed the repeal of

                    s 377 but chose to retain s 377a. i can see no basis in this case to

                    interfere given my reasons set out above. it is clear that parliament saw a

                    reasonable differentia upon which to distinguish between two classes: anal and

                    oral sex in private between a consenting man and a consenting woman (both aged

                    16 and above) was acceptable, but the same conduct was repugnant and offensive

                    when carried out between two men even if both men were consenting parties. there

                    is therefore no reason to strike down the basis of the classification prescribed

                    by s 377a –

                    viz, male homosexuality – as arbitrary or

                    discriminatory, or on the ground that it does not bear any rational relation to

                    the purpose of the provision.
conclusion
139    we are a society in the midst of change.

                    some changes come fast; others evolve and take time to gain a hold and to gain

                    currency. in the latter case, a court will be hard put, when it stands at a

                    particular point in time between the two ends of the spectrum when the change in

                    a particular long-held social norm has yet to gain currency, to decide whether

                    that social norm should be retained or discarded in the face of a constitutional

                    challenge to that social norm. in our legal system, that decision is left to

                    parliament. even when society has clearly shifted closer to one end of the

                    spectrum, our courts can but call on parliament to consider changing the law.

                    that said, i also accept that there are times, albeit very rare, when a court is

                    able to say that a certain principle of law is outmoded and should no longer be

                    enforced. to my knowledge, this has only happened once in singapore, and that

                    was in relation not to a statutory provision, but to a common law cause of

                    action. in the case of tpy v dzi [1997]

                    1 slr(r) 843, a husband, whose wife had left him for another man, tried to

                    sue that man for damages for loss of consortium under the tort of enticement.

                    mph rubin j struck out the claim and held that the tort of enticement

                    was founded on an archaic concept of women as chattels, which was clearly not

                    acceptable in modern society (at [14]):
having regard to the perfunctory nature of the pleadings and taking the

                        pleadings at its face value, it is my view that to give currency to a cause

                        of action which had no known presence in singapore and one which had been

                        given a final farewell in its place of birth would be to lend a hand to

                        encouraging fruitless litigation for vindictive purposes. in my opinion,

                        though the tort of enticement might well have been received in singapore

                        under the second charter of justice, it cannot continue to serve any useful

                        purpose particularly when society no longer subscribes to the view that

                        women are mere chattels and whose existence is only to be in the service of

                        their husbands. sections 45, 46, 48 and 49 of the women’s charter

                        clearly underscore the aspect that a wife is a person in her own right and

                        not someone who is subordinate to, or a chattel of her husband.
140    in the us, it took a civil war to end

                    slavery and an even longer time to fully emancipate blacks; indeed, it was only

                    in 2008 that the us elected its first black president. in 1986, the us supreme

                    court held that the us constitution did not prohibit what almost all the states

                    had done from the founding of the us until recent times, viz, make homosexual conduct a crime: see bowers v hardwick 478 us 186 (1986) (“bowers”). some twenty years later, in june 2006,

                    the us supreme court in lawrence in effect

                    reversed bowers by a majority, holding that the

                    texas statute making “deviate sexual intercourse” with another

                    individual of the same sex a misdemeanour furthered no legitimate state interest

                    which could justify the statute’s intrusion into the personal and private

                    life of an individual. that case dealt with the liberty of the individual as

                    well as his right to privacy.
141    very recently, on 26 march 2013, the us

                    supreme court heard oral arguments in the first of two cases on same-sex

                    marriage, dennis hollingsworth et al v kristin m perry

                        et al (case no 12-144), which was an appeal from the

                    decision in perry v hollingsworth

                    671 f 3d 1052 (9th cir, 2012). the case concerned the

                    constitutionality of california’s proposition 8 (the result of a

                    referendum held in november 2008), which bans same-sex marriage by defining

                    “marriage” as a union between a man and a woman. the us supreme

                    court justices’ questions and observations in the course of hearing

                    arguments obviously do not necessarily reflect how they will eventually decide

                    the issue, but i find them telling all the same. the us supreme court justices

                    were clearly concerned about the pace of change. justice kennedy, uncertain

                    about the consequences for society if same-sex marriage was allowed, expressed

                    his caution that “[w]e have five years of information to weigh against

                    2,000 years of history or more”. justice alito jr echoed,

                    saying “[y]ou want us to step in and render a decision based on an

                    assessment of the effects of this institution [viz, same sex marriage] which is newer than cellphones or the

                    internet?” the other us supreme court justices too, appeared to have

                    reservations about having to determine the issue at this juncture.

                    justice sotomayor noted that that the us supreme court had taken its time

                    to decide on landmark issues before, for instance, letting “racial

                    segregation perk for 50 years from 1898 to 1954”. she was referring to

                    the seminal decision of brown v board of education

                    347 us 483 (1954), which barred racial segregation in public schools and

                    outlawed the “separate but equal” facilities for black people that

                    the us supreme court had upheld half a century earlier (see homer a plessy v ferguson 163 us 537 (1896)).
142    to my mind, defining moral issues need time

                    to evolve and are best left to the legislature to resolve. even the seminal case

                    of roe v wade 410 us 113 (1973) has been

                    doubted. justice ginsburg has often been quoted as saying that the decision

                    was incorrect, with the most recent instance being at an event in columbia law

                    school, where she said “[i]t’s not that the judgment was wrong, but

                    it moved too far, too fast”. justice ginsburg aptly sums up her

                    views on this matter in an article written when she was still a united states

                    circuit judge (see ruth bader ginsburg, “some thoughts on autonomy and

                    equality in relation to roe v. wade” (1985)

                    63 north carolina law review 375 at pp 385–386):

roe, i believe, would have been more

                        acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the

                        extreme statute before the court. the political process

                            was moving in the early 1970s, not

                            swiftly enough for advocates of quick, complete change, but the

                            majoritarian institutions were listening and acting. heavy-handed

                            judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to

                        have provoked, not resolved, conflict. [emphasis added in italics and bold

                        italics]
143    therefore it is not that the courts do not

                    have any role to play in defining moral issues when such issues are at stake.

                    however, the courts’ power to intervene can only be exercised within

                    established principles. the issue in the present case no doubt is challenging

                    and important, but it is not one which, in my view, justifies heavy-handed

                    judicial intervention ahead of democratic change.
144    as stated above, the basis underlying

                    s 377a’s existence is, in the final analysis, an issue of morality

                    and societal values. the views ventilated in parliament during the october 2007

                    parliamentary debates and at the hearing of this case are without a doubt

                    controversial and disparate among various segments of our society. what is

                    clear, however, is that parliament has decided that s 377a should be

                    retained. that decision is not one which is undeniably wrong. our courts cannot

                    substitute their own views for that of parliament.
145    as eloquently put by scalia j in his

                    dissenting opinion in lawrence

                    (at 603):
let me be clear that i have nothing against homosexuals, or any other

                        group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. social

                        perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group

                        has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters

                        is the best. that homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise

                        is attested to by the fact that texas is one of the few remaining states

                        that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. but persuading

                        one’s fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one’s views in

                        absence of democratic majority will is something else. i would no more

                        require a state to criminalize homosexual acts – or, for that matter,

                        display any moral disapprobation of them

                        – than i would forbid it to do so. what

                        texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic

                        action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a

                        brand-new “constitutional right” by a court that is impatient

                        of democratic change. [emphasis in original]
146    in my judgment, the object of s 377a is

                    clear. it criminalises male homosexual conduct as conduct that is not acceptable

                    in our society. its retention was endorsed by parliament in 2007. applying the

                    “reasonable classification” test, there is complete coincidence

                    between the differentia underlying the classification prescribed by s 377a

                    and the object of the provision. the differentia underlying the classification

                    prescribed by s 377a therefore bears a rational relation to the object of

                    the provision, and therefore satisfies both limbs of the “reasonable

                    classification” test set out at [46] above. therefore s 377a is neither

                    arbitrary nor discriminatory in the constitutional context. i also find that the

                    purpose of s 377a is not a purpose which is so patently wrong as to render

                    it an illegitimate purpose upon which to base a classification prescribed by

                    law.
147    for the reasons set out above, i decline to

                    make the orders (which are in truth for declarations) sought by the plaintiffs

                    and dismiss their claim that s 377a is unconstitutional and infringes their

                    rights under art 12.
148    i shall hear the parties on

                costs.
