(a) the investors were not given a reasonable opportunity to be heard on their claims against sm and gass (article 34(2)(a)(ii) uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration (the “model law”) and/or s 24(b) international arbitration act (cap 143a, 2002 rev ed) (“iaa”)).(b) the award was in conflict with singapore’s public policy of ensuring that parties to a dispute have fair access to justice (article 34(2)(b)(ii) model law).21 the investors’ case on both grounds are predicated on the same factual substratum, on the basis that an award that is liable to be set aside for a breach of natural justice under s 24(b) iaa necessarily falls within the wider public policy ground in article 34(2)(b)(ii) model law.

23 as regards the investors’ case on the public policy ground, the gol parties make three points. first, there was no denial of the investors’ right of access to justice: the tribunal found that the requirements for the doctrine of collateral estoppel were satisfied because the determinative issues in siac arbitration 414 had already been considered and decided against the investors by another arbitral tribunal in a previous arbitral proceeding, ie, the prior siac arbitration.

  investors’ written submissions at paras 6 and 53–54.



(a) the investors were unable to present their case on the gol costs order (s 19 iaa read with article 36(1)(a)(ii) model law).(b) the enforcement of the gol costs order would be contrary to the public policy of singapore (s 19 iaa read with article 36(1)(b)(ii) model law).(c) the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with parties’ agreement (s 19 iaa read with article 36(1)(a)(iv) model law).(d) the gol costs order was a decision on a matter beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration (s 19 iaa read with article 36(1)(a)(iii) model law).25 on the first ground, the investors claim that they were not given the opportunity to address a belated assertion made in the gol parties’ reply costs submissions dated 16 october 2020, viz, gol was obliged to pay its attorneys above the fee cap if it were “able to obtain and/or collect costs from the [investors]” [emphasis added].

  cmb at p 1578 (gol parties’ reply costs submissions at para 14).



 the investors complain that this assertion relating to gol’s fee arrangement (“gol’s fee arrangement”) was raised for the first time, and represented a marked departure from the original position taken in gol’s costs submissions dated 25 september 2020, viz, gol would be liable for above-cap fees “if awarded and collected by piercing the corporate veil” [emphasis added].

 in the investors’ view, the tribunal should have therefore rejected this belated assertion, or alternatively, indicated that it intended to accept or rely on that assertion and request for an additional response from the investors. these the tribunal did not do, and they were taken by surprise when the tribunal accepted gol’s belated assertion without having parties address it on this issue.

 in reply, the investors contend that gol’s belated assertion was made so late in the proceedings that until the award was issued, there was no way of knowing whether the tribunal had accepted that assertion. hence, the duty to object to any failure of process or give fair intimation to the tribunal did not arise.

 this prompted a response from the gol parties, who contend that gol’s fee arrangement is not champertous and does not savour of maintenance. rather, it ensured that gol, which represent one of the world’s poorest sovereign states, had access to justice to defend itself against the investors’ legal proceedings.

 even if there were some uncertainty as to whether the gol costs order was permissible from a public policy standpoint, the gol parties submit that the degree and consequences of any potential violation would hardly shock the conscience, and the court, when weighing the pro-enforcement policy against the public policy allegedly violated, should give effect to the former.

28 as to their third ground, the investors complain that the gol costs order obliged the investors to bear a part of gol’s fees which had not been incurred by gol. this is allegedly contrary to parties’ agreed arbitral procedure as encapsulated in r 37 of the siac rules of the singapore international arbitration centre (6th edition, 1 august 2016) (the “siac rules”). rule 37 only permits the tribunal to order that the legal or other costs which have been incurred by a party be paid by another party, and according to the investors, that means that the tribunal can only order costs which the former party has incurred a liability or obligation to pay.

 even if the investors’ interpretation of r 37 of the siac rule were correct, the gol costs order would not be contrary to r 37. the tribunal was correct in finding that gol had incurred all the costs awarded in the gol costs order, and the investors cannot reopen the tribunal’s factual ruling on its merits.

 in response to this particular point, the investors claim that the language of article 36(1)(a)(iv) of the model law makes it plain that the court must come to its own view on whether the arbitral procedure was in accordance with the parties’ agreement, and this entails considering whether costs claimed by gol have in fact been incurred. the investors also remark that it would be illogical for this court to not be able to review the tribunal’s findings of fact made in the course of applying the agreed procedure: if this were the case, procedural challenges would virtually never succeed since the courts would have to mechanically defer to the tribunals’ application of the procedural rules.

issues to be determined 31 therefore, the issues which the present applications raise are:(a) in relation to the estopped claims:(i) whether there was a breach of natural justice in that the investors were not heard on the merits of their estopped claims against sm and gass because of the tribunal’s findings on collateral estoppel; and(ii) whether the award was in conflict with singapore’s public policy of access to justice, given that the investors were not heard on the merits of their estopped claims against sm and gass;(b) in relation to the gol costs order:(i) whether there was a breach of natural justice arising from the tribunal’s reliance on the clarification of gol’s fee arrangement only in the gol parties’ reply costs submissions;(ii) whether the enforcement of the gol costs order would be contrary to the laws and public policy of singapore against maintenance and champerty;(iii) whether the gol costs order was contrary to parties’ agreed arbitral procedure; and(iv) whether the tribunal exceeded the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration by awarding costs that have not been incurred by gol in the gol costs order.issue a1: whether there was a breach of natural justice in that the investors were not heard on the merits of their estopped claims against sm and gass because of the tribunal’s findings on collateral estoppel 32 under s 24(b) of the iaa, an arbitration award may be set aside if a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award, by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced. as set out by the court of appeal in soh beng tee & co pte ltd v fairmount development pte ltd [2007] 3 slr(r) 86 at [29], the party who challenges the award on this ground must: (a) identify the rule of natural justice which was breached; (b) establish how the rule was breached; (c) establish the way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) show that the breach prejudiced its rights. the rule said to have been breached in the present case is the right to be heard. this right requires each party to have a “full opportunity” of presenting its case, subject to considerations of reasonableness and fairness. the result is that what constitutes “full opportunity” is a contextual inquiry of whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair, and the approach a court should take is to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done: china machine new energy corp v jaguar energy guatemala llc and another [2020] 1 slr 695 at [104].33 in light of the foregoing principles, it is evident to us that the investors’ respective rights to be heard were not breached in the manner alleged. we elaborate.34 the tribunal did not examine the merits of the investors’ estopped claims because it held that those claims were precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel under new york law, a defence which was raised by the gol parties and contested by the investors during the arbitral proceedings. collateral estoppel in new york law is a similar doctrine to that of issue estoppel in singapore law. as the tribunal noted,

 parties were in partial agreement concerning its nature, reach and effect:the parties agree that, under new york law, collateral estoppel is substantive in nature. the parties also appear to agree that collateral estoppel prevents “re-litigation of an issue of law or fact that was raised, litigated, and actually decided by a judgment in a prior proceeding between the parties […] regardless of whether or not the two proceedings are based on the same claim”. the tribunal finds that these propositions accurately reflect new york law.35  the principal point of difference on the legal position under new york law concerned whether and how it applied to entities that were not directly parties to the earlier litigation.

as recounted in the procedural history, [sm] and [gass] presented a preclusion chart seeking to show the identity between the issues in the prior siac arbitration and those in this arbitration. the [investors] inserted their comments into the same chart, to which [sm and gass] replied, after which the completed preclusion chart was filed on 28 august 2020. an examination of this chart reveals that the issues before this tribunal are identical (identity being understood in the manner just described) to those before the prior siac arbitration. the content of the chart is discussed below.38 it can be seen then that the tribunal made determinations of law and fact in relation to a doctrine of substantive law under the governing law, namely new york law. it was these determinations that in turn led to the conclusion that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied so as to preclude the investors from arguing the merits of the estopped claims.39 this is very different from a tribunal mistaking its procedural powers or the scope of issues in play before it, and on the basis of such a mistake either proceeding to an award without hearing one party or excluding evidence. it is instead the tribunal doing what it was tasked to do, namely, to determine the dispute referred to it, including determining the application of any preclusionary or exclusionary doctrines raised by a party before it. whether the tribunal made an error of law or fact in its decision that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied goes only to the merits, and cannot found a challenge to the award.40 at this juncture, we reiterate the well-settled position that curial intervention in arbitral proceedings is generally limited to process failures and does not extend to a merits-based review of the award. it has been said time and again that courts must resist the temptation to engage with what is substantially an attack on the merits of an award, but which may be disguised or presented as a challenge to process failures: see akn and another v alc and others and other appeals [2015] 3 slr 488 at [37]–[39] and blc and others v blb and another [2014] 4 slr 79 at [3]–[4]. in support of their case that this court is entitled to review the tribunal’s reasoning, the investors brought our attention to aju v ajt [2011] 4 slr 739 at [65] and beijing sinozonto mining investment co ltd v goldenray consortium (singapore) pte ltd [2014] 1 slr 814 at [52].

 but these cases in fact reinforce this general principle on the limited extent of curial intervention.41 we agree with the investors that when dealing with an allegation of a breach of natural justice of the type in question, the court should inquire into the tribunal’s reasons for not addressing a pleaded issue which was at play (see above at [22]).

 however, in light of the general principle expounded above, where those reasons are premised on certain determinations of fact and law made by the tribunal, those determinations must be taken as they are unless they have been tainted by process failures. it is not open to the court to examine the correctness of those determinations. here, the tribunal’s reason for not dealing with the investors’ estopped claims is that they have been precluded by the new york doctrine of collateral estoppel, a finding underpinned by various factual and legal determinations made by the tribunal. the investors are not alleging that they have not been heard on the collateral estoppel issue.

 the applicability of this doctrine therefore supplies a proper and reasonable basis for the tribunal to not address the merits of the estopped claims.42 finally, the mere fact that the investors were precluded by the collateral estoppel doctrine from advancing the estopped claims cannot found a natural justice challenge. in this connection, both counsel addressed the court on the recent court of appeal decision in btn.

 that case concerned an award in which the tribunal had determined that res judicata applied in relation to findings of the malaysian industrial court (“mic”) which therefore bound parties in relation to the dispute in arbitration (at [33]). the court of appeal, at [1], made the following opening observation:… in brief, the appellants are aggrieved because the arbitral tribunal before which they appeared held that they were prevented by the doctrine of res judicata from litigating on a vital component of their defence to the respondents’ claim in the arbitration. they say there is nothing more repugnant to the most basic notions of justice than to deny it to one party. that may be so, but whether “denial of justice” is an appropriate way in which to label what happened in the arbitration proceedings is another matter. litigants affected adversely by the application of the res judicata doctrine, a long-established common law doctrine, often consider themselves to have been unfairly deprived of their right to a hearing.43 in btn, it was first argued unsuccessfully that there was a breach of justice concerning the hearing on the res judicata issue, for example whether the tribunal had based its decision on res judicata on factual matters even though parties had agreed that disputed matters of fact would not be taken into account by the tribunal (at [44]). the challenge has not been mounted in this way in the present case, and the investors have confirmed that it is not their case that they were not heard on the collateral estoppel defence.

 the investors do not raise any denial of justice in how the issue of possible preclusion was heard and determined. rather the investors contend that the fact of preclusion gives rise to the breach of natural justice. there is no merit in this argument. the invocation of any preclusionary doctrine means that a party will not be heard on the aspects of the case that it is precluded from re-opening. such doctrines serve the cause of justice by promoting finality in litigation, and their existence not only in singapore law but in many if not most legal systems demonstrates that they are not in and of themselves objectionable. 44 public policy was also raised in btn and likewise in the present case. we now turn to that ground of challenge.issue a2: whether the award was in conflict with singapore’s public policy of access to justice, given that the investors were not heard on the merits of their estopped claims against sm and gass 45  it is helpful to start with btn. in introducing the public policy challenge in that matter, the court of appeal explained, at [56]:the public policy ground for setting aside provided by art 34(2) of the model law is a narrow one. this court has held that the ground should only succeed in cases where upholding or enforcing the arbitral award would “shock the conscience”, or be “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public”, or violate “the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice”: pt asuransi jasa indonesia (persero) v dexia bank sa [2007] 1 slr(r) 597 (“pt asuransi”) at [59]. in this respect, we reiterate that the doctrine of res judicata has long been part of the law of singapore and its invocation in cases brought in the singapore courts is not unusual. accordingly, a decision based on res judicata principles can never in itself be described as shocking the conscience or wholly offensive to informed members of the public. recognising this, the appellants aim their attack at erroneous applications of the doctrine. importantly, however, the general principle is that even if an arbitral tribunal’s findings of law and/or fact are wrong, such errors would not per se engage the public policy of singapore: aju v ajt [2011] 4 slr 739 at [66]; pt asuransi at [57].46 thus, an award that is made based on res judicata principles is not for that reason contrary to public policy. the appellants in btn raised two arguments why the award in that case contravened public policy. the first rested on the premise that they had not been aware of the mic proceedings (at [57(a)]). the second rested on the claim that the respondents had breached the arbitration agreement by instituting the proceedings before the mic (at [57(b)]). first of all, the court of appeal was not persuaded on the facts, noting at [59] that the appellants have been served with eight notices relating to the mic proceedings and at [63] that they had neither commenced arbitration proceedings themselves nor sought to restrain the mic proceedings.47 the court of appeal went further, however, at [72] and [73], and held that even an erroneous ruling of res judicata would not found a challenge to the award on the basis of public policy. such errors are not to be treated any differently from other errors that a tribunal might make on the merits of the case before it.48 the investors seek to distinguish btn on the ground that they had not had the opportunity to pursue their claims against sm and gass in the prior siac arbitration, as they were unable to join them without their consent. they point out that the declaration filed by gass in the delaware action does not contain a specific consent to be joined to the prior siac arbitration,

 49 the investors’ argument conflates two distinct doctrines, namely collateral estoppel under new york law and the rule in henderson v henderson under singapore law. they have different requirements. the tribunal was tasked to decide what the requirements were under each of the doctrines and whether those requirements had been fulfilled. not only was it within the tribunal’s purview to decide that it was not a condition for the application of collateral estoppel that the claims against sm and gass could have been brought in the prior siac arbitration, the investors never argued that it was.50 further, while it is true that the investors did not have the opportunity to pursue their claims against sm and gass, this is beside the point. the collateral estoppel that the tribunal accepted concerned issues common to the prior siac arbitration and to the dispute before it, as shown by the preclusion chart. the investors had had the opportunity to run their case regarding those common issues in the prior siac arbitration. the effect of the finding of collateral estoppel was that the investors could not reopen those matters, and this finding was based on the tribunal’s view that sm and gass were gol’s privies for this purpose. thus, the investors did argue those common issues, but only once, ie in the prior siac arbitration. there is nothing repugnant about their not being allowed to argue the same issues a second time. issue b1: whether there was a breach of natural justice arising from the tribunal’s reliance on the clarification of gol’s fee arrangement only in the gol parties’ reply costs submissions51  to recap, the investors say that they were taken by surprise when the tribunal accepted the clarification in the gol parties’ reply costs submissions that its obligation to pay costs over a certain fee cap was triggered so long as costs were awarded in their favour and there was no need for such costs to actually be collected. they complain that they did not have the opportunity to address this clarification made in gol parties’ reply costs submissions.52 the first difficulty in the investors’ argument is that the issues of how much costs should be awarded and whether any award was to be limited by reason of funding arrangements were in play.

 the tribunal afforded parties the opportunity to exchange two rounds of submissions (see above at [14]). it is not unexpected for reply submissions to clarify or refine a party’s position. upon receipt of the gol parties’ reply costs submissions, the investors did not raise any issue about this allegedly belated assertion, make any request for disclosure or seek any further round of submissions.53 secondly, and more fundamentally, the investors have not fairly represented the tribunal’s decision on this point. in fact, the tribunal noted that gol’s fee arrangement remained unclear, and included this lack of clarity as one of the factors that it bore in mind in allocating only 60% of the costs.

 thus, it is not even correct that the tribunal simply accepted what was said in the gol parties’ reply costs submissions at face value. for the same reason, it cannot be said that the alleged breach of natural justice had prejudiced the investors.issue b2: whether the enforcement of the gol costs order would be contrary to the laws and public policy of singapore against maintenance and champerty54  the investors urge the court to find on the evidence before us that gol’s fee arrangement is champertous and savours of maintenance. first, we do not accept that the concepts of champerty or maintenance are engaged by an agreement between a defendant and its lawyer that the defendant need only pay the lawyer’s costs above a certain fee cap to the extent that that defendant succeeded in its defence and obtained a costs order in its favour. champerty and maintenance concern intermeddling that encourages lawsuits by financing them, and are not engaged where defence of a lawsuit is concerned. 55 secondly, the arrangement as described is in form much like a conditional fee arrangement. such arrangements are now permitted even for singapore lawyers representing parties in international arbitrations: ss 115a(1) and 115b(1) of the legal profession act 1966 (2020 rev ed) read with reg 3(a) of the legal profession (conditional fee agreement) regulations 2022. at the second reading of the legal profession (amendment) bill on 12 january 2022, the second minister for law, mr edwin tong chun fai, noted that conditional fee arrangements “can also enhance access to justice”, and “can also discourage the pursuit of weak cases and frivolous claims”: singapore parliamentary debates, official report (12 january 2022), vol 95 (edwin tong chun fai, second minister for law).56 it must be kept in mind that the tribunal did not award an amount of costs that could by any measure be considered exorbitant, or not in keeping with the scope and scale of legal work done for the arbitration. we do not accept that gol’s fee arrangement shocks the conscience or is otherwise contrary to public policy.issue b3: whether the gol costs order was contrary to parties’ agreed arbitral procedure57  this issue turns on whether the gol costs order did not fall within the tribunal’s “authority to order in its award that all or a part of the legal or other costs of a party be paid by another party”: rule 37 of the siac rules.58 the investors argue that the costs of a party must be costs that it has incurred in the sense of being obliged to pay. they say that to the extent that gol was not obliged to pay costs above the fee cap then those excess costs could not be awarded by the tribunal. 59 the parties agreed on the application of the siac rules. the tribunal did not disregard the siac rules but followed those rules on the basis of its interpretation of them and its views and findings on the evidence before it. we do not agree that siac rules rule 37 is limited in the way contended for by the investors. gol engaged lawyers who incurred time in its defence. the value of that time spent forms part of gol’s costs and so comes within rule 37. rule 37 vests arbitrators with a broad discretion to allocate and award costs.issue b4: whether the tribunal exceeded the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration by awarding costs that have not been incurred by gol in the gol costs order60  this issue also depends on the investors’ interpretation of rule 37 as outlined in the preceding issue. we do not accept the investors’ interpretation and thus reject the investors’ contention under this head as well.conclusion 61 we dismiss os 7 and sum 5882. parties are to file written submissions on costs limited to ten pages each, and unless either party requests an oral hearing we will proceed to fix and award costs based on those written submissions.philip jeyaretnamjudge of the high courtsir vivian ramseyinternational judgedouglas jones aointernational judgelin weiqi wendy, chong wan yee monica (zhang wanyu), leau jun li (wongpartnership llp) for the plaintiffs in originating summons no 7 of 2022 and applicants in summons no 5882 of 2021;lim gerui, tan yuan kheng (chen yuanqing) and tan sih si (chen shisi) (drew & napier llc) for the defendants in originating summons no 7 of 2022 and respondents in summons no 5882 of 2021.
