  statement of claim dated 7 august 2020 (“soc”) at pp 9-10. 



(a) trade mark infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the trade marks act (cap 332, 2005 rev ed) (“the tma”) for using marks that are similar with the plaintiffs’ trade mark in respect of identical services for which that trade mark was registered;(b) passing off, with the plaintiffs asserting that “luke’s” is their distinctive name; and(c) a declaration that the luke’s lobster trade marks are invalid pursuant to s 23 of the tma on the basis that they were registered in breach of ss 8(2)(b) and/or 8(7) of the tma because there is passing off in respect of “lukes” [sic].19 besides the declaration of invalidity in [18(c)] above, the plaintiffs seek:(a) an injunction to restrain the defendants from using any sign that incorporates the word “luke’s” for goods and services identical or similar to those for which the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark is registered;(b) an inquiry as to damages or alternatively, at the plaintiffs’ option, an account of profits; and(c) an order for the delivery up or destruction upon oath of all infringing material in the defendants’ possession, power, custody or control.20 i will first address the claim for trade mark infringement (see [21] below), then the claim for passing off (see [120] below), and finally whether the luke’s lobster trade marks are invalid (see [179] below).are the defendants liable for trade mark infringement?analytical framework21 section 27(2) of the tma provides as follows:a person infringes a registered trade mark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course of trade a sign where because —(a) the sign is identical with the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services similar to those for which the trade mark is registered; or (b) the sign is similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the trade mark is registered,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.22 whether there is infringement under s 27(2) of the tma is assessed by the step-by-step approach (the polo/lauren co, lp v shop-in department store pte ltd [2006] 2 slr(r) 690 (“polo”) at [8]):first the alleged offending sign must be shown to be similar to the registered mark. second, both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar goods or services. third, on account of the presence of the first two conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.23 in staywell hospitality group pty ltd v starwood hotels & resorts worldwide, inc and another and another appeal [2014] 1 slr 911 (“staywell (ca)”), the court of appeal explained (at [15]):… the only relevant type of confusion for the purpose of grounding an opposition or an infringement action, is that which is brought about by the similarity between the competing marks and between the goods and services in relation to which the marks are used … under the step-by-step approach, the three requirements of similarity of marks, similarity of goods or services, and likelihood of confusion arising from the two similarities, are assessed systematically. the first two elements are assessed individually before the final element which is assessed in the round.[emphasis in original]24 in comparing the marks, the court will consider visual, phonetic (or aural), and conceptual similarity (han’s ([3] above) at [105]). this is done mark-for-mark without consideration of any external matter (han’s at [105]; staywell (ca) at [20]).25 distinctiveness is a factor integrated into the visual, aural and conceptual analysis of the marks (staywell (ca) at [30]). distinctiveness in the ordinary and non-technical sense refers to what is outstanding and memorable about the mark; distinctiveness in the technical sense is contrasted with descriptiveness (staywell (ca) at [23]-[24]). in staywell (ca), the court found that, at least in relation to hotels and hospitality services, “regis” enjoys a substantial degree of technical distinctiveness, and there was a high degree of aural similarity between the competing “st regis” and “park regis” marks because of the distinctiveness of the common “regis” component in both the technical and non-technical senses (at [31]).26 the plaintiffs similarly contend that “luke’s” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark was, by itself, distinctive of their restaurants. thus, they argue that the luke’s lobster trade marks (both of which have the word “luke’s”) are similar to the plaintiffs’ trade mark, indeed confusingly so. i address this below.similarity of marksvisual similarity of marks27 the plaintiffs contend that here, the dominant and distinctive component of the marks is the word “luke’s” – that is the most visually noticeable and memorable part of the marks:

  plaintiffs’ closing submissions (“pcs”) at para 161. 



(a) in the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark, the word “luke’s” is at the top, in a font that is twice the size of the words “oyster bar” and “chop house”, and about three times the size of the words “travis masiero restaurant group”; and (b) in the luke’s lobster trade marks, “luke’s” is coupled with “lobster” (either as a word or as a lobster device).28 “luke’s” is, however, not the only word in the plaintiffs’ mark. the plaintiff did not register “luke’s” as a trade mark and then use that for restaurants named “luke’s oyster bar & chop house”. instead, the plaintiffs registered a trade mark with nine words: luke’s / oyster bar / chop house / travis masiero restaurant group. 29 in ozone community corp v advance magazine publishers inc [2010] 2 slr 459 (“ozone”), the high court held that the “glamour” and “hysteric glamour” marks were visually dissimilar (and also aurally dissimilar) (at [53] and [56]). in determining the visual similarity of the marks, the court considered the length of the marks, the structure of the marks (ie, whether there are the same number of words), and whether the same letters are used in the marks (at [49]).30 similarly, in taylor ([3] above), the assistant registrar of trade marks found that the “taylor’s” and “taylors wakefield” marks were not visually similar (at [73]).31 so, too, the court of appeal found in polo ([22] above) that the  mark was not similar to the “polo” word mark. the court said (at [24]): bearing in mind that ‘polo’ is a common english word, we are unable to see how it could be said that the sign ‘polo pacific’ with its special font and design is similar to the mark ‘polo’ except in the broadest of sense that one word is common.32 here, the plaintiffs’ trade mark consists of – luke’s / oyster bar / chop house / travis masiero restaurant group: nine words, 51 letters (see [5] above). on the other hand, the luke’s lobster word mark has two words, 12 letters; the luke’s lobster logo has one word, five letters, and a lobster device (see [11] above).33 there are also differences in font, and design. the fonts and typefaces of the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark and luke’s lobster trade marks are noticeably different (see [61] below). in terms of design, the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark is made up almost exclusively of words (save for a separator between “oyster bar” and “chop house”), while the luke’s lobster logo is represented by both a word (“luke’s”) and a lobster device. unlike the luke’s lobster word mark, which is a simple word mark representing “luke’s lobster” in a single file, the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark is a composite mark comprising “luke’s”, “oyster bar”, “chop house” and “travis masiero restaurant group” occupying their respective positions within the mark. the comparison is:as compared toand.34 such differences were also noted in several other cases where the marks were found to be dissimilar:(a) in valentino globe bv v pacific rim industries inc [2010] 2 slr 1203 (“valentino (ca)”), between the opponent’s marks and , and the applicant’s mark  ;(b) in discovery communications, llc v a-star-education discovery camps pte ltd [2020] sgipos 4, between the opponent’s mark and the applicant’s mark ; and (c) in han’s ([3] above), where the court held that the han cuisine of naniwa sign   (“han sign”) was similar to the han’s word marks  but dissimilar to the han’s composite marks . the court found that the han sign had visual similarity with the han’s word marks but not with the han’s composite marks, phonetic similarity with all four of the han’s marks, but was conceptually dissimilar to all of the han’s marks (particularly with the han’s composite marks) (at [122]–[143]). in the event, the court found that although the han sign was similar to the han’s word marks, it was not confusingly so (at [183]).35  these cases may be contrasted with staywell (ca) ([23] above), where the court of appeal found that staywell’s mark was similar to starwood’s “st. regis” word mark (at [38]).36 in all the above cases, there was some common element between the marks: “glamour”, “taylor”, “polo”, “valentino”, “discovery”, “han”, “regis”, but the competing marks were only found to be similar overall in han’s (in respect of the word marks) and staywell (ca) (comparing “park regis” to “st regis”).37 as for the plaintiffs’ contention that “luke’s” per se is distinctive of their restaurants, case law indicates that a commonly used personal name (like “luke”) is considered of low distinctiveness:(a) in taylor ([3] above), there was evidence that it was used as the trading name of a number of live businesses in singapore (at [52]);(b) in kenzo ([3] above), that was likewise noted in relation to “kenzo” and the principal assistant registrar of trade marks moreover stated that the average member of the public is equally likely to construe the word “kenzo” as a personal name of japanese origin, as much as a sign that may serve as a badge of origin (at [40]).(c) in luciano sandrone v european union intellectual property office (case t-268/18), the european general court compared the “don luciano” and “luciano sandrone” marks, and concluded that as the first name “luciano” was a common first name in spain, italy, portugal and france (at [74]), there was only a weak degree of visual and phonetic similarity between the competing marks (at [78] and [80]), and no likelihood of confusion (at [92]-[103]).38 in singapore, the words “luke”, “luke’s” and “lukes” are found in the registered trading names of various entities:

41 in reed executive plc and another v reed business information ltd and others [2004] etmr 56 (“reed”), the plaintiff’s registered mark was “reed”, registered for employment agency services, whereas the defendant’s sign was “reed business information”. the english court of appeal observed that “reed” is a common surname, and the additional words “business information” in the defendant’s sign would be recognised by the average consumer as serving to differentiate the defendant from reeds in general (at [37]-[38]). indeed, the court considered the additional words “as prominent as the word ‘reed’” (at [39]). in the event, the court found there was no likelihood of confusion (at [105]-[106]).42 the court, citing lord simonds in office cleaning services v westminster window and general cleaning (1946) 63 rpc 30 (at 43), stated that “where a mark is largely descriptive ‘small differences may suffice’ to avoid confusion” (at [84]). in that cited case, “office cleaning association” was sufficiently different from “office cleaning services” to avoid passing off (at [85]). the court went on to say (at [86]): the same sort of consideration applies when there is use of two common surnames, as in this case. the average consumer will be alert for differences – just in the same way as one distinguishes wh smith from other smiths by the initials.43 the plaintiffs’ trade mark is not “luke’s”, it is: “luke’s / oyster bar / chop house / travis masiero restaurant group” [emphasis added]. neither are the luke lobster trade marks just “luke’s”: they are “luke’s lobster” [emphasis added], with “lobster” either in word form, or graphically depicted by the lobster device. adopting the english court of appeal’s reasoning in reed, the words “oyster bar” “chop house” and “travis masiero restaurant group” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark serve to differentiate the plaintiffs’ restaurants from other “luke’s” establishments, as does the word “lobster” or the lobster device in the respective luke’s lobster trade marks.44 the risk inherent in the use of a name in a trade mark, was well noted by the ip adjudicator professor david llewelyn in valentino spa v matsuda & co [2020] sgipos 8 (at [1]):where a business chooses as its trade mark (or one of its trade marks) a name, whether a given name, a surname or a combination of the two, that choice comes with a risk: that others may be able to use it (or them) in good faith without impinging upon the trade mark owner’s rights, including the right to successfully oppose subsequent third party applications to register another combination as a trade mark. the more common the name, the more likely this is: for example, wang would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to protect as a trade mark for fashion articles except in combination with a given name such as alexander or vera; as would choo without jimmy or lim without phillip. likewise, to take some examples from further afield: smith without paul; ralph without lauren; klein without calvin or ann; louis without vuitton.45 the words besides “luke’s” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark serve to differentiate them from “luke’s” per se, in much the same way as adding a surname to “luke” or “luke’s”, eg “luke masiero” or “luke masiero’s”.46 the words “oyster bar”, “chop house” and “travis masiero restaurant group” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark contribute to the mark as a whole being distinctive of the plaintiffs’ restaurants. which “luke’s” are they? they are the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants that are part of the travis masiero restaurant group. having chosen to differentiate themselves in that way, it is ironic that the plaintiffs now seek to focus on “luke’s”, and to downplay the rest of their trade mark.47 in effect, the plaintiffs are claiming a monopoly over “luke’s” – at least in relation to restaurants.48 such an assertion was roundly rejected in valentino (hc) ([3] above) where the high court said (at [36]), “[t]he appellant certainly does not have a monopoly over the word ‘valentino’”; and in valentino (ca) ([34(a)] above), where the court of appeal said (at [22]):… the allegation that the respondent had hijacked the appellant’s valentino marks because the application mark contained the same word ‘valentino’, was a non sequitur and had absolutely no merit and we do not think there is any further need to address it. this assertion would amount to saying that the appellant had a proprietary claim to a common name such as ‘valentino’.49 i likewise reject the plaintiffs’ attempt to claim a monopoly over “luke’s”.50 i find that the luke’s lobster trade marks are not visually similar to the plaintiffs’ luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark, and that the luke’s lobster logo is particularly dissimilar.phonetic/aural similarity of marks51 the plaintiffs submit that aurally, the marks are virtually identical. i do not agree.

52 in staywell (ca) ([23] above), the court of appeal noted that one approach would be to undertake a quantitative assessment as to whether the competing marks have more syllables in common than not, which was the approach taken in ozone ([29] above) (at [55]) – on that approach, “st regis” and “park regis” had more syllables in common than not, two out of three (at [32]).53 the other approach, which the high court judge adopted in staywell hospitality group pty ltd v starwood hotels & resorts worldwide, inc and another [2013] 1 slr 489 (“staywell (hc)”), was to consider if the marks have a dominant and distinctive component when each is read out (at [22]-[23]). the judge found that that was “regis”, while “st” and “park” were not as dominant, but not to be ignored (at [24]). the court of appeal upheld the finding that the marks were aurally similar (staywell (ca) at [33]).54 here, the plaintiffs’ trade mark has 15 syllables; the luke’s lobster word mark has three syllables, and the luke’s lobster logo has one syllable. only one syllable is common between the competing marks: “luke’s”. moreover, “luke’s” is of low distinctiveness (see [37]-[40] above).55 this case is very different from wagamama ltd v city centre restaurants plc and another [1995] fsr 713 (“wagamama”) where wagamama ltd sued for trade mark infringement and passing off, the comparison being between its “wagamama” restaurant, and the defendant’s subsequent restaurant “rajamama”. as the court noted, “wagamama” means selfishness or wilfulness in japanese, but it was not in dispute between the parties that the word has no meaning to the overwhelming majority of the population in england (at 717). as such, a significant section of them would regard it as an entirely artificial and meaningless mark (at 732). an artificial mark has greater distinctiveness in the technical sense (see staywell (ca) at [24]). moreover, in wagamama, the court noted that much of the plaintiff’s business is likely to come from oral recommendation, and as such the possibility of confusion and imperfect recollection are significant (at 736). in the event, the plaintiff succeeded in both its trade mark infringement and passing off claims (at 733 and 737). in the present case, “luke’s” (which per se is of low distinctiveness: see [37]-[40] above) does not have the technical distinctiveness of a word like “wagamama”, and there was no evidence that much of the plaintiffs’ business is likely to come from oral recommendation.56 i find that the luke’s lobster trade marks are not phonetically (or aurally) similar to the plaintiffs’ trade mark.conceptual similarity of marks57 the plaintiffs submit that the marks have a high degree of conceptual similarity given that they both denote a food and beverage establishment owned by a person called “luke” (due to the use of “luke’s”), and both lobsters and oysters are seafood.

 that is an over-simplification.58 in considering conceptual similarity, the court “seeks to uncover the ideas that lie behind and inform the understanding of the mark as a whole” (staywell (ca) ([23] above) at [35]).59 here, the phrases “oyster bar” and “chop house” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark bring to mind a place, just like “kenzo estate” in kenzo ([3] above) (at [36]-[37]). the luke’s lobster trade marks, on the other hand, bring to mind an animal (the lobster), or a type of food (lobster), rather than a place. while a “lobster shack” (see [8] above) would be the equivalent of an “oyster bar”, here, the luke’s lobster trade marks simply state “luke’s ‘lobster’” (in word or by the lobster device).60 the phrase “travis masiero restaurant group” in the plaintiffs’ trade mark indicates that the plaintiffs’ luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants are part of a larger group – the travis masiero restaurant group. moreover, the restaurant group bears the name “travis masiero” rather than “luke’s” or “luke’s oyster bar & chop house”. the luke’s lobster trade marks, on the other hand, make no reference to any restaurant group, or any person other than the eponymous “luke”.61 further, the words in the plaintiffs’ trade mark are all in capital letters, upright, and in gold typeface. the impression given is one of formality and sophistication (see han’s ([3] above) where the same observation was made about the han sign (see [34(c)] above) (at [142])). in contrast, the luke’s lobster word mark only has the initials “l” capitalised. “luke’s” in the luke’s lobster logo is curved, with the word forming the body of the lobster, and “lobster” is conveyed by a lobster device rather than a word. the luke’s lobster trade marks come across as casual, even playful (especially the luke’s lobster logo).62 i find that the marks are conceptually dissimilar.overall similarity of marks63 as discussed above, i consider the marks to be visually dissimilar, phonetically (or aurally) dissimilar, and conceptually dissimilar. on the whole, the luke’s lobster trade marks are dissimilar to the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark, and the luke’s lobster logo especially dissimilar.similarity of goods or services64 the marks are all registered in class 43 of the icgs. the plaintiffs’ registration is for (among others) “restaurants”; the defendants’ registrations are for “restaurants featuring lobster” and “restaurant services” (see [5] and [11] above).65 in staywell (ca) ([23] above)), the court of appeal stated that registration in the same specification within a class establishes a prima facie case for identity (at [40]). in this regard, i accept that the luke’s lobster trade marks are used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the plaintiffs’ trade mark is registered.66 this does not mean there is no distinction between the defendants’ luke’s lobster shacks and the plaintiffs’ restaurants – there is (see [76], [79] and [132]-[140]). but these differences should more appropriately be considered when evaluating the likelihood of confusion. in staywell (ca), the court of appeal stated (at [61]):in infringement proceedings … [t]he only question is whether the actual use of a similar or identical sign by the infringer encroaches on the registered proprietor’s monopoly rights under s 26 of [the tma], to use the mark in relation to goods and services for which he is already using it as well as the penumbra of fair uses for which he might want to use it.67 that was, however, part of the discussion on likelihood of confusion, rather than in relation to the issue of similarity of services (on which the court had already concluded that the services were identical or similar: staywell (ca) at [42]-[43]).likelihood of confusionconsiderations of marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity68 the next question is whether there is likelihood of confusion arising from marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity (see [22]–[23] above). the plaintiffs accept that for trade mark infringement the likelihood of confusion must arise from marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity.

69 as i have found the defendants’ luke’s lobster trade marks to be dissimilar from the plaintiffs’ luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark, strictly speaking, the question of confusion does not arise, as the court of appeal observed in polo ([22] above) (at [25]). but even if there is similarity of marks, and similarity of goods or services, it does not necessarily follow that confusion will automatically arise. a broader approach is appropriate to determine if there is confusion.70 the confusion analysis is, however, relevant to the passing off claim, and so i consider if there is likelihood of confusion, assuming that the luke’s lobster trade marks are regarded as similar to the plaintiffs’ trade mark. nevertheless, if there is only a low degree of similarity between the marks, the likelihood of confusion would be low (see staywell (ca) at [96(a)]).71 what needs to be established is a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the goods or services in question – that extends to the situation where the average consumer mistakenly assumes some kind of economic link or connection between the goods or services of the opposing parties (hai tong co (pte) ltd v ventree singapore pte ltd [2013] 2 slr 941 (“hai tong”) at [73]–[74]). the likelihood of confusion required is that which is to be expected amongst a substantial portion of the relevant segment of the public – that does not need to amount to a majority, but it must go beyond a “de minimis” level (hai tong at [78(e)]).72 “initial interest confusion” does not constitute “confusion” for the purposes of ss 8(2) and 27(2) of the tma. as the court of appeal stated in staywell (ca) ([23] above) (at [113]): if a consumer is initially confused but this is unlikely to persist to the point of purchase because of a lack of sufficient similarity in the marks or the goods then the purpose of the trade mark as a ‘badge of origin’ has not been undermined. 73 in the case of restaurants, the relevant time for evaluating confusion is thus the point of purchase.74 in staywell (ca), the court of appeal provided a non-exhaustive list of factors which would be admissible in the confusion inquiry (at [96(a)]-[96(b)]):(a) factors relating to the impact of marks-similarity on consumer perception: the degree of similarity of the marks themselves, the reputation of the marks, the impression given by the marks, and the possibility of imperfect recollection of the marks. the greater the similarity between the marks, the greater the likelihood of confusion.(b) factors relating to the impact of goods-similarity on consumer perception: factors concerning the very nature of the goods without implicating any steps that are taken by the trader to differentiate the goods. this includes the normal way in or the circumstances under which consumers would purchase goods of that type, whether the products are expensive or inexpensive items, the nature of the goods and whether they would tend to command a greater or lesser degree of fastidiousness and attention on the part of prospective purchasers, and the likely characteristics of the relevant consumers and whether they would or would not tend to apply care or have specialist knowledge in making the purchase.75 in relation to restaurants, the following discussion in han’s ([3] above) is instructive (at [162] and [175]) (see also [34(c)] above):162  both the plaintiff’s restaurants and the defendant’s restaurant are brick-and-mortar establishments. the visual and conceptual aspects of the marks in question will therefore have a significant impact on customers. potential patrons, who will be physically present at the establishments, will have direct perception of the respective marks as they are displayed. they will likely glance at the menu and the fare on offer, both of which are likely to be adorned by the respective marks, before deciding to patronise the establishment. phonetic similarity, while present, plays only a diminished role in assessing the likelihood of confusion. i have considered the three aspects of similarity above … and have concluded that there is conceptual dissimilarity and slight visual similarity between the [han’s marks] and the [han sign].…175  these three reasons lead me to conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion from the defendant’s use of the han sign. there is only slight visual similarity. the conceptual dissimilarity is manifest. further, the reputable han’s trade marks militate against confusion. the average consumer who approaches the defendant’s restaurant, and observes the han sign that is applied at various positions in and around the restaurant, would be disabused of any notion that there is an economic connection between the plaintiff’s goods and services and those of the defendant.76 in the present case, too, the plaintiffs’ restaurants and the defendants’ luke’s lobster shacks are brick-and-mortar establishments. the luke’s lobster trade marks are indeed prominently displayed at the defendants’ restaurants, as the following photographs show (with the locations of the luke’s lobster logo marked):

 interior of the plaintiffs’ restaurant at gemmill lane interior of the plaintiffs’ (now closed) restaurant at heeren80 in han’s ([3] above), the court noted that restaurant services embrace a broad range of different types of food outlets, and went on to hold that the significant differences in style, price, range and type of food and services offered are relevant in considering the likelihood of confusion - in that case, the plaintiff’s “han’s” restaurants were relatively inexpensive, whereas the defendant’s “han cuisine of naniwa” restaurant served fine dining japanese food (at [179]–[181]).81 in similar vein is the decision in doctor’s associates inc v lim eng wah (trading as subway niche) [2012] 3 slr 193 (“subway”), which pre-dated staywell (ca) ([23] above). subway concerned the international sandwich chain “subway” and the defendant’s “subway niche” stalls which sold nyonya kueh, bubble tea, and other local snacks. the court held that it had not been established that even a de minimis section of the public would be confused by the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s marks, which the court had found to be similar (at [41]),  and noted (at [51]):the pains taken by the defendant to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s weigh in strongly against the likelihood of any confusion. in particular, the sale, display and handing over of the sandwiches to customers differed … similarly, the prices of the sandwiches sold by the two parties differ significantly. finally, the defendant’s sandwiches are sold in the defendant’s outlets which employ a very different interior design scheme from that shared by the plaintiff’s subway outlets.82 given the mark-centric approach set out in staywell (ca) (at [96(a)]), for the inquiry into confusion for the purposes of trade mark infringement, i would first not factor in the significant differences in style, price, range and type of food and services in the present case. even so, i find that there is no likelihood of confusion, having regard to:(a) the non-similarity (or low similarity) of the marks (see [63] above);(b) the sparse use the plaintiffs made of their luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark (see [77] above), coupled with the plaintiffs’ restaurants not being known by many (see [78] above); and(c) some degree of fastidiousness and attention being expected on the part of prospective purchasers, in relation to restaurant services (see hai tong ([71] above) at [85(c)]).83 if i then took into account the significant differences in style, price, range and type of food and services in the present case (as the court did in han’s ([3] above)), that would only accentuate the differences between the plaintiffs’ restaurants and the defendants’ luke’s lobster shacks. i elaborate on this at [132]-[140] below.the plaintiffs’ survey evidence84 the plaintiffs relied heavily on the survey conducted by asian strategies, whose principal mr coops testified at trial (see [77] above).85 the court of appeal in sarika connoisseur café pte ltd v ferrero spa [2013] 1 slr 531 (“sarika (ca)”) stated, “[s]urvey evidence is relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant public”, but went on to agree with the high court judge that survey evidence should not be conclusive; rather it is only one factor in the global confusion analysis (at [64]).86 in determining the weight to be accorded to survey evidence, the high court in ferrero spa v sarika connoisseur cafe pte ltd [2011] sghc 176 (“sarika (hc)”) adopted guidelines from whitford j’s decision in imperial group ltd v philip morris & co [1984] rpc 293 (“the whitford guidelines”), which included (at [134]):(a) the interviewees in the survey must be selected so as to represent the relevant cross-section of the public;…(c) the survey must be conducted fairly;…(e) the totality of the answers given must be disclosed and made available to the defendant;(f) the questions must neither be leading, nor should they lead the person answering into a field of speculation he would never have embarked upon had the question not been put;…87 having regard to the whitford guidelines, there were a number of deficiencies in the plaintiffs’ survey evidence. in the event, i place no weight on the findings of the survey in so far as they are said to show a likelihood of confusion. that too was the fate of the survey in han’s ([3] above) (at [172]). my review of the plaintiffs’ survey evidence and its shortcomings is at [191]-[241] below.the plaintiffs’ evidence of actual confusion88 the plaintiffs rely not only on the survey as evidence of likelihood of confusion, they also say that statements made by some participants interviewed by mr coops for the survey show actual confusion.

i'm not saying look at what this so-and-so guy said about this and therefore this must be his opinion, that would be hearsay. we are saying look at what mr greg coops and his team and all the data analysts have done, this is the data and this is the proportion and that is admissible. so that is what we are going to rely on … [emphasis added]91 to rely on the unsworn statements of two of 266 interviewees, without calling them as witnesses, is indeed hearsay as the plaintiffs’ counsel had correctly recognised; it is not survey evidence. the plaintiffs’ evidence of actual confusion is open to the same criticisms levelled against similar evidence in subway ([81] above) (at [48] and [52]):48 the plaintiff identified some isolated instances of actual confusion by members of the public, though some of these instances constituted hearsay and consequently must be disregarded ……52 the evidence relied on by the plaintiff was deficient. the testimony given was vague and did not demonstrate that ‘not an insubstantial number’ of the public would be confused. the evidence described isolated incidents of individuals who were misled – no elaboration on the cause of the confusion or the extent of it or whether the individuals fit the archetypical ‘moron in a hurry’ mould was provided.92 in contrast, in wagamama ([55] above), eight customers actually gave evidence (at 715). here, none did.93 in any event, i do not accept that the verbatim comments the plaintiffs rely on show that those two interviewees had purchased food from the defendants’ luke’s lobster shack thinking that it was associated with the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants in some way.94 comment 14 states (among other things) “when i went there, the service was so bad that i realised it wasn’t lukes … [it was] like a fast-food place not a restaurant” [emphasis added].

 that does not show that the interviewee was confused when the purchase was made from the defendants’ luke’s lobster shack. the interviewee appears to have appreciated that the luke’s lobster shacks have a fast-food model, and what the service was like (and indeed, that it was distinct from the plaintiffs’ restaurants), before making a purchase. 95 comment 22 states, “i saw the sign [opening soon]. i thought ‘is this related to luke’s?’ i thought i’d try it. when i ate there and saw the flyer which said it was from new york i realised it’s not related [to luke’s].”

 that too does not show that a purchase was made before the interviewee saw the flyer and realised that the defendants’ luke’s lobster shack was not related to luke’s oyster bar & chop house. at best, it is ambivalent on the point, but the burden is on the plaintiffs to establish otherwise, and they never called that interviewee as a witness to testify to the incident.96 in so far as these two comments might show initial interest confusion, that is not sufficient for the plaintiffs’ purposes (see [72] above). if i were inclined to rely on those comments at all, they only show that from the visits to the defendants’ luke’s lobster shack, the interviewees had realised that luke lobster and the plaintiffs were unconnected; they did not only find this out when they participated in the survey.97 i turn now to the five emails and one facebook post which the plaintiffs rely on. again, none of the persons were called as witnesses, and their unsworn out-of-court statements are hearsay. in any event, the contents of the emails and facebook post do not assist the plaintiffs.98 there is first a 4 august 2020 email from one aaron of ink global to the plaintiffs asking for photographs for an article on the upcoming opening of luke’s lobster at isetan.

 on the plaintiffs’ reasoning, whilst at isetan, shaw house, j was confused in thinking that she was in multiple places at the same time: she was actually at luke’s lobster, isetan, but thought she was (a) across the road at ion orchard; (b) further away at marina bay; and (c) at one of the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants. on social media, one can even location tag a photograph of marina bay sands as “downtown chattanooga, tennessee” – but what would that mean?101 j’s facebook post is not good evidence of confusion at point of purchase, between luke’s oyster bar & chop house, and luke’s lobster. the plaintiffs did not call j as a witness; nor did they lead evidence to show that she was a customer of the plaintiffs’ restaurants, or that she even knew of luke’s oyster bar & chop house (other than as a location tag which she applied to one of her photos taken at luke’s lobster at isetan that day). one possible explanation is that she could simply have typed, “luke” (or “luke’s”) and picked “luke’s oyster bar & chop house” from various alternatives suggested by facebook.102 neither the survey evidence, nor the alleged evidence of actual confusion, is of much assistance to the plaintiffs on the issue of confusion. my decision is that the element of likelihood of confusion is not made out.the “own name” defence under s 28(1)(a) of the tma103 even if the plaintiffs had made out that the marks are similar, and that there is a likelihood of confusion, the “own name” defence under s 28(1)(a) of the tma stands to be considered.104 section 28(1) of the tma reads:notwithstanding section 27, a person does not infringe a registered trade mark when —(a)  he uses —(i)  his name or the name of his place of business; or(ii)  the name of his predecessor in business or the name of his predecessor’s place of business;(b)  he uses a sign to indicate —(i)  the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or other characteristic of goods or services; or(ii)  the time of production of goods or of the rendering of services; or(c)  he uses the trade mark to indicate the intended purpose of goods (in particular as accessories or spare parts) or services,and such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.105 in the audience motivation company asia pte ltd v amc live group china (s) pte ltd [2016] 3 slr 617 (“amc”), the court of appeal summarised the relevant principles to be applied when considering the applicability of the “own name” defence (at [65]–[66]) which included recognition that “[t]he defence is available in relation to the use of corporate names and this includes the use of the full company name as well as the defendant’s trading name” (at [65(b)]). i thus cannot accept the plaintiffs’ submission (citing premier luggage and bags ltd v premier co (uk) ltd [2003] fsr 5 (“premier luggage”) and asprey & garrard ltd v wra (guns) ltd [2002] fsr 31 (“asprey”)) that the defence is not available in relation to trading names.

 moreover, in hotel cipriani srl v cipriani (grosvenor street) ltd [2010] rpc 16 (“cipriani”), the english court of appeal, which accepted that the “own name” defence is available in relation to trading names (at [72]), had stated that premier luggage was not authority for the proposition that the defence was unavailable for trading names (at [65]) and that the decision in asprey had recognised that an established trading name might allow for successful use of the defence (at [67]). in that case, the defendant-company’s name was cipriani (grosvenor street) ltd (at [59]) but the court considered that it could rely on the defence in relation to its trading name, “cipriani london” if it established that such use was justified (at [73]).106 “luke’s lobster” is a trading name which the second defendant, lukes seafood llc, has used since 2009, two years prior to the opening of the first of the plaintiffs’ luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants in 2011 (see [4] and [8] above). in this regard, i would treat the luke’s lobster logo where “lobster” is conveyed by way of a lobster device rather than a word, as no different from the “luke’s lobster” word mark (where “lobster” is conveyed by words).107 i further accept that the second defendant’s use of “luke’s lobster” for its singapore lobster shacks is in accordance with the “honest practices” proviso to s 28 of the tma. not only did the use of the trade name “luke’s lobster” pre-date the opening of the plaintiffs’ luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants, “luke’s lobster” is named after its co-founder and ceo luke holden (“mr holden”) (in this regard, nothing turns on the use of the english “luke” rather the latin “lucas” which is formally mr holden’s first name (see [10] above),

(a) the first defendant’s ceo, vijay kumar s/o sreekumar pillai (“mr pillai”) had, for at least 10 years, known the plaintiffs’ directors mr masiero and jeremy muller (“mr muller”) (whose company, peccavi wines pte ltd, was also a shareholder of the plaintiffs);(b) in 2011 mr pillai had proposed to mr masiero to cooperate in a restaurant business;(c) mr pillai had over the years visited the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants at least 10 times, and must know that they serve seafood including lobsters;(d) mr pillai had referred to the plaintiffs’ restaurants as “luke’s” in a whatsapp message to mr muller; (e) the first defendant would have done all the necessary due diligence before bringing in a new brand – like luke’s lobster; and (f) mr pillai had intimate knowledge of the plaintiffs’ business and goodwill, and so it would be unfair of the first defendant as franchisee to be able to rely on the “own name” defence, even if the second defendant could do so.115 i do not agree with the plaintiffs’ contentions on this. the successful, and unopposed, registrations of the luke’s lobster trade marks in singapore would have indicated not only to the second defendant, but also to the first defendant and mr pillai, that luke’s lobster could likely open in singapore without issue. moreover, i do not believe mr pillai thought there was a likelihood of confusion between luke’s lobster, and luke’s oyster bar & chop house.the “registered mark” defence under s 28(3) of the tma116 section 28(3) of the tma reads:notwithstanding section 27, a registered trade mark is not infringed by the use of another registered trade mark in relation to goods or services for which the latter is registered.117 unless the registration of the luke’s lobster trade marks is declared invalid, the second defendant as the owner of the marks is entitled to use them, without that use being an infringement of the plaintiffs’ luke oyster bar & chop house trade mark; and the first defendant as the second defendant’s exclusive licensee is likewise entitled to the defence (as discussed at [113] above).118 i consider the plaintiffs’ claim for invalidity at [179] below.119 even without the “registered mark” defence, the plaintiffs’ trade mark infringement claim would fail for the reasons i have stated above, and i dismiss that claim.are the defendants liable for passing off?120 the tort of passing off requires proof of goodwill, misrepresentation, and damage: novelty pte ltd v amanresorts ltd and another [2009] 3 slr(r) 216 (“novelty”) at [36].goodwill121 i accept that the plaintiffs had goodwill in their luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurant business: there is an “attractive force that brings in custom”, ie customers to the restaurants (see novelty at [39], citing lord macnaghten in the commissioners of inland revenue v muller & co’s margarine limited [1901] ac 217 at 223–224).122 what is the get-up that is distinctive of the plaintiffs’ business? is it the name of the restaurants (“luke’s oyster bar & chop house”), the plaintiffs’ registered trade mark and unregistered logo, the plaintiffs’ food and beverage offerings, or some combination of these and perhaps other factors besides? the plaintiffs contend that “luke’s” by itself is distinctive of their business, but in my analysis of their trade mark infringement claim, i have already rejected that (see [43]-[46] above). the plaintiffs’ goodwill is not associated with “luke’s” simpliciter. rather, the plaintiffs’ restaurants are known as oyster bars and chop houses. “oyster bar” and “chop house” are not only in the name of the restaurants - “luke’s oyster bar & chop house” - but also in both the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark and the unregistered luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo. the plaintiffs’ goodwill is also associated with the travis masiero restaurant group (which is part of their trade mark), and restaurateur mr masiero (whose name is part of their logo).misrepresentation123 whether there is misrepresentation must be tested against what the plaintiffs’ restaurants’ goodwill is associated with, ie, not “luke’s”, but “luke’s oyster bar & chop house”, as part of the travis masiero restaurant group.124 as i have found in analysing the trade mark infringement claim, a personal name like “luke” (or its possessive form, “luke’s”) is of low distinctiveness, and the average consumer will be sensitive to additional words and/or features that accompany (and qualify) “luke’s”  (see [43] above): they would distinguish between the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark and the luke’s lobster trade marks.125 as the court in han’s ([3] above) noted, in a passing off claim (at [199]):   the court is entitled to take a broader view of the context within which the respective marks are employed in ascertaining whether a likelihood of confusion exists for the passing off tort. … the court is entitled to consider factors extraneous to the marks that would be impermissible in an action for infringement of a registered mark.126 in the present case, the less mark-centric the approach, the lower the likelihood of any misrepresentation or confusion, for there are many differences between the two sides.127 in assessing misrepresentation and confusion, i accept the defendants’ submission that initial interest confusion is insufficient for passing off, just as it is insufficient for the purposes of trade mark infringement.

 in law of intellectual property of singapore (sweet & maxwell, 2nd ed, 2014), the learned author professor ng-loy wee loon, sc (who had been the amicus curiae in staywell (ca) ([23] above)) stated that (at para 18.3.7): there can be no doubt that the appellate court intended this aspect of its decision [that the doctrine of initial interest confusion is not part of the law] to apply to the confusion inquiry arising under the trade marks act, as well as the confusion inquiry arising in the common law action for passing off. thus, to satisfy the second element in passing off, the material time at which confusion or likelihood of confusion must exist is the point of purchase.128 indeed, it would not make sense if starwood should fail in opposing the registration of staywell’s “park regis” marks because initial interest confusion does not suffice for trade mark purposes, but could then successfully sue staywell in passing off for using those registered marks.129  in england too, the doctrine of initial interest confusion does not apply in a passing off claim: see moroccanoil israel ltd v aldi stores ltd [2015] ecc 6 (at [25]).130 the plaintiffs contend that initial interest confusion can suffice in the passing off context.

 they rely on a commentary in christopher wadlow, the law of passing off: unfair competition by misrepresentation (sweet & maxwell, 5th ed, 2016) (“the law of passing off”) at para 5-181 on knight v beyond properties pty ltd and others [2007] ewhc 1251 (ch) (“knight v beyond properties”), which suggests that - in the context of a television programme – if initial confusion would cause damage to the claimant’s goodwill, that should be sufficient. however, in knight v beyond properties, the court drew a distinction between the viewing of a television programme and cases concerning the sale of goods in a shop; and accepted that in the latter, confusion must persist until the point of sale, which is the “critical time” before damage may result (at [81]). indeed, that provides the relevant comparison in our case, which concerns restaurants with food products that are bought, not television programmes that are viewed. furthermore, in the law of passing off, professor christopher wadlow (“prof wadlow”) commented that knight v beyond properties should not be taken as standing for the proposition that initial interest confusion is sufficient for establishing passing off (at para 5-182). i proceed on the basis that even for their passing off claim, the plaintiffs must establish confusion at point of purchase, not initial interest confusion.131 in the present case, the defendants did not use the name “luke’s lobster” for their lobster shacks because they wanted to capitalise on the goodwill of luke’s oyster bar & chop house. to the contrary, the name “luke’s lobster” was in use some two years before the first luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurant was opened (see [8] above); and all of the second defendant’s lobster shacks (ie, including those outside of singapore) are called “luke’s lobster”. the fact that the name was chosen bona fide makes a finding of deception less likely (amc ([105] above) at [105]; han’s ([3] above) at [201]).132 there are also many significant differences in style, price, range and type of food and services, between the two sides. for example, in han’s, the court noted the stark difference in the market segments targeted by the parties, respectively. the han’s restaurants were known for being “value for money”, and “affordable and good”, with the most expensive item on its menu being the $16.80 nz prime sirloin steak with black pepper sauce (at [203]). the han cuisine of naniwa restaurant on the other hand served omakase- and kaiseki-style sets, the japanese equivalents of western fine dining; and it had a substantial wine and alcohol menu (at [203]).133 the same comparisons may be made in the present case, save that the plaintiffs’ restaurants are the fine dining ones, and the defendants’ luke lobster shacks the simpler and relatively cheaper ones.134 the plaintiffs describe their luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants as fine dining restaurants with an “elegant yet personable and comfortable” dining atmosphere.

 however, the plaintiffs adduce no evidence of direct loss of sales. they do not, for instance, provide sales figures before and after luke’s lobster opened in singapore, to show that that they had lost customers to the defendants. instead, they simply rely on the survey to say it showed that confusion was likely; and so it was likely that they had lost, and would lose, business to the defendants. as i have stated above (at [84]-[87] above), i do not consider the plaintiffs’ survey evidence reliable. what is more, none of the 266 participants interviewed for the survey said that they had eaten at the defendants’ restaurants instead of the plaintiffs’ restaurants. even the two who provided comments about eating at the defendants’ restaurant (see [94]-[95] above) did not say that if they had not eaten there on those occasions, they would have gone to the plaintiffs’ restaurants instead.blurring/tarnishment160 citing novelty ([120] above) and cdl hotels international ltd v pontiac marina pte ltd [1998] 1 slr (r) 975, the plaintiffs contend that confusion would result in:(a) blurring, ie, loss of the plaintiffs’ business to the defendants; and(b) tarnishment, ie, the plaintiffs’ customers will think less well of the plaintiffs, because the defendants’ restaurant is not a fine dining establishment like the plaintiffs’ restaurants, but one with lower levels of service and standards.161 i have addressed the “blurring” argument in the previous section - the plaintiffs have not shown that they had lost and/or would lose business to the defendants’ restaurants  (see [159] above). as for tarnishment, the different dining experiences offered by the plaintiffs and defendants go against the plaintiffs at the misrepresentation/confusion stage of the analysis (see [132]-[146] above).162 the plaintiffs’ argument is that the value of their “brand and reputation as a restaurant offering fine dining services” may suffer if it is confused with the defendants’ restaurants, which offers a “fast-food type experience” [emphasis in original].

 there is some inconsistency between the plaintiffs’ arguments that, on the one hand, they wish to expand into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market; but on the other hand, they say their brand and reputation would be tarnished to be associated with a fast-food type experience like that.163 the evidence shows that the plaintiffs’ brand and reputation is indeed that of restaurants offering fine dining services (see [133]-[140] above). however, the plaintiffs did not think the name “luke’s” would suffer by being associated with a “lobster shack” when the plaintiffs sought to register the lobster shack by luke’s mark as a trade mark (see [151] above). i do not accept that if a customer of luke’s lobster perceived some association between the defendants’ and the plaintiffs’ restaurants, the plaintiffs’ reputation and brand would suffer thereby just because luke’s lobster does not offer a fine dining experience.restriction on expansion164 the plaintiffs cite novelty ([120] above) (at [117]), which in turn cited alfred dunhill limited v sunoptic sa [1979] fsr 337, where the english court of appeal prevented the defendant from marketing sunglasses under the name “dunhill” (which the plaintiff used to sell tobacco products). in that case, there was evidence that the plaintiff was planning to produce sunglasses.

165 the plaintiffs say that they have been restricted from expanding into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market. that is not so.166 there is nothing to stop the plaintiffs from expanding into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market. they are free to do so under the name of their restaurants, luke’s oyster bar & chop house. in that regard, they can use the registered luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark, the unregistered luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo, and perhaps even the lobster shack mark which they used for the lobster shack event during the period in between april-june 2020 when dining-in was not allowed. however, from the evidence, including the fact that the lobster shack event only lasted two weekends in june 2020 (see [147] above), it does not however appear that the plaintiffs seriously intend to expand into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market - in this vein, as i noted earlier, the plaintiffs’ failed attempt to register the lobster shack by luke’s mark does not show its genuine intention to expand into that market (see [154] above). loss of exclusivity in the trade name “luke’s”167 as i have decided in relation to the trade mark infringement claim, the plaintiffs’ trade name is “luke’s oyster bar & chop house” rather than “luke’s”, and in any event they have no monopoly or exclusivity over “luke’s” as a trade name (see [43], [46] and [49] above).confusion per se as damage168 the plaintiffs argue that confusion in terms of its customers perceiving an economic association between themselves and the defendants is damage, exacerbated by both sides running restaurants and thus being competitors.

169 i do not accept that confusion per se is equivalent to damage. if damage were presumed once misrepresentation and confusion were proved, that would make it meaningless to regard damage as an element of a passing off claim. i have already stated that in a passing off claim, as in a trade mark infringement claim, initial interest confusion is not sufficient if confusion is not established at the point of purchase (see [72] and [130] above).170 in novelty ([120] above), the court of appeal (at [123]) considered taylor bros ltd v taylors group ltd [1988] 2 nzlr 1. in that case, the wellington court of appeal thought that damage had been caused to the plaintiff (which ran a dry-cleaning business under the style “taylors”, “taylors drycleaners” and “taylors drycleaning”) by the defendant (which likewise operated a dry-cleaning business in wellington) trading under the name “taylors”, because “taylors” was distinctive of the plaintiff in the field of businesses associated with textile cleaning in the region and there will be a “natural tendency to treat the parties as associated”. however, the court of appeal in novelty commented (at [124]): it is hard to see how this constitutes damage as opposed to mere proof that there has been a misrepresentation by the defendant which has led to confusion between the business, goods or services of the plaintiff and those of the defendant.171 in the law of passing off ([130] above), prof wadlow suggests that (at para 4-41): the better way of putting the question is to ask whether confusion as such is so inherently likely to cause damage to the claimant, that further proof of damage will not be required. this must depend on the facts of each case …172 in other words, confusion per se is not damage, but if confusion in a particular case is inherently likely to cause damage, the plaintiff would then not need to go further in proving damage. in the present case, i am not satisfied as to confusion in the first place, and even if there were initial interest confusion, that would not persist to point of purchase and is not inherently likely to cause damage.173 in view of the above, i dismiss the plaintiffs’ passing off claim.defences174 in the circumstances, strictly speaking i do not need to decide on the defences raised to the passing off claim, viz, the defence of prior or concurrent user, and the “own name” defence. i will only make the following brief remarks.the defence of prior or concurrent user175 i accept that the plaintiffs would have established goodwill in “luke’s oyster bar & chop house” by 2013, some two years after the first of the plaintiffs’ restaurants was opened in 2011, by which time it had achieved revenues of about $4.7m and won an international accolade for the gemmill lane restaurant.

 luke’s lobster, on the other hand, only opened in singapore in september 2020, with pre-launch publicity earlier that year.176 in staywell (ca) ([23] above), the court of appeal accepted that goodwill can be generated by pre-trading or pre-business activities (at [140]) which, although need not be revenue-generating, should unequivocally evince the intention of the party to enter into the singapore market (at [142]). in relation to luke’s lobster in the present case, that would not have been until 2020. luke’s lobster did have a reputation amongst singaporeans even earlier than that, but that alone would not amount to luke’s lobster having goodwill in singapore prior to 2020. the defendants argue that the substantial reputation of luke’s lobster suffices to negate the reputation of the plaintiffs

 but the evidence does not support such an extreme position. instead, the plaintiffs had their own reputation (and goodwill) in luke’s oyster bar & chop house, and luke’s lobster had its own reputation. as such, i would not have been inclined to accept the defence of prior or concurrent user.the “own name” defence177 the defendants advance the “own name” defence despite amc ([105] above) where the court of appeal expressed the obiter view that the “own name” defence is not a defence to a claim in passing off (at [103]) (see also taco company of australia inc and another v taco bell pty ltd and others (1982) 42 alr 177).178 i would not add to the observations in amc. the point can be decided on another occasion.are the luke’s lobster trade marks invalid?179 the plaintiffs seek a declaration that the luke’s lobster trade marks are invalid pursuant to s 23 of the tma as they were registered in breach of ss 8(2)(b) and/or 8(7) of the tma.

184 if that were the case, then it would follow from my dismissal of the plaintiffs’ trade mark infringement claim (see [119] above), that the plaintiffs’ claim for invalidity of the luke’s lobster trade marks would also fail.185 however, the defendants point out that in staywell (ca) ([23] above), the court of appeal had - while noting that the text of the relevant sections of the tma was essentially the same - recognised a distinction between opposition and infringement proceedings in the analysis of likelihood of confusion (at [55]-[56]).

  it was very fair of the defendants to point this out, for the distinction could work to their disadvantage.186 the court of appeal explained the distinction as follows (staywell (ca) at [56], [60] and [61]):56 … on reflection we are satisfied there is a difference between the approach to the confusion inquiry in opposition and infringement proceedings, although there are considerable overlaps as well. if it seems surprising that different outcomes may ensue from the interpretation of essentially the same text, it is because of the context in which each provision is to be applied.…60 … in opposition proceedings the inquiry must take into account the full range of the competing monopoly rights that are already enjoyed on the one hand, namely the actual and notional fair uses to which the incumbent proprietor has or might fairly put his registered trade mark, and compare this against the full range of such rights sought by the applicant by reference to any actual use by the applicant (assuming there has been prior use) as well as notional fair uses to which the applicant may put his mark should registration be granted. this is the setting in which the question of whether there is likelihood of confusion is assessed …61 in infringement proceedings on the other hand, there is no question of the alleged infringer seeking to establish any monopoly rights. the only question is whether the actual use of a similar or identical sign by the infringer encroaches on the registered proprietor’s monopoly rights under s 26 of [the tma], to use the mark in relation to goods and services for which he is already using it as well as the penumbra of fair uses for which he might want to use it. there is therefore no need to examine any notional fair use by the alleged infringer because he is not seeking to acquire or assert any rights in respect of such penumbral uses.187 what i decided on marks-similarity and goods/services-similarly in the context of trade mark infringement applies equally to the invalidity claim. as for the confusion analysis, broadening that to include notional fair uses to which the luke’s lobster trade marks may be put, does not lead to any difference in the outcome. i find that the marks are not confusingly similar, whether in relation to the actual or notional fair uses of the luke’s lobster trade marks.whether the luke’s lobster trade marks offend against s 8(7)188 in view of my decision to dismiss the plaintiffs’ passing off claim (see [173] above), it follows that the luke’s lobster trade marks do not offend against s 8(7) of the tma. the use of the luke’s lobster trade marks is not liable to be prevented by the law of passing off.189 i thus dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim that the luke’s lobster trade marks are invalid.190 harking back to the trade mark infringement claim, my decision against the plaintiffs on their invalidity claim also means that the defendants have the benefit of the “registered mark” defence under s 28(3) of the tma (see [116]-[117] above).the plaintiffs’ survey evidence191 these are my comments on the plaintiffs’ survey evidence (see [84] above), which they had put forward to support a finding of confusion for both its trade mark and passing off claims.192 first and foremost, the survey used the luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo (which is not a registered trade mark) rather than the registered luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark. this was ironic when the plaintiffs were claiming for infringement of a registered trade mark. it was also unhelpful for the court to have to extrapolate, from the survey which used the plaintiffs’ unregistered logo, how the interviewees might have responded had the plaintiffs’ registered trade mark instead been used for the survey.193 the plaintiffs suggest that there is no real difference between their registered trade mark and unregistered logo,

 but i do not agree.the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark the luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo 194 most notably, the luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo omits the words “restaurant group”. whilst “travis masiero” is retained, the logo does not expressly refer to the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants being part of the travis masiero restaurant group. while there is still a stated association with mr masiero, interviewees might well be unaware of the travis masiero restaurant group. if the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark had been used instead, the interviewees would have seen “travis masiero restaurant group” in the registered trade mark itself. i cannot conclude that the results of the survey would have been the same had the registered trade mark been used instead of the unregistered logo.195 in han’s ([3] above), one deficiency of the survey was that its questions did not include an apostrophe in the spelling of “han’s”; the respondents were simply asked whether “h-a-n-s” sounded similar to “h-a-n” (at [166]). another deficiency was that the survey was conducted over the telephone and so the han’s marks and the han sign (see [34(c)] above) were not shown to the respondents (at [165]). a third deficiency was that there was no reference to the phrase “cuisine of naniwa” or the kushikatsu device in the han sign (at [167]). 196 the phrase “travis masiero restaurant group” is a significant part of the luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark (see [46] and [60] above) that was not shown as part of the survey. it was a deficiency for the survey not to use the plaintiffs’ registered trade mark (but instead the unregistered luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo) for comparison with the luke’s lobster trade marks.197 second, the interviewees did not represent the relevant cross-section of the public, contrary to the whitford guidelines (see [86] above). there were 266 participants interviewed for the survey. they were drawn from the plaintiffs’ mailing list of 18,000 persons. from that mailing list, names were randomly generated, emails were sent to invite their participation (12,000 of such emails were sent), and ultimately 266 participated in the survey.

 but the interviewees for the survey included no potential customers – all of them were actual customers. i cannot conclude that the plaintiffs’ potential customers would have responded in the same way as their actual customers; nor can i postulate how the results of the survey would have turned out, if potential customers had been included in the sample group.200 third, the survey evidence should directly ascertain the cause of any confusion, and this was not done. in sarika (hc) ([86] above), this was noted as a shortcoming of the surveys used in that case (at [136]). as the court explained, confusion for the purposes of s 27(2) of the tma must arise from marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity (at [136]). the survey evidence would be unhelpful if the interviewees had applied a different test in concluding that they were confused.201 in han’s ([3] above), the court found the survey question that was the most relevant to establishing actual confusion to be deficient as a result of how it was phrased – it was leading and would “lead the interviewee into a field of speculation upon which he would not otherwise have embarked” (at [169]–[171]). with that and the other deficiencies (discussed at [195] above), the court placed no weight on the survey findings in so far as they were said to show actual confusion or the likelihood of confusion (at [172]).202 here, the interviewees were not asked any question to ascertain the cause of any confusion.203 moreover, the questions in the survey were not limited to marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity. as i noted at the outset, the registered luke’s oyster bar & chop house trade mark was not even shown to the interviewees, instead it was the unregistered luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo that was shown to them. as all the interviewees were customers of the plaintiffs, in answering the questions, they would likely have drawn on their experience of having dined at the plaintiffs’ restaurants. however, some 36% of them - more than a third – had not heard of luke’s lobster in singapore,

 including two interviewees who had eaten there: see [155] above). since the interviewees were much more familiar with luke’s oyster bar & chop house than with luke’s lobster, the responses obtained may thus have taken into account extraneous considerations other than those relating to marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity, which the court of appeal in staywell (ca) ([23] above) had said should not feature in the confusion analysis in a trade mark claim. that would be exacerbated by some interviewees having never heard of luke’s lobster or been to the defendants’ restaurants before.204 fourth, i do not consider the survey to be fair; it was leading or otherwise problematic in various ways. this too was contrary to the whitford guidelines.205 one of the key objectives of the survey was to establish “whether luke’s [ie, the plaintiffs] customers routinely and commonly refer to ‘luke’s’ or by reference to any other trade names such as ‘luke’s oyster bar’ or ‘luke’s oyster bar & chop house’”.

 the defendants had already opened their first luke’s lobster shack in singapore – the one at isetan, shaw house, opened in september 2020 (see [8] above).210 the interviewees were first asked some introductory questions, including question 3 which showed four restaurant logos including the unregistered luke’s oyster bar & chop house logo (but not those of luke’s lobster’s yet).

212 by its nature, question 6 would tend to elicit responses with more casual references to the plaintiffs’ restaurants, as compared to, eg, “what is the name of this restaurant?” while one objective of the survey was to find out if the plaintiffs’ customers referred to the plaintiffs’ restaurants as “luke’s”, other objectives were to establish “the reaction of customers to [the luke’s lobster trade marks] (i.e. whether they perceive a link between these marks and [the plaintiffs])”, and “whether or not consumers perceive an association between luke’s lobster and [the plaintiffs] and if so, the likely nature of this relationship”,

 ie, to obtain evidence for the plaintiffs’ claims. by eliciting from the interviewees responses which were either just “luke’s” or would start with “luke’s”, as a precursor to showing them the luke’s lobster trade marks (which also included the word “luke’s”), question 6 would tend to shape the interviewees’ thinking.213 that shaping process continued through questions 7 and 8.214 question 7 sought to understand what types of foods were most strongly associated with the plaintiffs’ restaurants. the restaurant name which the participant identified with the luke’s lobster & chop house logo and mentioned in response to question 6, was used for questions 7 and 8a, ie, if a participant had said “luke’s” to question 6, the interviewer would then refer to the plaintiffs’ restaurants as “luke’s” for the purposes of questions 7 and 8a.

216 question 7 would have been fairer as an open-ended question. if that had been done, instead of offering “seafood” as one of four choices, less than 90% might have responded, “seafood”. for instance, an interviewee who might have said “oysters” to an open-ended question, could have ended up picking “seafood” because that was one of four choices offered. a “seafood” response to question 7 would then open the door to question 8a about the types of seafood associated with the plaintiffs’ restaurants, including lobsters.

219 question 9 about the luke’s lobster trade marks came only after questions about how interviewees referred to the plaintiffs’ restaurants (question 6); the types of foods served there, including “seafood” as a choice (question 7); the types of seafood, including “lobster” as a choice (question 8a); and the dining experience at the plaintiffs’ restaurants (question 8b).220 question 9 involved showing interviewees the luke’s lobster trade marks, and asking them what was the first thing that came to their minds.

 the responses were then grouped into categories: awareness related; perceived connection or disconnection between luke’s lobster and the plaintiffs’ restaurants; experience with luke’s lobster; and opinions on the luke’s lobster trade marks.

i’m going to show you some statements. please tell me which one, if any, you feel best described your view on luke’s lobster and luke’s [ie, the plaintiffs] when you first saw this logo or heard about luke’s lobster opening in singapore. if you don’t know or are unsure about which statement to choose, that is an answer too.[emphasis in original]223  the four statements were:

‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are part of the same group or business organisation.‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are connected or affiliated in some way.‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are not part of the same group or business organisation.i don’t know / not sure [sic] [if they are related or not].224 it is unfortunate that question 12a referred to the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants as “luke’s”. even if an interviewee had not said “luke’s” in response to question 6 when asked how he would refer to the plaintiffs’ restaurants in a conversation or text message (see [211] above), here he was being told, the plaintiffs’ restaurants are referred to as “luke’s”, and then asked about the perceived association between “luke’s lobster” and “luke’s”. that was not a fair question, it would lead the interviewees to think of the plaintiffs’ restaurants as “luke’s”, even if they had not initially thought of them as such.225 the phrasing of the four statements (set out in [223]) is also problematic. the statement “‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are part of the same group or business organisation” has a negative counterpart, ie, “‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are not part of the same group or business organisation”. but there is no negative counterpart to “‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are connected or affiliated in some way” - the statement “‘luke’s lobster’ and ‘luke’s’ are not connected or affiliated in some way” was not one of the choices offered. interviewees were thus presented with two positive choices, and only one negative choice (the opposite of one of the positive choices). that could have skewed the results. it is much like asking interviewees whether they think “luke’s lobster” and “luke’s” are part of the same group or business organisation; and then asking those who say, “no”, whether they are nevertheless connected or affiliated in some way.226 that is essentially what was done in sarika (hc) ([86] above) where the survey respondents who thought it was unlikely that the manufacturer of “nutella” produced “nutello” were then asked whether it was likely that the manufacturer of “nutella” had authorised the use of the name “nutello” (at [120]). as the court commented, that may have planted in the minds of the survey respondents the possibility of a licensing arrangement between the manufacturer of nutella and the defendants when they would not, of their own accord, have considered such a possibility (at [121]). in han’s ([3] above), where one of the survey questions had asked respondents if they thought “h-a-n-s” (referring to the plaintiff) and “h-a-n” (referring to the defendant) belonged to the same management (at [164]), the court similarly considered that question to be problematic for it bluntly introduced the possibility to the survey respondents that the plaintiff and defendant might be under the same management, when that might not have reasonably occurred to them in the first place (at [171]).227 it would have been simpler and safer just to ask interviewees whether luke’s lobster and the luke’s oyster bar & chop house restaurants were associated or not.228 as it was, the responses to question 12a were as follows:

now please tell me which one, if any, you feel best described your view on luke’s lobster and luke’s after you saw the new luke’s lobster restaurant in isetan or found out more information on it. if you don’t know or are unsure about which statement to choose, that is an answer too.231 interviewees were asked to pick between the same four statements as for question 12a (see [223] above), with the same problems i have discussed above (see [224]–[226]).232 the responses to question 12b were as follows:

 curiously, after having supposedly ‘seen’ or ‘found out’ more information about the luke’s lobster restaurant in singapore, the proportion of them who perceived some association between luke’s lobster and the plaintiffs’ restaurants dropped from 72% to 59%, and the proportion who said they were not part of the same group or business organisation rose from 6% to 13% (see [228(c)] and [232(c)] above).234 turning to those who were aware of the luke’s lobster restaurant in singapore: after seeing that luke’s lobster restaurant or finding out more information on it, the proportion of them who perceived some association between luke’s lobster and the plaintiffs’ restaurants fell from 54% to 25%, and the proportion who said they were not part of the same group or business organisation rose from 32% to 64% (see [228(b)] and [232(b)] above).235 the survey thus suggests that the more that a customer of the plaintiffs knows about luke’s lobster, the less likely he is to think it is associated with the plaintiffs’ restaurants.236 as i noted above (at [200]–[203]), no questions were posed in the survey to ascertain the cause of any perceived association between luke’s lobster and the plaintiffs’ restaurants. in sarika (hc) ([86] above), neither party’s survey there had ascertained the cause of confusion (at [136]). the court suggested that “why” questions could have been asked of those who perceived some association between the two sides (at [139]-[140]). that was also not done in the present case.237 instead, any interviewee who had not mentioned “lobster” in response to question 8a (see [217] above) would be asked question 13: “… does luke’s oyster bar & chop house in the heeren and/or gemmil [sic] lane serve lobster dishes or are you not sure?”

 as the report of the survey states, 186 had mentioned “lobster” in response to question 8a, and another 55 “who didn’t associate lobster with luke’s initially did so when prompted in [question 13].”

 questions 7, 8a and 13 only test whether interviewees associate lobster dishes with the plaintiffs’ restaurants, or are aware that they serve lobster dishes. the responses do not mean that the plaintiffs’ restaurants had a reputation for, or goodwill in, lobster dishes.

 to illustrate the point bluntly, a person who did not like the lobster dishes at the plaintiffs’ restaurants could still say that he associated the plaintiffs’ restaurants with lobster (as a type of seafood) in response to question 8a, or at least that he was aware that the plaintiffs’ restaurants did serve lobster dishes in response to question 13.238 fifth, there was late disclosure of the whole of the survey. the whitford guidelines (see [86] above) require that the totality of the answers given be disclosed and made available to the defendants (sarika (hc) at [134]; han’s ([3] above) at [31]). the 266 original questionnaires were, however, only provided on friday, 5 march 2021, shortly before the trial commenced on tuesday, 9 march 2021. mr coops acknowledged that at least a month would be needed to review all the questionnaires.

 the defendants could not have done so and proceeded with the trial as scheduled. 239 in the event, the defendants proceeded with the cross-examination of mr coops without reference to the original questionnaires. at the close of the evidence, counsel on both sides agreed that neither side would refer to the original questionnaires in their submissions.
