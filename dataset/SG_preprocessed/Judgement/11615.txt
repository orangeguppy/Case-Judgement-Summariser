        chan sek keong cj (delivering the judgment of the

                court):
introduction
1       the appellants (“the appellants”)

                    are a group of 21 investors in derivative credit-linked notes called “dbs

                    high notes 5” (“the hn5”) which were issued by the

                    respondent, dbs bank ltd (“the respondent”). in originating

                    summons no 774 of 2009 (“the os”), they brought proceedings

                    against the respondent, on behalf of themselves as well as 192 other plaintiffs

                    listed in the schedule to the os (“the 192 other plaintiffs”), for

                    the refund of the entire capital sum which they and the 192 other plaintiffs had

                    lost in investing in the hn5 (less the amount of interest received thereon)

                    consequent upon the bankruptcy on 15 september 2008 of lehman brothers

                    holdings inc (“lehman”), one of the reference entities to which

                    the hn5 were linked. the high court judge (“the judge”) dismissed

                    the appellants’ action (see soon kok tiang and others v

                        dbs bank ltd and another matter [2011] 2 slr 716

                    (“the hc judgment”)). the appellants then brought the present

                    appeal. we should mention, as a preliminary point, that prior to the hearing of

                    this appeal, two of the 192 other plaintiffs withdrew from the appeal. the

                    appellants accordingly applied to this court (via summons no 2274 of 2011)

                    for leave to amend the os by deleting the names of those two plaintiffs from the

                    schedule to the os. we allowed the application (which the respondent consented

                    to) with costs to the respondent fixed at $300.
background
the launch of the hn5
2       the material facts as pleaded by the parties are

                    not in dispute. the respondent launched the sale of the hn5 on 30 march

                    2007 in two tranches, one in singapore dollars (“the sgd tranche”)

                    and one in us dollars (“the usd tranche”). the respondent’s

                    offer of the hn5 was expressed to be made on the basis of the information

                    contained in a 93-page pricing statement dated 29 march 2007 (“the

                    pricing statement”) and a 168-page base prospectus dated 22 december

                    2005 as amended by a supplementary base prospectus dated 5 april 2006

                    (collectively referred to hereafter as “the base prospectus”).

                    these documents set out in great detail, inter

                        alia: (a) the terms and conditions applicable to the hn5;

                    (b) the manner in which the respondent and its related entity,

                    constellation investments ltd (“constellation”), would use the

                    funds of purchasers of the hn5 (“hn5 holders”); and (c) the

                    risks involved in investing in the hn5.
3       the sale of the hn5 was effected by the

                    respondent accepting applications made by prospective hn5 holders on prescribed

                    application forms (“application forms”). each application form

                    contained an acknowledgement by the prospective hn5 holder that he:
(a)     “agreed [to] the terms and

                        conditions on the reverse of this form and the terms and conditions set out

                        in … [the] pricing statement”;[note: 1] and
(b)     “ha[d] assessed [the]

                        suitability of the product against [his] risk attitude, financial means, and

                        investment objectives”.[note: 2]
at the time the

                    hn5 were marketed, it was not possible to assess the probability of default by

                    any of the reference entities to which the hn5 were linked, except on the basis

                    (since discredited) of the credit ratings given to them by the credit rating

                    agencies relied on by the respondent, viz,

                    standard & poor’s, moody’s and fitch.
the nature and structure of the hn5
4       the pricing statement described the hn5 as

                    “structured notes”[note: 3] and warned

                    prospective hn5 holders that “if a credit event [as defined at [8] below] … occur[red] before the maturity

                    date [viz, 16 november 2012], [they might]

                    lose their entire investment and [might] not receive any principal amount on the

                        [hn5]”[note: 4] [emphasis in original

                    omitted]. the circumstances in which and the reasons why this might happen were

                    not clarified or explained. prospective hn5 holders were also warned that the

                    purchase of the hn5 involved certain risks, and that they should:[note: 5]
… ensure that they understand the nature of the [hn5] and should

                        carefully study the matters set out in the base prospectus (and in

                        particular, the section on “risk factors” in the base

                        prospectus) and the contents of [the] pricing statement (and in particular,

                        the section on “risk factors” in [the] pricing statement)

                        before they invest in the [hn5]. [emphasis in original omitted]
5       the pricing statement described the hn5 as

                    “5.5-year structured credit notes designed for investors seeking enhanced

                    yield by providing exposure to a first-to-default basket of geographically

                    diversified investment grade credits”.[note: 6] the credit basket

                    (“the hn5 credit basket”) consisted of seven banks and one

                    sovereign entity as follows:
(a)malayan banking berhad;
(b)bank of china limited;
(c)macquarie bank limited;
(d)merrill lynch & co, inc;
(e)morgan stanley;
(f)the goldman sachs group, inc;
(g)lehman; and
(h)malaysia.
these eight reference entities (collectively, “the reference

                    entities”) were stated to have been selected with the following

                        objectives:[note: 7]
(i)    reducing the likelihood of a credit event by

                            choosing only investment grade credits;
(ii)  reducing mark-to-market risk by selecting highly

                            rated [r]eference [e]ntities, as investment grade rated credits

                            typically tend to be more stable, compared to sub-investment grade

                            credits;
(iii)  enhancing the basket yield by selecting higher

                            yielding reference obligations (by choosing less senior debts,

                            especially for banks/investment banks) of these highly rated [r]eference

                            [e]ntities; and
(iv)  reducing liquidity risk by selecting [r]eference

                            [e]ntities whose debt securities are among the more commonly traded in

                            the credit market as opposed to choosing higher rated [r]eference

                            [e]ntities whose debt securities are less liquid and do not trade

                            commonly thereby resulting in wider bid/offer spreads.
6       the hn5 were structured such that the respondent

                    would use the funds raised from the sale of the hn5 to purchase two structured

                    notes issued by constellation, a special purpose cayman islands trust company

                    established by the respondent in 2003. these two structured notes (collectively,

                    “the reference notes”) were:
(a)     structured retail notes

                        series 75 (“srn series 75”) vis-à-vis the sgd tranche of the hn5; and
(b)     structured retail notes series 76

                        (“srn series 76”) vis-à-vis

                        the usd tranche.
the pricing statement explained

                    constellation’s role and the function of the reference notes as

                        follows:[note: 8]
constellation is a special purpose trust company established by [the

                        respondent] in 2003. it is owned by a charitable trust and incorporated

                        under the laws of the cayman islands. its primary objective is the issuing

                        of various credit-linked and other structured notes to both retail and

                        institutional investors.
constellation uses the funds raised in issuing notes to invest in high

                        quality bonds or structured securities with a rating of aa or better (as

                        rated by standard & poor’s, moody’s or fitch) to secure its

                        obligations under its notes and enters into derivative contracts with [the

                        respondent] in order to generate the relatively high yields under its notes.

                        constellation has issued 70 different structured notes to investors in hong

                        kong over the past 4 years under its us$5,000,000,000 limited recourse

                        structured note programme (the constellation programme). to date, no credit

                        event has occurred in respect of any of its issuances and all interest

                        payments under its notes have been paid in full to investors.
the proceeds of the [hn5] will be used to purchase … the reference

                        notes … to be issued by constellation under the constellation

                        programme. the performance of the [hn5] is directly linked to the reference

                        notes. therefore, in addition to the reference entities [as defined at

                            [5] above], the [hn5 holder] is

                        exposed to the credit risk of constellation in relation to the reference

                        notes, in particular, to the high quality bonds or structured securities

                        purchased by constellation to secure its obligations under the reference

                        notes.
[emphasis in original omitted]
7       it should be noted that although the pricing

                    statement stated that constellation would use the funds raised from the issue of

                    the reference notes (“the reference notes funds”) to invest in

                    “high quality bonds or structured securities with a rating of aa or

                    better (as rated by standard & poor’s, moody’s or

                        fitch)”[note: 9] to secure its obligations

                    under the reference notes, it did not say that those funds would be used to

                    purchase, specifically, what we will hereafter term “the reference

                    obligations” (ie, the bonds or structured

                    securities issued by the reference entities as set out in appendix d of the

                    pricing statement), all of which were rated lower than “aa” (or

                    the equivalent). the pricing statement also did not explain what bearing

                    constellation’s investments would have on the risks undertaken by hn5

                    holders. to date, the appellants have no knowledge of the identity of the actual

                    high-quality bonds and/or structured securities purchased by constellation to

                    secure its obligations under the reference notes.
8       the pricing statement stated that hn5 holders

                    would receive:
(a)     quarterly interest of 5% per annum

                        and 6.5% per annum for, respectively, the sgd tranche and the usd tranche of

                        the hn5 until 16 november 2012, which was the scheduled maturity date

                        of the hn5 (“the maturity date”); and
(b)     on the maturity date, 100% of the

                        principal amount invested.
the pricing statement stated

                    that the aforesaid payments would be made unless,

                        inter alia, a “credit event”

                    –

                    ie, an event of default in respect of any of the

                    reference entities – occurred prior to the maturity date. if a credit

                    event occurred, the reference notes (which were stated to be linked to the

                    performance of the reference entities) would terminate, and would also cause the

                    hn5 to terminate. hn5 holders would then receive an amount equivalent to what

                    the respondent would receive as the “credit event redemption

                    amount” (“cera”) under the reference notes. this was

                    explained in the pricing statement as follows:[note: 10]
if a credit event (e.g. a default on existing debt) in relation to a

                        [r]eference [e]ntity occurs under the reference notes, the reference notes

                        will terminate. consequentially, the [hn5] will also terminate and investors

                        in the [hn5] will receive a sgd amount (in relation to the sgd tranche

                        notes) or usd amount (in relation to the usd tranche notes) equivalent to

                        what the [respondent] will receive as the [cera] under the reference

                        notes.
the pricing statement stated that the respondent, as the calculation

                    agent under both the reference notes and the hn5 (“the calculation

                    agent”), “ha[d] the sole discretion to determine whether a credit

                    event ha[d] occurred in relation to any [r]eference

                        [e]ntity”,[note: 11] and was “also

                    responsible for determining, amongst other things, any … calculations

                    … required under the terms and conditions of the

                        [hn5]”.[note: 12]
9       the pricing statement highlighted that the

                    termination of the hn5 upon the occurrence of a credit event was on a

                        “first-to-default”[note: 13] basis, ie:[note: 14]
[the hn5] are linked to the reference notes and, in turn, the credit of

                        the reference entities under the reference notes on a

                        “first-to-default” basis. this means that the credit event

                        that triggers the credit linked redemption of the reference notes is the

                        first default of any of the reference entities under the reference

                        notes.
10     as for what would constitute a credit event,

                    this was defined in appendix d of the pricing statement as

                        follows:[note: 15]
(a)    in the case of any [r]eference [e]ntity (other

                            than malaysia), each of bankruptcy, failure to pay and restructuring;

                            and
(b)    in the case of malaysia, each of failure to pay,

                            restructuring, repudiation/moratorium and obligation

                            acceleration.
in this regard, “failure to pay” was defined as the

                    failure of a reference entity to pay any amounts due under (inter alia) the reference obligation associated with it as

                    specified in appendix d of the pricing statement. in lehman’s case,

                    the relevant reference obligation consisted of us$1.25bn worth of 5.75%

                    subordinated notes due on 1 march 2017 (isin code:

                        us524908ub47)[note: 16] (“the lehman

                    note”).
features of the hn5
11     the hn5 were credit-linked notes and not

                    asset-linked notes, and were a novel financial product in singapore’s

                    financial market at the time they were launched. from the foregoing survey of

                    their nature and structure, the following features can be seen.
12     first, the hn5 had some features of an

                    ordinary bond, but they were not bonds as hn5 holders, apart from being exposed

                    to the credit risk of the reference entities, were also exposed to the credit

                    risk of constellation and that of the issuer(s) of the high-quality bonds and/or

                    structured securities purchased by constellation to secure its obligations under

                    the reference notes. as stated in the pricing statement:[note: 17]
the performance of the [hn5] is directly linked to the reference notes.

                        therefore, in addition to the reference entities, the [hn5 holder] is

                        exposed to the credit risk of constellation in relation to the reference

                        notes, in particular, to the high quality bonds or structured securities

                        purchased by constellation to secure its obligations under the reference

                        notes.
in addition, hn5 holders were exposed to the credit risk of the

                    respondent, foreign exchange rate risks, liquidity risks and general market

                    fluctuations. vis-à-vis, specifically, the risk of

                    default by one or more of the reference entities (ie, the risk of a credit event occurring), it would appear, at

                    the time the hn5 were launched, that this risk was not likely to materialise,

                    having regard to the high credit ratings given to the reference entities (we

                    note in particular that at that time, lehman had a credit rating of

                    “a+” from standard & poor’s and fitch, and a credit

                    rating of “a1” from moody’s).[note: 18] the pricing

                    statement also stated:[note: 19]
constellation has issued 70 different structured notes … over the

                        past 4 years [ie, since 2003] under its

                        us$5,000,000,000 limited recourse structured note programme … to

                        date, no credit event has occurred in respect of any of its issuances and

                        all interest payments under its notes have been paid in full to

                        investors.
again, this would give the impression that it was unlikely that a

                    credit event would occur vis-à-vis the reference

                    notes, to which the performance of the hn5 was directly linked. the pricing

                    statement nonetheless warned prospective hn5 holders that the credit ratings

                    assigned by credit rating agencies might not fully reflect the true risks of

                    investing in the hn5. in comparison, the respondent assumed no risk in the event

                    of a credit event occurring (and, consequently, the hn5 terminating before the

                    maturity date) as the pricing statement expressly stated (at pp 2, 4 and

                        14)[note: 20] that the respondent’s

                    liability under the hn5 in that event was only to pay to hn5 holders what it

                    would receive from constellation as the cera under the reference

                notes.
13     second, the components for calculating the

                    cera were such that if a credit event occurred, there was a high likelihood that

                    hn5 holders would receive a zero payout under the hn5 because there was an

                    equally high likelihood that the respondent would receive a zero payout from

                    constellation under the reference notes. in fact, as it turned out, the

                    computation of the cera to be paid upon lehman’s bankruptcy (the credit

                    event in the present case) actually yielded a negative figure. in practical

                    terms, this translated into a zero payout for hn5 holders since their losses

                    were limited to the principal amount which they had invested in the hn5. thus,

                    stripped to their bare essentials, the hn5 were in substance a bet or wager (in

                    legal jargon) that no credit event would occur during the 5.5-year tenure of

                    these notes: if hn5 holders “won” this bet, they could potentially

                    receive at the end of the 5.5-year period an aggregate return of 27.5% and

                    35.75% on, respectively, the sgd tranche and the usd tranche. in reality, the

                    hn5 were a bet dressed up and marketed as an

                “investment”.
14     third, the explanation given at p 1 of

                    the pricing statement for selecting eight reference entities (viz, the reference entities) to make up the hn5 credit basket

                    – namely, to (inter alia) “reduc[e]

                    the likelihood of a credit event”[note: 21] (see [5] above) – could give an unwary hn5 holder

                    a false sense of security that the risk of a credit event occurring was low. it

                    was only at p 9 of the pricing statement that the aforesaid explanation was

                    qualified by the statement that “all else being equal, the greater the

                    number of [r]eference [e]ntities in the [hn5] credit basket, the riskier the

                    [hn5] are”.[note: 22] in this connection, we note that

                    before both the judge and this court, the appellants did indeed labour under the

                    misapprehension that having eight reference entities in the hn5 credit basket

                    would provide diversification benefits. this was evidenced by their argument

                    that they should not have lost their entire investment in the hn5 as lehman was

                    only one of eight reference entities.
the collapse of lehman
15     as mentioned at [2] above, the hn5 were launched on 30 march 2007.

                    altogether, the respondent accepted 1,127 applications for the hn5, totalling

                    s$91.915m for the sgd tranche and us$7.93m for the usd tranche. the hn5 were

                    issued on 16 may 2007. between 16 august 2007 and 18 august 2008,

                    the appellants received five payments of quarterly interest, amounting to

                    s$128,303.27 for the sgd tranche and us$22,741.07 for the usd

                tranche.
16     unfortunately for hn5 holders, on

                    15 september 2008, lehman became the first reference entity in the hn5

                    credit basket to default (“the defaulted reference entity”) when

                    it filed a voluntary petition under ch 11 of the us bankruptcy code

                    (title 11, usc). by a credit event notice dated 17 september 2008, the

                    respondent informed hn5 holders of the occurrence of this credit event and the

                    termination of the hn5. subsequently, by a letter dated 28 october 2008,

                    the respondent informed hn5 holders that the cera under the reference notes was

                    zero and, thus, the cera under the hn5 would likewise be zero. the letter was

                    accompanied by an appendix explaining how the cera under the reference notes was

                    calculated.
17     the respondent also issued a public statement

                    on 27 october 2008 setting out a list of questions and answers in relation

                    to the credit event triggered by lehman’s bankruptcy (“the

                    faqs”) (see

                    <http://www.dbs.com/dbsgroup/announcements/pages/20081028hn5_final_valuation_issuer_faq.pdf>

                    (accessed 31 october 2011)). it is pertinent to note the answer to the

                    question as to why the cera under the reference notes (and, in turn, the cera

                    under the hn5) was zero:
2.    what was the major contributing factor to the

                            substantial reduction or the reduction to zero of the

                        [cera]?
the major factor that contributed to the substantial reduction or the

                        reduction to zero of the [cera] was the substantial notional loss on the [r]eference [o]bligation of lehman

                            [ie, the lehman note] … resulting

                        from the substantial drop in the price of such [r]eference [o]bligation. the

                        bankruptcy of lehman … has caused the [lehman note] to trade at

                        values close to zero.
[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]
18     it should be mentioned that although the faqs

                    stated that the cera was zero because of the “notional loss” on

                    the lehman note, the pricing statement did not expressly highlight that the link

                    between the cera and the defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation

                    was “notional”. this fact becomes clear only upon a close analysis

                    of the terms of the pricing statement. for the purposes of calculating the cera

                    to be paid upon the occurrence of a credit event, any loss sustained on the

                    defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation might only be a notional

                    loss as the pricing statement did not require constellation to use the reference

                    notes funds to purchase that particular reference obligation or, for that

                    matter, any of the reference obligations, and, thus, constellation would not

                    have suffered any loss if it had not invested the reference notes funds in the

                    defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation, whose value would have

                    fallen upon the defaulted reference entity’s default. in other words, the

                    hn5 were structured such that it was not necessary for constellation to have

                    suffered any actual loss on the defaulted

                    reference entity’s reference obligation before a credit event could occur.

                    all that was necessary was for one of the reference entities (by definition, the

                    defaulted reference entity) to (inter alia)

                    default in paying any amount due under the reference obligation associated with

                    it, which reference obligation might not even form part of constellation’s

                    actual investment portfolio. in this connection, we note that it is not known

                    whether constellation had in fact invested the reference notes funds in the

                    lehman note (the defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation in the

                    present case).
19     in the light of the terms and conditions of

                    the contract governing the hn5 (“the hn5 contract”), the

                    appellants had little or no legal basis to argue that they were entitled to

                    receive anything other than (as will be seen) a zero payment from the respondent

                    when the credit event triggered by lehman’s bankruptcy occurred. they

                    could not claim that they were not bound by the terms and conditions of the hn5

                    contract since (as mentioned at [3] above)

                    they had expressly agreed to those terms and conditions in the application forms

                    which they submitted to the respondent. they also could not rely on the usual

                    vitiating factors in contract law, such as fraud, mistake, misrepresentation,

                        non est factum, etc. in particular, the appellants could not claim that they did

                    not understand the true risks of investing in the hn5 as they had acknowledged

                    in their application forms that they “ha[d] assessed [the] suitability of

                    the product against [their] risk attitude[s], financial means, and investment

                        objectives”.[note: 23]
20     the appellants then discovered, probably to

                    their surprise, that the pricing statement contained four different descriptions

                    of the cera (“cera descriptions”), which they interpreted to be

                    inconsistent and irreconcilable with one another (and in the case of the fourth

                    description, manifestly inconsistent with the third). this interpretation, if

                    correct, would lead to different cera payouts under the hn5, depending on which

                    cera description was applied. armed with this discovery, the appellants

                    commenced the os against the respondent for, in the main: (a) a declaration

                    that the hn5 were void; and (b) a consequential order that the respondent

                    pay to each of them (as well as to each of the 192 other plaintiffs), inter alia, the principal amount invested in the hn5.

                    the appellants’ basis for seeking these reliefs was that:[note: 24]
… [t]he terms and conditions governing the [hn5] were uncertain

                        when it came to the calculation of the cera. the uncertainty arose because

                        the [pricing statement] contained 4 possible formulae for calculating the

                        cera which were different, inconsistent and irreconcilable.
21     as mentioned at [1] above, the judge dismissed the os. the appellants then

                    brought the present appeal.
the four cera descriptions
22     before we proceed to analyse the judge’s

                    reasons for dismissing the appellants’ claim, we will first set out the

                    four different cera descriptions in the pricing statement.
23     the first cera description, which appears at

                    p 2 of the pricing statement, reads as follows:[note: 25]
the [cera] under the reference notes will be based

                            on the prevailing market price of the [d]efaulted reference

                        entity’s reference obligation less charged asset adjustment amount and

                        less hedging costs. [emphasis added]
in this connection:
(a)     “charged asset adjustment

                        amount” is defined at p 14 of the pricing statement as

                        “the shortfall of the market value of the charged assets over the

                        principal amount of the charged assets”[note: 26] (the

                        “charged assets” being the high-quality bonds and/or

                        structured securities purchased by constellation to secure its obligations

                        under the reference notes (see [6]–[7] above));

                        and
(b)     “hedging costs” are defined at p 15 of the pricing

                        statement as “the losses, expenses and costs (if any) to

                        constellation in terminating, adjusting or re-establishing etc the

                        underlying or related hedging arrangements”.[note: 27]
24     the second cera description, which is at

                    p 4 of the pricing statement, provides as follows:[note: 28]
the [cera] is in summary the amount

                            equal to the nominal value of the

                        reference notes less the amount of loss suffered on the reference obligation

                        of the defaulted reference entity less any depreciation of the market value

                        of the collateral [ie, the charged assets] and

                        less costs and expenses associated with the termination of the hedging

                        arrangements in respect of the reference notes. [emphasis added]
25     the third cera description (at

                    pp 14–15 of the pricing statement) states:[note: 29]
the [cera] will be determined as follows:
(a)    in relation to the

                            sgd tranche notes
[(apa x fp) – caaa – hc] x prevailing exchange rate
(b)    in relation to the

                            usd tranche notes
(apa x fp) – caaa – hc
where:

apa means the aggregate principal

                        amount;

caaa means charged assets adjustment amount,

                        which in summary is the shortfall of the market value of the charged assets

                        over the principal amount of the charged assets;

fp means final price, which in summary is

                        the price of the reference obligation of the defaulted reference entity,

                        expressed as a percentage;

hc means hedging costs, which in summary are

                        the losses, expenses and costs (if any) to constellation in terminating,

                        adjusting or re-establishing etc the underlying or related hedging

                        arrangements; and

prevailing exchange rate means the exchange

                        rate of usd/sgd on the valuation date [defined at p 15 of the pricing

                        statement as a date falling within 80 business days from the “credit

                        event determination date”, which is the date on which a credit event

                        notice, delivered in accordance with the terms of the hn5 contract, is

                        effective], calculated as the rate of exchange of the number of sgd for

                        which one usd can be exchanged on the relevant date, as the calculation

                        agent [viz, the respondent] shall determine in

                        good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
please refer to the section on “selected definitions in relation to

                        the reference notes” in appendix d of [the] pricing statement

                        for the meanings of the above terms.
[emphasis in bold in original]
for ease of reference, we will hereafter, where appropriate, use the

                    same terms and abbreviations as those used in the above extract (ie, “aggregate principal

                    amount”/“apa”, “caaa”/“charged assets

                    adjustment amount”, etc) in discussing the

                    cera.
26     the fourth cera description is set out at

                    p 61 of the pricing statement in diagrammatic form.[note: 30]

                    we reproduce below the judge’s text-based transliteration of that

                    description (see sub-para (d) of [14] of the hc judgment):
[cera] means the pro rata amount per note

                            [ie, per hn5] of the amount in the

                        specified currency calculated in accordance with the following

                        formula:

for sgd tranche

                        notes

[[(apa) x (1 – fp)] – caaa – hc] x prevailing exchange

                        rate

for usd tranche

                        notes

[(apa) x (1 – fp)] – caaa – hc
for this purpose,
(a)    

              final price means

                            the price of the reference obligation of the defaulted reference entity

                            expressed as a percentage, determined in accordance with the valuation

                            method [defined at p 70 of the pricing statement[note: 31] as “the market value

                            determined by the calculation agent with respect to the valuation

                            date”.]
(b)    

              charged assets adjustment

                                amount means an amount which represents the shortfall of

                            the market value of the charged assets over the principal amount of the

                            charged assets; provided however, that where there is an excess of the

                            market value over the principal amount of the charged assets, such

                            amount shall be expressed as a negative number. the calculation agent

                            shall determine in good faith and in a reasonable manner the market

                            value of the charged assets.
(c)    

              prevailing exchange

                                rate means the exchange rate of usd/sgd on the valuation

                            date, calculated as the rate of exchange of the number of sgd for which

                            one usd can be exchanged on the valuation date, as the calculation agent

                            shall determine in good faith and in a commercially reasonable

                            manner.

the issues before the judge and his decision thereon 
28     the issues raised by the parties and dealt

                    with by the judge in the court below can be summarised into two main issues. the

                    first concerned the terms and conditions of the hn5 contract. the second was

                    whether the four cera descriptions were different, inconsistent or

                    irreconcilable, or otherwise unworkable such that they rendered the hn5 contract

                    void for uncertainty.
29     with respect to the first main issue, the

                    judge held that the hn5 contract was governed by “the terms and

                    conditions set out on the reverse side of the application form and the entirety of the … pricing statement,

                    including but not limited to the section of the pricing statement entitled

                    ‘terms and conditions of the notes’ and appendix a”

                    [emphasis added] (see [36] of the hc

                    judgment). the respondent has not appealed against this finding, even though it

                    is contrary to its argument in the court below that the terms and conditions of

                    the hn5 contract consisted of only the terms and conditions on the back of the

                    application form and certain portions of the

                    pricing statement.
30     with respect to the second main issue, the

                    judge rejected the appellants’ contention that the cera could not be

                    ascertained due to the four inconsistent cera descriptions present in the

                    pricing statement, and that the hn5 contract was thus void for uncertainty. his

                    reasons for so ruling are set out in the hc judgment as follows:
40    the

                            [appellants’] position in relation to the first three cera

                            descriptions is as follows. it is evident … that all three

                            formulae require the deduction of the caaa and hc. nevertheless, the

                            three are inconsistent because:
(a)    the [f]irst and [s]econd cera descriptions can

                                only be consistent if the prevailing market price of the lehman note

                                is always equal to the nominal value of the reference notes less the

                                loss suffered on the lehman note. however, this is not necessarily

                                always the case as [the] cera would be zero under the [f]irst cera

                                description if the market value of the lehman note were zero, but

                                not necessarily zero [under] the [s]econd cera description as the

                                lehman note was only one of eight reference [obligations] that the

                                hn5 were linked to.
(b)    the [t]hird cera description materially

                                differs on its face from the [f]irst and [s]econd cera descriptions

                                as the component factors it uses are completely different from the

                                latter. it also requires the aggregate principal amount

                                (“apa” or face value) of the reference note[s] to be

                                multiplied by the price of the lehman note expressed as a

                                percentage. yet it fails to say what the price of the lehman note

                                should be expressed as a percentage of – effectively rendering

                                the [t]hird cera description unworkable.
41    the

                            [respondent]’s rebuttal of the [appellants]’ submissions is

                            made on several levels. firstly, it argues that the [f]irst, [s]econd

                            and [t]hird cera descriptions are entirely consistent as they clearly

                            convey that the cera is:
(a)    directly related to the market value of the

                                [d]efault[ed] [r]eference [e]ntity’s reference obligation (in

                                this case, the lehman note).
(b)    inversely related to the shortfall in market

                                value of the caaa and hc.
secondly, the [respondent] argues that the three descriptions relied on by

                        the [appellants] were never intended to be comprehensive formulae. in the

                        event of any uncertainty or inconsistency, the pricing statement provides a

                        clear mechanism for its resolution: the [t]hird cera description is

                        expressly designated the prevailing one.
42    i agree with the

                            [respondent]’s position for the following reasons. the

                            [appellants’] reasoning flows from their having reduced the

                            [f]irst and [s]econd cera descriptions, both expressed in the form of

                            words, into the precise mathematical formulae reproduced in the table at

                            [[27]] above. however, a proper construction of the [f]irst cera

                            description does not convey that level of precision. … the words

                            “based on” do not normally mean “equal to”

                            and the [f]irst cera description, in the context of the paragraph in

                            which it appears[,] does not in fact convey that meaning. what it simply

                            means is that the “prevailing market value of the [d]efaulted

                            reference entity’s reference obligation” will be an

                            important factor in the computation of [the] cera: it does not specify

                            the exact mathematical relationship between the

                            two.
43    the same reasoning

                            applies in the case of the [s]econd cera description. this is found on

                            the fourth page of the pricing statement, in the context of the

                            following paragraph (with the [s]econd cera description

                            emphasised):
for illustrative purposes only, the process adopted upon the

                            occurrence of a credit event under the reference notes is outlined

                            below. this is to illustrate how the [hn5] work and should be treated as

                            an illustration only.
step 1  …
…
step 4  following step 3 above, the

                                calculation agent in respect of the reference notes will determine

                                the [cera] payable to the [respondent], as the holder of the

                                reference notes. the cera is in summary the

                                    amount equal to the nominal value of the reference notes less

                                    the amount of loss suffered on the reference obligation of the

                                    defaulted reference entity less any depreciation of the market

                                    value of the collateral, and less cost and expenses associated

                                    with the termination of the hedging arrangements in respect of

                                    the reference notes.
step 5  ...
…
although the word “equal” is used in this case, this has to

                        be seen in the context of the entire paragraph, particularly the repeated

                        caveats in the two opening sentences that it is for “illustrative

                        purposes” or “illustration” only and the words

                        “in summary” used in the [s]econd cera description itself.

                        furthermore, the expressions “loss suffered”,

                        “depreciation of the market value of the collateral” and

                        “costs and expenses” are not defined at all. it is therefore

                        not correct to reduce it to the second formula in the table at [[27] above] as the [appellants] have done. as

                        with the [f]irst cera description, it [ie, the

                        second cera description] is no more than a general description of the manner

                        in which [the] cera will be determined.
44    the [t]hird cera

                            description appears under the section “summary of the

                            offering” and it is the only one of the three descriptions that

                            sets out an exact formula based on terms that are fully defined.

                            further, in the section entitled “glossary” at p 37

                            of the pricing statement, the following appears:
terms used in the sections on ‘summary of the programme’

                            and ‘summary of the offering’ in the base prospectus and the

                            pricing statement respectively, as the case may be, shall bear the same

                            meanings when used elsewhere in the base prospectus and [the] pricing

                            statement.
45    the foregoing leads

                            to the ineluctable conclusion that the [t]hird cera description is the

                            operative one under the [hn5]

                            contract.
46    i turn now to the

                            [f]ourth cera description. … [t]his is actually the inverse of

                            the [t]hird cera description as well as the general scheme under the

                            [f]irst and [s]econd cera descriptions. the [respondent]’s case is

                            that this is an obvious clerical mistake, which can and should be

                            corrected by construction. it submits as follows:
(a)    the [f]ourth

                                cera description contains a formula that is identical to the [t]hird

                                cera description except for one thing: instead of stating that the

                                apa should be multiplied by the “final price”, it

                                stated that the apa should be multiplied by “(1 –

                                final price)”. it is plain from the other cera [d]escriptions

                                in the pricing statement and the application form that the cera

                                should directly correlate to the market value of the [d]efaulted

                                [r]eference [e]ntity’s reference obligation (ie, the final price). the additional

                                “1 –” in the [f]ourth cera description

                                would result in a negative correlation between the cera and the

                                final price. it is also patently apparent from the other parts of

                                the pricing statement that the cera should be calculated by

                                multiplying the apa with the final price and not

                                “(1 – final price)”:
(i)    at p 9 of the pricing statement,

                                    under the section entitled “risk factors”, the

                                    pricing statement highlights that [a] hn5 [holder] would be

                                    subject to the credit risk of the eight reference entities in

                                    the [hn5] credit basket and goes on to elaborate that the value

                                    of the hn5 “may be affected by the activities undertaken

                                    by the reference entities and any financial or economic

                                    difficulties the reference entities may face”. it is

                                    clear that one of the risks faced by [a] hn5 [holder] is that

                                    “any financial or economic difficulties the reference

                                    entities may face” would have a negative effect on the

                                    value of the hn5 (and, therefore, the cera, if a [c]redit

                                    [e]vent occurs); and
(ii)   the illustrations provided at p 8 of

                                    the pricing statement under “scenario analyses”

                                    put the issue beyond doubt. it is explained in scenario 3

                                    (worst case scenario) that if a [c]redit [e]vent occurs under

                                    the reference notes, and if the market value of the relevant

                                    reference obligation is zero, the hn5 will terminate immediately

                                    and the [hn5 holder] will receive a zero payout. this can only

                                    be true if the cera is calculated by multiplying the apa with

                                    final price (ie, the market value

                                    of the relevant reference obligation which is zero) and not

                                    “(1 – final price)”.
(b)    a literal reading of the formula contained in

                                the [f]ourth cera description would give rise to an absurdity. the

                                cera under the reference notes (and therefore the cera for the hn5)

                                would have an inverse correlation to the final price. as a result,

                                the lower the prevailing market value of the [d]efaulted [r]eference

                                [e]ntity’s reference obligation, the more the [respondent]

                                would receive as the reference notes cera and the higher the amount

                                each hn5 [holder] would receive upon the occurrence of a [c]redit

                                [e]vent. this could not by any stretch of the imagination have been

                                the intention of the [respondent] or the hn5 [holders] when the hn5

                                contract was entered into. in fact, the [appellants] do not make any

                                such suggestion. in investing in [the] hn5 and in return for the

                                higher interest yield of the hn5, the [hn5 holder] agreed to take on

                                the risk, inter alia, of any financial

                                difficulties which the eight reference entities in the [hn5] credit

                                basket may face. if the hn5 [holder]’s returns increased with

                                the depreciation of the market value of the [d]efaulted [r]eference

                                [e]ntity’s reference obligation, that would completely turn

                                the risk which was undertaken and accepted by the hn5 [holder] in

                                the hn5 contract on its head.
47    i agree with the

                            [respondent]’s submission regarding the [f]ourth cera description.

                            there is no doubt in my mind that it is a clerical mistake. the

                            conditions for correcting an obvious clerical mistake by the process of

                            construction were laid down by brightman lj in east v pantiles (plant hire) ltd [1982] 2 eglr 111

                            at 112, as follows:
… two conditions must be satisfied: first, there must be a

                            clear mistake on the face of the instrument; secondly, it must be clear

                            what correction ought to be made in order to cure the mistake. if those

                            conditions are satisfied, then the correction is made as a matter of

                            construction …

48    i find that there is ample basis for correcting the

                            [f]ourth cera description by the removal of the

                            “1 –” in the formula. to the extent that the

                            [f]ourth cera description contradicts the [t]hird cera description, this

                            would eliminate that contradiction.
[emphasis in original]
31     in summary, the judge accepted the

                    respondent’s arguments and held that the third cera description was the

                    operative cera description because it was precise and was expressed in the form

                    of a mathematical formula, whereas the first and second cera descriptions were

                    verbal formulations and were therefore imprecise. the judge also accepted the

                    respondent’s argument that contextually, the fourth cera description

                    contained an obvious clerical mistake, in that a literal reading of the formula

                    set out therein would give rise to an absurdity. the judge further held that the

                    clerical mistake could be corrected simply by construing the fourth cera

                    description by removing “1 –” (which was the cause of

                    the mistake). applying the formulation set out in the third cera description,

                    the judge held that the appellants were entitled to only a zero

                payout.
the issues to be decided in this appeal
32     the appellants raised two issues

                    (collectively, “the issues”) before us for decision. the first was

                    whether the judge was right in ruling that the third cera description was the

                    operative cera description (“the first issue”). the second was,

                    regardless of whether it was the third or the fourth cera description (these

                    being the only two cera descriptions addressed by the appellants on appeal)

                    which was the operative cera description, whether the hn5 contract was void for

                    uncertainty because both the third and fourth cera descriptions were unworkable

                    in that they did not provide any agreed basis for calculating the cera

                    (“the second issue”).
the parties’ arguments on the issues 
the appellants’ case 
33     the appellants’ arguments before us on

                    the issues were basically a reiteration of those arguments that had been

                    rejected by the judge.
34     with respect to the fourth cera description,

                    the appellants argued that the formula set out in it was not absurd and would

                    not lead to an absurd result because:
(a)     under that formula, in the event of

                        a credit event occurring, a hn5 holder would sustain significant losses of

                        approximately 72% of the principal sum invested; and
(b)     upon the occurrence of a

                        “constellation event” (ie, early

                        redemption of the reference notes for any reason other than the occurrence

                        of a credit event or an “issuer call” (viz, the exercise by the respondent of its right of early

                        redemption of the hn5)), assuming the same factual conditions as those in

                        the present appeal applied, the payout which a hn5 holder would receive

                        would be the same as that which he would receive under the fourth cera

                        description.
hence, the appellants contended, the fourth

                    cera description did not contain any obvious clerical mistake. it followed that

                    the judge was not entitled to correct or rectify that cera description to make

                    it consistent with the third cera description as the conditions for correction

                    by construction as laid down in east v pantiles (plant hire)

                        ltd [1982] 2 eglr 111 were not satisfied.
35     the appellants further argued that regardless

                    of whether this court were to uphold the judge’s decision that the third

                    cera description was the operative cera description or, alternatively, rule that

                    the fourth cera description was the operative one, neither of these cera

                    descriptions was workable as one of the elements common to both descriptions

                    –

                    ie, the final price – could not be

                    calculated and, therefore, the cera could not be ascertained. the reason, the

                    appellants explained, was that “final price” was defined under

                    both the third and fourth cera descriptions as the price of the defaulted

                    reference entity’s reference obligation “expressed as a

                        percentage”.[note: 32] however, as

                    the phrase “expressed as a percentage”[note: 33]

                    was nowhere defined in the pricing statement, there was no denominator that

                    could be used to express the price of the lehman note (the defaulted reference

                    entity’s reference obligation in the present case) as a

                percentage.
36     in support of their legal arguments on the

                    issue of uncertainty, the appellants referred to foley v

                        classique coaches, limited [1934] 2 kb 1 and also

                        may and butcher, limited v the king [1934]

                    2 kb 17. in the latter, the house of lords held (per viscount dunedin at 21) in the context of a contract of

                    sale:
… [u]ndoubtedly price is one of the essentials of sale, and if it

                        is left still to be agreed between the parties, then there is no

                        contract.
37     the appellants’ counsel contended that

                    the present case was one of conceptual uncertainty and not mere difficulty of

                    application, relying on megarry j’s analysis in brown v gould and others [1972] 1 ch 53 at 56–57

                    (citing the unreported case of in re lloyd’s trust

                        instruments (24 june 1970)) as follows:
… i think the starting point on any question of uncertainty must be

                        that of the court’s reluctance to hold an instrument void for

                        uncertainty. … the second question is that of the types of

                        uncertainty. the basic type (and on one view the only true type) is

                        uncertainty of concept, as contrasted with mere difficulty of application

                        … in fawcett’s case [viz, fawcett properties ltd v

                            buckingham county council] [1961] a.c. 636, 670,

                        lord keith of avonholm said: ‘the point is one of uncertainty of

                        concept. if it is impossible, on construction of the condition, to reach a

                        conclusion as to what was in the draftsman’s mind, the condition is

                        meaningless and must be read as pro non scripto.’ putting it another

                        way, the question is one of linguistic or semantic uncertainty, and not of

                        difficulty of ascertainment …
38     according to the appellants, the present case

                    was one of uncertainty of concept because:
(a)     the third and fourth cera

                        descriptions were inconsistent with each other;
(b)     there was no way to determine conclusively which

                        of these two cera descriptions was intended by the parties to be the

                        operative cera description; and
(c)     both of these cera descriptions were unworkable because

                        they referred to the final price, which could not be determined as it had

                        been expressed as a percentage without a

                        denominator.
the respondent’s case
39     the respondent’s arguments on the issues

                    were likewise substantially a reiteration of their arguments in the court below.

                    it was contended that the threshold to be satisfied before a court would declare

                    a contract (particularly a fully-performed one such as the hn5 contract) void

                    for uncertainty was very high and, as such, voiding a contract for uncertainty

                    should be a measure of last resort. reference was made to g scammell and nephew, limited v h c and

                        j g ouston [1941] ac 251, where the house of

                    lords held that it was only where the words of a contract, “considered

                    however broadly and untechnically and with due regard to all the just

                    implications, fail[ed] to evince any definite meaning on which the court [could]

                    safely act … that the court ha[d] no choice but to say that there [was]

                    no contract” (at 268 per lord wright).

                    the respondent also referred to sudbrook trading estate ltd v

                        eggleton and others [1983] 1 ac 444 in support of its

                    contention that the threshold for voiding a contract was even higher in the case

                    of executed (as opposed to executory) contracts. in that case, lord fraser

                    of tullybelton, quoting a passage from the english court of appeal’s

                    judgment in the same case, said (at 484):
where an agreement which would otherwise be unenforceable for want of

                        certainty or finality in an essential stipulation has been partly performed

                        so that the intervention of the court is necessary in aid of a grant that

                        has already taken effect, the court will strain to the utmost to supply the

                        want of certainty even to the extent of providing a substitute

                        machinery.
40     on the basis of these authorities, the

                    respondent argued that the high threshold for voiding a contract for uncertainty

                    had not been satisfied vis-à-vis the hn5 contract

                    for the following reasons:
(a)     the first and second cera

                        descriptions were no more than general descriptions and were never intended

                        to be comprehensive formulae.
(b)     in any event, the first, second and third cera

                        descriptions were accurate, consistent and reconcilable with each

                        other.
(c)     the

                        pricing statement expressly designated the formula contained in the third

                        cera description as the prevailing formula to resolve any

                        uncertainty.
(d)     there was ample basis for correcting the obvious clerical mistake in the

                        fourth cera description through construction by removing

                        “1 –” from the description such that it would

                        become consistent with the first, second and third cera

                    descriptions.
(e)     there

                        was no uncertainty about the fact that the cera to be received by hn5

                        holders would be an amount equal to the cera under the reference notes as

                        calculated by the respondent (as the calculation agent) and received by the

                        respondent (as the holder of the reference notes).
(f)     in any event, the pricing statement

                        stated that the calculation of the cera by the respondent was, in the

                        absence of manifest error, binding on both the respondent and hn5

                        holders.
our decision on the issues 
the first issue: the four cera descriptions
41     with respect to the first issue, which stems

                    from the alleged inconsistencies between and among the four cera descriptions in

                    the pricing statement, we agree with the judge that the first and second cera

                    descriptions are verbal descriptions, but we do not agree that they are

                    imprecise for that reason alone. we see no difficulty in expressing them in

                    mathematical formulae as follows:

first cera

                                    description

=

mv – (caaa +

                                    hc)

(where “mv” refers to the

                                            market value of the lehman note)

second cera

                                    description

=

(nv – l) – (caaa +

                                        hc)

(where “nv” refers to the

                                            nominal value of the reference notes and

                                            “l” refers to the loss on the lehman

                                            note)

so expressed, it is clear that the first cera description is different

                    from the second cera description, and both are different from the third cera

                    description and also the fourth cera description.
42     it should be noted that before both the judge

                    and this court, the respondent did not expressly disagree that the first, second

                    and third cera descriptions were expressed differently from one another. rather,

                    its argument, as summarised by the judge in the hc judgment at [41] and which it reiterated before us, was

                    that these three cera descriptions clearly conveyed that the cera was:
(a)     directly related to the market value

                        of the lehman note (the defaulted reference entity’s reference

                        obligation in this case); and
(b)     inversely related to the shortfall in the market value of

                        the caaa and the hc.
on the other hand, the respondent

                    insisted that the fourth cera description was inconsistent with the third cera

                    description as the former implied an inverse relationship between the cera and

                    the market value of the lehman note, which made the relationship absurd and,

                    therefore, one that could not have been intended. hence, the respondent argued,

                    the fourth cera description must contain a clerical mistake.
43     in our view, the respondent’s arguments

                    as summarised in the preceding paragraph have not addressed the point that the

                    first, second and third cera descriptions are formulated differently from one

                    another, in that although they use (in substance) the same factors to calculate

                    the cera, they phrase these factors differently. consequently, an issue does

                    arise as to whether these three cera descriptions may produce different ceras

                    (or payouts) in the event of a credit event and, if so, which would be the

                    operative cera description even if the fourth cera description were disregarded

                    for this purpose. we will now analyse the four cera descriptions.
the first cera description
44     in our view, given that the market value of

                    the lehman note was only 0.005% of its nominal value, it is clear that the

                    application of the first cera description would in effect result in a zero

                    payout for hn5 holders as the computation of the cera would yield a negative

                    figure.
the second cera description
45     in contrast, we are of the view that the

                    literal application of the second cera description would not result in a zero

                    payout for hn5 holders if constellation had not

                    invested the reference notes funds in the lehman note as, in that event, it

                    would not have suffered any loss arising from lehman’s bankruptcy. in that

                    scenario, the cera payout would be calculated as follows:


for the sgd tranche of the

                                            hn5


[{us$3,283.21[note: 34] (nv of the

                                            reference notes) – us$0 (no loss on the lehman

                                            note)} – {us$2,358.99[note: 35]

                                            hc)}] × s$1.5067[note: 37]

                                            s$1.5067

= s$1,392.52

                                            note)] – [us$3,592.50[note: 39]

= us$1,407.50

46     on the above calculation, the second cera

                    description would result in a cera of s$1,392.52 for each hn5 under the sgd

                    tranche and a cera of us$1,407.50 for each hn5 under the usd tranche.

                    notes funds in the lehman note, the cera under the second cera description would

                    be the same as the cera under the fourth cera description. it follows that the

                    second cera description would contain a mistake in the same way that the fourth

                    cera description is alleged by the respondent to contain a clerical

                    mistake.
47     the difficulty with the literal application of

                    the second cera description is that it assumes that the pricing statement

                    required constellation to invest all or substantially all of the reference notes

                    funds in one or more of the reference obligations as it is only in this scenario

                    that the cera under the reference notes (and, in turn, the cera under the hn5)

                    would have a direct one-to-one correlation with the value of the reference

                    obligations. this is, however, not the case as nowhere in the pricing statement

                    was it stated that constellation was required to invest the reference notes

                    funds in any of the reference obligations. the reference obligations were used

                    only for the purpose of triggering a credit event. in other words, the reference

                    obligations were merely notional obligations and not real obligations. but, as

                    mentioned at [18] above, this is clear only

                    upon a close analysis of the terms of the pricing statement.
the third cera description
48     the third cera description provides a precise

                    mathematical formula to work out the cera payable to hn5 holders upon the

                    termination of the hn5 resulting from a credit event. it is not disputed that

                    the formula set out in the third cera description will result in hn5 holders

                    receiving a zero payout in the present case as the calculation, which both

                    parties accept, is as follows:


for the sgd tranche of the

                                            hn5


[{us$3,283.21[note: 41]

                                            (apa of the reference notes) x 0.005%[note: 42]

                                            (fp of the lehman note expressed as a percentage)}

                                            – us$2,358.99[note: 43] (caaa)

                                            – us$0[note: 44] (no

                                            hc)] x s$1.5067[note: 45]

                                            (prevailing exchange rate)

= (us$0.16 – us$2,358.99 –

                                            us$0) x s$1.5067

= –s$3,554.05, or s$0 (for the

                                            purposes of determining the cera)


for the usd tranche of the

                                            hn5


[us$5,000[note: 46] (apa of the

                                            reference notes) x 0.005%[note: 47] (fp of

                                            the lehman note expressed as a percentage)] –

                                                us$3,592.50[note: 48] (caaa)

                                            – us$0[note: 49] (no

                                            hc)

= us$0.25 – us$3,592.50 –

                                            us$0

= –us$3,592.25 (again, in effect, a

                                            payout of us$0)

49     the application of the third cera description

                    actually gives a negative result for the cera, which, in practical terms, means

                    a zero payout for hn5 holders. the absurdity of this theoretical result can only

                    be explained on the basis that the third cera description is so constructed as

                    to virtually guarantee that on the occurrence of a credit event, hn5 holders

                    will get nothing back on their capital “investment”.
the fourth cera description
50     it is the respondent’s case that the

                    fourth cera description contains a clerical mistake because the application of

                    the formula set out therein would lead to an absurd result, in that the lower

                    the value of the defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation (as

                    assessed by prospective investors in the relevant security), the higher the cera

                    to be paid to hn5 holders. before both the judge and this court, the respondent

                    did not explain how the mistake came about – an omission which we find

                    surprising, given that the respondent’s army of advisers would presumably

                    have examined the pricing statement, especially the cera descriptions therein,

                    with meticulous care. we earlier examined the second cera description, and found

                    that it too could be said to contain a mistake as it would, if applied

                    literally, give the same result as the fourth cera description. it seems

                    incredible that in the context of such a humongous structured note programme as

                    the hn5, the respondent could have failed to detect two serious errors in the

                    description of the cera, which may be said to lie at the heart of hn5

                    holders’ “investment” in the event of a credit event

                    occurring and which formed a key part of the basis on which the respondent

                    invited applications for the hn5.
which is the operative cera description?
51     the appellants’ case is based entirely

                    on principles of contract law and not on facts. it rests, in essence, on two

                    arguments, namely: (a) the four cera descriptions are inconsistent with one

                    another, thereby rendering the cera uncertain; and (b) in any event,

                    regardless of whether it is the third or the fourth cera description which is

                    the operative cera description, the cera is unascertainable because the formulae

                    in both the third and fourth cera descriptions are unworkable. consequently, it

                    is contended, the hn5 contract is void ab initio

                    for uncertainty. we are unable to accept both arguments for the reasons given

                    below.
52     we have established that:
(a)     the first cera description is in

                        substance the same as the third cera description in so far as both will

                        give, for practical purposes, a zero payout;
(b)     the second cera description, if applied

                        literally, will give the same payout as the fourth cera description in the

                        circumstances of this case; and
(c)     the first and third cera descriptions are therefore

                        inconsistent with the second and fourth cera

                descriptions.
53     in our view, the pricing statement can only

                    stipulate one operative cera description for the purposes of the hn5 contract,

                    and the question of which of the four (or two sets of) cera descriptions is the

                    operative one is a question of fact that can and should be ascertained from the

                    evidence which has been or can be made available to the court. in our view, it

                    would not be wise or correct for us to decide the first issue on the basis of

                    preferring one set of legal arguments to another when the real dispute between

                    the parties is really a question of fact as to what the operative cera

                    description is. we know that the pricing statement states clearly that the cera

                    which hn5 holders will get upon the occurrence of a credit event is the cera

                    which the respondent will get under the reference notes (see [8] above). we know that the reference notes exist,

                    although their full terms have not been disclosed to the court. we know that the

                    respondent has alleged that the fourth cera description contains a clerical

                    mistake. hence, to ascertain whether the judge was right in ruling that the

                    third cera description was the operative cera description, all that we need to

                    do is to look at the terms and conditions of the contract applicable to the

                    reference notes to see whether the formula for calculating the cera under the

                    reference notes (which, as we have just reiterated, is also the cera to be paid

                    to hn5 holders) is the same as the formula set out in the third cera

                    description. in short, the operative cera description can be conclusively

                    established by examining the material facts.
54     in this connection, neither the appellants nor

                    the respondent appeared to be keen to have the reference notes and the relevant

                    accompanying documents (collectively, “the reference notes

                    documents”) disclosed to this court, even though we suggested, in the

                    course of hearing this appeal, that such disclosure would be helpful to the

                    court. we made this suggestion as we were effectively being asked to decide an

                    issue of fact (albeit presented by the parties as an issue of law) without

                    having before us all the material evidence pertaining to that issue of fact.

                    there were other factors which prompted us to make this suggestion. firstly, the

                    hn5 are a novel and complex financial product. as such, the court should be slow

                    to decide what the operative cera description is based purely on legal

                    arguments. secondly, the pricing statement (consisting of 93 pages of

                    explanatory statements), which forms a key plank of the hn5 contract, would

                    presumably have been carefully vetted by teams of lawyers and bankers. as such,

                    we were not prepared to accept, without further scrutiny, the respondent’s

                    argument that the fourth cera description contained a clerical error. thirdly,

                    it seemed to us that if the fourth cera description did indeed contain a

                    clerical mistake, then the second cera description would also contain a mistake

                    as the second cera description, applied literally, would give the same result as

                    the fourth cera description if constellation had not actually invested the

                    reference notes funds in the lehman note (see [46] above). that two mistakes could have been made in the

                    pricing statement seemed to us (as mentioned at [50] above) incredible and called for further inquiry. fourthly,

                    if the formula for calculating the cera as set out in the reference notes

                    documents is the same as the fourth cera description, then the fourth cera

                    description, and not the third cera description, would be the operative cera

                    description. this is because the pricing statement states very clearly that the

                    cera to be paid to hn5 holders in the event of a credit event would be the same

                    as the cera received by the respondent under the reference notes. in that

                    scenario (ie, if the fourth cera description is

                    the operative cera description), given the undeniable and irreconcilable

                    inconsistency between the third and fourth cera descriptions, it would be the

                    third cera description, and not the fourth, which contains a clerical

                    error.
55     in view of the above considerations, we

                    directed the respondent (notwithstanding both parties’ apparent

                    reluctance) to produce for our consideration, inter

                        alia, the reference notes documents. these documents, which were

                    furnished on 11 july 2011, included:
(a)     the pricing supplement dated

                        16 may 2007 for srn series 75;
(b)     the pricing supplement dated 16 may 2007

                        for srn series 76;
(c)     the swap confirmation dated 16 may 2007 for srn

                        series 75; and
(d)     the swap confirmation dated 16 may 2007 for srn

                        series 76.
it should be noted that when producing

                    the documents ordered by this court, the respondent drew the attention of the

                    appellants’ solicitors to the application of the principle laid down in

                        riddick v thames board mills ltd

                    [1977] qb 881 as well as the implied undertaking: (a) not to

                    disclose the reference notes documents to any third party, and (b) not to

                    use them, without the consent of this court, for any purpose other than in the

                    present proceedings. in this regard, we confirm that the implied undertaking

                    subsists and is not to be breached in any way.
56     having perused the reference notes documents,

                    we observe that the formula for calculating the cera under the reference notes

                    (and, thus, the formula for calculating the cera under the hn5) is consistently

                    stated across several of the documents to be the formula under the third cera

                    description –

                    ie, the cera description with respect to the

                    reference notes is the same as the third cera description. accordingly, we

                    conclude that the operative cera description for the purposes of the hn5 is

                    indeed, as the judge held, the third cera description (which description, in our

                    view, the first cera description was intended to express, albeit in verbal and

                    less precise terms). we also accept the respondent’s argument that the

                    fourth cera description contains a clerical mistake, although how this mistake

                    (and also the mistake in the second cera description) came about remains a

                    mystery.
57     in the circumstances, the legal arguments

                    advanced by the appellants’ counsel on the issue of conceptual uncertainty

                    in the terms of the hn5 contract are not applicable. the appellants’

                    allegation of uncertainty in a critical term of the hn5 contract (viz, the term relating to the cera) must, therefore,

                    fail. the result is that owing to lehman’s bankruptcy, the cera payable to

                    hn5 holders on their investment is indeed zero.
the second issue: the definition of “final

                price”
58     we will now consider the second issue, which

                    concerns the appellants’ argument that both the third and fourth cera

                    descriptions are not workable as the words “expressed as a

                        percentage”[note: 50] in the

                    definition of “final price” for both of these cera descriptions do

                    not specify a denominator to give the said percentage (“the fp

                    percentage”) a value.
59     the appellants’ submissions on this

                    issue were as follows. first, there was no evidence that the parties intended,

                    knew or understood that the denominator for the fp percentage would be the

                    nominal value of the lehman note. second, using the nominal value of the lehman

                    note as the denominator for the fp percentage would only make sense if it were

                    assumed that all of the reference notes funds were allocated to the lehman note;

                    otherwise, there was no logical reason to assume that the loss suffered on those

                    funds would be proportionate to the fall in value of the lehman

                note.
60     in rebuttal, the respondent contended that the

                    denominator for the fp percentage was the outstanding principal balance of the

                    defaulted reference entity’s reference obligation (ie, the lehman note). this interpretation, the respondent

                    submitted, was borne out by the definitions of “final price” and

                    other related terms in appendix d of the pricing statement, which

                    definitions the third cera description expressly referred the reader to (see the

                    quotation at [25] above), and was also based

                    squarely on the terms and definitions set out in the pricing statement. the

                    material terms and definitions in this regard are as follows:
(a)     “final price”, which

                        is defined as “the price of the reference obligation of the defaulted

                        reference entity expressed as a percentage, determined in

                            accordance with the valuation method”[note: 51] [emphasis

                    added];
(b)     “valuation method”, which is defined as “the market value determined by the calculation agent

                            [ie, the respondent] with respect to the

                        valuation date [viz, a date falling within 80

                        business days from the “credit event determination date”,

                        which is the date on which a credit event notice, delivered in accordance

                        with the terms of the hn5 contract, is effective]”[note: 52] [emphasis

                    added];
(c)     “market value”, which is defined as, essentially, the

                        arithmetic mean of “full

                            quotation[s]”[note: 53]

                        [emphasis added] obtained by the respondent as the calculation

                    agent;
(d)     “full

                        quotation”, which is defined as “in accordance with the

                        quotation method [ie, the bidding method],

                        each firm quotation obtained from a dealer at the valuation time [viz, approximately 11.00am singapore time], to the

                        extent reasonably practicable, for an amount of the reference obligation

                            with an outstanding principal balance equal to the

                            quotation amount”[note: 54] [emphasis added];

                    and
(e)     “quotation amount”, which is defined as “the [apa] of

                        the notes [ie, the reference notes]

                            outstanding”.[note: 55]
61     in our view, in the context of the formulae

                    under the third and fourth cera descriptions, the fp (final price) is the market

                    value of the lehman note expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the

                    lehman note. since the lehman note lost 99.995% of its nominal value, the fp

                    percentage would be 0.005% (of the nominal value of the lehman note). the words

                    “expressed as a percentage” in the definition of “final

                    price” mean expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount

                    (apa) of the reference notes, which the nominal value of the defaulted reference

                    entity’s reference obligation is equated with. this interpretation is

                    consistent with the artificial and complex structure of the hn5, whose terms

                    provide that the entire principal amount of the reference notes (ie, all of the reference notes funds) is notionally

                    allocated to the defaulted reference entity. in our view, the words

                    “expressed as a percentage” cannot mean anything else. this is not

                    a case of words having no meaning at all. it is, rather, a case of construing

                    the relevant contractual documents to determine the intended denominator to be

                    used for calculating the cera under the hn5. accordingly, we are of the view

                    that contrary to the appellants’ submission, there is no conceptual

                    uncertainty in the words “expressed as a percentage” in the

                    definition of “final price”. we would also add that considering

                    the enormous number of words already used in the pricing statement to set out

                    the terms of the hn5, the respondent’s advisers could and should simply

                    have added a few more words to give the phrase “expressed as a

                    percentage” greater clarity. this would have made the definition of

                    “final price” more intelligible, and would in turn have averted

                    the obfuscation which gave rise to the second issue.
conclusion
62     for the reasons given above, we agree with the

                    judge that the hn5 contract is not void for uncertainty. accordingly, we dismiss

                    the appeal with costs (but not the costs of producing the reference notes

                    documents) and the usual consequential orders.
observations 
63     in view of our decision in this appeal, we

                    think it apposite and timely to remind the general public that under the law of

                    contract, a person who signs a contract which is set out in a language he is not

                    familiar with or whose terms he may not understand is nonetheless bound by the

                    terms of that contract. illiteracy, whether linguistic, financial or general,

                    does not enable a contracting party to avoid a contract whose terms he has

                    expressly agreed to be bound by. the principle of caveat

                        emptor applies equally to literates and illiterates in such

                    circumstances.
