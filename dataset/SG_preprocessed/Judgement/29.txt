application by the law society of singapore (the “law society”) for the respondent, mr cheng kim kuan (“mr cheng”), to be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the legal profession act 1966 (2020 rev ed) (“lpa”). the law society also seeks an order for the costs of and incidental to the action, including the costs of the proceedings before the disciplinary tribunal (“dt”) to be paid by mr cheng. 2 the misconduct in issue arose out of a solicitor’s written undertaking dated 12 may 2021 (the “undertaking”) that mr cheng gave to the council of the law society and the supreme court of singapore in which mr cheng undertook to be the supervising solicitor for a fellow solicitor, mr ravi s/o madasamy (“mr ravi”). the law society alleged that mr cheng breached the undertaking by failing to supervise mr ravi and to ensure that mr ravi abided by the conditions (the “conditions”) imposed on the practicing certificate issued to mr ravi for practice year 2021/2022 (the “conditional practicing certificate”). the law society further alleged that mr cheng’s breach of the undertaking constituted breaches of rr 8(3) and 13(4) of the legal profession (professional conduct) rules 2015 (“pcr”) and that amounted to: (a) grossly improper conduct in the discharge of mr cheng’s professional duty within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the lpa and (b) misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the supreme court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the lpa. 3 before the dt, the law society preferred six principal charges and six alternative charges against mr cheng. the dt found cause of sufficient gravity existed in relation to two out of the six charges. these were the first and the third charges and their alternatives. 4 before us, mr cheng indicated through his counsel that he was pleading guilty to the two charges in question and was not contesting the dt’s finding that cause of sufficient gravity existed. we agreed with the dt that cause for disciplinary action existed in respect of the first and the third charges. we imposed a six-month suspension on mr cheng. we now set out the reasons for our decision.the charges5 the first and the third charges against mr cheng, which were framed in the alternative under ss 83(2)(b) and 83(2)(h) of the lpa, read as follows:first charge and alternative first chargeyou, cheng kim kuan, an advocate and solicitor of the supreme court of singapore, are charged that from 12 may 2021 to 19 november 2021, despite paragraph 2a of [the undertaking] given to

member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the legal profession act 1966.6 as the remaining four charges and their alternatives were no longer in issue, it is not necessary to set out these charges in full. in summary, these four charges concerned other alleged breaches by mr cheng of the undertaking. for instance, his alleged failure to seek the leave of the

(d) mr cheng clarified that mr ravi did not hold any position in kkcl and that mr ravi ran his legal practice as a “chamber” under kkcl. further, mr ravi devised and issued the letterhead, invoice form and receipt for his legal practice at the high street centre office and mr cheng was not involved.(e) mr cheng clarified that although kkcl had a client account, mr ravi’s client monies were not deposited into that account. mr cheng also provided details of the manner in which monies from mr ravi’s clients were paid out to mr ravi from kkcl’s office accounts.the proceedings before the dt and the dt’s findings24 following the exchange of correspondence detailed above, the attorney-general brought a complaint against mr cheng for breach of the undertaking to the council of the law society of singapore pursuant to s 85(3) of the lpa. on 20 july 2022, the dt was appointed to hear and investigate the complaint.25 in the proceedings before the dt, mr cheng claimed trial to all six primary charges and their respective alternatives. the key issues for the dt were whether: (a) the elements of each charge were made out; (b) mr cheng’s conduct fell within ss 83(2)(b) or 83(2)(h) of the lpa; and (c) cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the lpa.the parties’ respective positions before the dt26 as the focus of oa 2 was on the first and third charges, it is sufficient for us to state the positions taken by the law society and by mr cheng with respect to these charges before the dt. 27 the gravamen of the first charge was premised on paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking which states that mr cheng “shall personally supervise [mr ravi]’s practise as an advocate and solicitor in [kkcl]”. the law society submitted that mr cheng had breached paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking by allowing mr ravi to have sole conduct of his own legal matters without any supervision on mr cheng’s part. 28 as for the third charge, the law society contended that mr cheng had breached paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking which states that mr cheng “shall provide to the [the law society] and [the agc] a monthly report within the first working day of every calendar month … attesting to whether [mr ravi] has complied with all applicable professional conduct rules and that no complaint in relation to [mr ravi]’s professional conduct has been received”. the law society submitted that there was a clear breach of paragraph 2(b) on mr cheng’s part when he failed to submit the monthly report detailing his supervision of mr ravi for the month of november 2021 (the “november 2021 report”) by the stipulated deadline of 1 december 2021.29 mr cheng contended that the elements for both charges were not made out. the gist of mr cheng’s defence for the first charge was that he understood his obligation under paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking as meaning that he had to exercise general oversight over mr ravi’s compliance with the pcr. mr cheng further argued that he had complied with this obligation through his handling of the monies paid by mr ravi’s clients as well as by arranging for the 19 november meeting after he was aware of the 17 november 2021 letter. 30 as for the third charge, mr cheng did not deny breaching paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking. instead, his primary argument was that the circumstances had rendered it unnecessary for the november 2021 report to be submitted. according to mr cheng, the 17 november 2021 letter had apprised all the relevant parties of the issues relating to mr ravi’s professional conduct. mr cheng therefore believed it was no longer necessary to file the november 2021 report since it would merely repeat the issues pertaining to mr ravi which were already known to everyone.the dt’s findings31 in its report dated 17 february 2023 (the “dt report”), the dt determined under s 93(1)(c) of the lpa that the first and third charges were made out and that cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action to be taken against mr cheng:(a) in respect of the first charge, the dt found that mr cheng made no attempts to supervise mr ravi. mr cheng knew nothing about mr ravi’s practice and had no idea what mr ravi was working on during the material period in question. mr ravi also did not operate out of the same premises as kkcl. instead, mr ravi was given free reign over all aspects of his legal practice, including the freedom to hire his own employees. mr cheng’s complete failure to exercise supervision over mr ravi, contrary to his obligations under the undertaking, would certainly constitute grossly improper conduct.(b) in respect of the third charge, mr cheng’s failure to submit the november 2021 report, despite the clear, unambiguous and unqualified obligation pursuant to the undertaking, was a breach of the undertaking. he “deliberately chose not to submit the november 2021 report”.(c) the dt was further satisfied that mr cheng’s conduct in relation to the alternative charges to the first and third charges would also constitute conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the lpa.32 the dt dismissed the remaining four charges and their alternatives as it was not satisfied that the law society had established sufficiently the requisite elements of the charges.33 pursuant to the dt report, the law society filed oa 2 for an order that mr cheng be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the lpa in respect of the first and third charges.the parties’ submissions before the court the law society’s submissions34 the law society did not dispute the dt’s dismissal of the second, fourth, fifth and sixth charges and their alternatives. its position was that due cause in respect of the first and third charges was made out against mr cheng. the law society further submitted that suspension from practice for six to eight months was the appropriate sanction to impose on mr cheng for the following reasons:(a) a fine was insufficient as: (i) public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession had been undermined as a result of mr cheng’s conduct; and (ii) aggravating factors were present in mr cheng’s conduct. (b) a striking-off was not warranted as: (i) mr cheng’s misconduct did not render him unfit to be a member of the legal profession; (ii) mr cheng had not demonstrated any blatant disregard of the law or exhibited any predatory instincts; and (iii) mr cheng’s infractions were not so severe to have brought grave dishonour to the entire legal profession. mr cheng’s submissions35 mr cheng, on the other hand, did not deny that the dt found correctly that the elements of the first and third charges were made out. before us, his counsel indicated that mr cheng was pleading guilty to these charges. his counsel submitted that a fine was the appropriate sanction in respect of both charges as mr cheng’s breaches of the undertaking were not deliberate but were ultimately a result of his “grave misjudgment”. 36 for the first charge, mr cheng argued that his breach of paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking arose from his erroneous understanding of the extent of supervision and was not a deliberate breach. as for the third charge, mr cheng argued that the breach of paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking similarly arose from his erroneous understanding regarding the need to file the november 2021 report. he had assumed that there was no need to file the said report as all the relevant parties were aware of the complaints made against mr ravi as set out in the 17 november 2021 letter. 37 mr cheng also submitted that there were relevant mitigating factors to take into account. in particular, he did not receive any benefit from undertaking to act as mr ravi’s supervising solicitor and his current predicament arose simply because of “his genuine desire to help mr ravi”. 38 mr cheng submitted, in the alternative, that a one-month suspension would be appropriate. he argued that the suspension suggested by the law society would be manifestly excessive in the light of the mitigating factors.  the issue39 as mr cheng did not dispute that the two charges were made out, the sole issue for our consideration was the appropriate sanction to impose under s 83(1) of the lpa.our decisiondue cause was established40 for completeness, we set out our reasons why we agreed with the dt that due cause was established on the facts.41 both the first and third charges and their alternatives concerned mr cheng’s breach of the undertaking. the principles relating to a solicitor’s breach of his undertaking are well-established. the starting point is to appreciate the nature of an undertaking given by a solicitor. in law society of singapore v naidu priyalatha [2022] sghc 224 (“naidu priyalatha”), the court (at [1]) described an undertaking given by a solicitor as:a cast‑iron guarantee, practically a sacred vow. once it is given, other practitioners will govern their conduct in reliance on it. such undertakings are indispensable to the speedy and efficient transaction of legal business including the handling of litigation. due to the respect lay persons and other lawyers accord an undertaking, its breach by the undertaking solicitor can lead to serious consequences. breach of an undertaking is, therefore, almost invariably an act of professional misconduct. …42 in re lim kiap khee; law society of singapore v lim kiap khee [2001] 2 slr(r) 398 (“lim kiap khee”), the court emphasised (at [21]):it is of the utmost importance that a solicitor should abide by the undertaking he formally gives. it is the very foundation of an honourable profession that its members act honourably. to deliberately breach an undertaking solemnly given would seriously undermine the integrity of the profession and would bring it into disrepute. such a conduct, in our opinion, clearly constitutes grossly improper conduct …43 the sacrosanct status of a solicitor’s undertaking is such that “the average person and even the court may rely on it without question” and a “solicitor should only give an undertaking with which she is able to comply. once given, there is no turning back”. accordingly, a breach of a solicitor’s undertaking will have to be “met with the strongest disapprobation from the profession” and not doing so would erode the trust and confidence placed on a solicitor’s undertaking: see naidu priyalatha at [32]. it will also give rise to a prima facie cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action: see naidu priyalatha at [40].44 the first charge and its alternative alleged that mr cheng breached paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking by failing to supervise mr ravi’s legal practice as an advocate and solicitor in kkcl. it was not disputed that mr cheng allowed mr ravi to have sole discretion in the conduct of his legal cases, without any supervision by mr cheng. this included: (a) permitting mr ravi to take sole charge of his legal cases without observing or assessing mr ravi in the course of his legal practice and (b) permitting mr ravi to practise in a separate location at the high street office without any system of checking on him. indeed, mr cheng conceded in the 1 december 2021 reply letters and before the dt that he did not exercise any supervision over mr ravi’s practice as a lawyer prior to the 17 november 2021 letter. as the dt report summarised at [98(a)], mr cheng “was happy to leave [mr ravi] to his own devices” and “knew nothing about what mr ravi was doing in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor”.45 the evidence before us disclosed only three instances in which mr cheng was involved in mr ravi’s legal practice. the first concerned mr cheng’s management of the payment of monies by mr ravi’s clients into kkcl’s office account. this was the only positive and proactive step taken by mr cheng to supervise mr ravi’s legal practice. the other two instances occurred during the 19 november 2021 meeting where mr cheng sought an explanation on mr ravi’s conduct stated in the 17 november 2021 letter and then sought to impose several terms on mr ravi’s continued legal practice. these were steps taken by mr cheng in an attempt to address the complaints made against mr ravi. however, they were reactive in nature when his obligations in the undertaking were meant to be proactive and preventive. in any event, these steps taken only after the alleged misconduct had occurred did not ameliorate the situation in any way as mr ravi gave mr cheng no explanation and rejected the conditions sought to be imposed. mr cheng made no further attempts to involve himself in a supervisory capacity in the legal matters that mr ravi undertook.46 we therefore agreed with the dt that mr cheng’s conduct fell woefully short of what was expected of him under paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking. besides the payment of mr ravi’s clients’ monies into the kkcl office account, there was simply no attempt by mr cheng to supervise mr ravi’s legal practice in any way. it was clear therefore that mr cheng had breached paragraph 2(a) of the undertaking and, as the quoted authorities show, a breach of a solicitor’s undertaking would amount invariably to grossly improper conduct within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the lpa. we also accepted that mr cheng’s conduct would constitute misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the lpa. accordingly, due cause was established with respect to the first charge and its alternative and mr cheng was wise in his decision to “plead guilty” to the two charges before us.47 the third charge and its alternative alleged that mr cheng had breached paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking by failing to provide a monthly written report to the law society and the agc for the month of november 2021 by the stipulated deadline of 1 december 2021. this was not denied by mr cheng who only argued that the november 2021 report was not necessary in the light of the 17 november 2021 letter as all the relevant parties had been made aware of the issues relating to mr ravi’s alleged misconduct. 48 we agreed with the dt’s reasoning that mr cheng’s obligation under paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking was a strict one. the absence of any qualifier meant that mr cheng was required to file a monthly report by the stipulated deadline, regardless of the circumstances. if mr cheng had opined that the said report was not necessary in the circumstances that had taken place, he ought at least to have sought such confirmation from the relevant parties instead of making the determination unilaterally that there was no need for the report. 49 mr cheng’s failure to provide the monthly report to the law society and the agc by the stipulated deadline therefore amounted to a breach of paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking. we were therefore satisfied that due cause was established in relation to the third charge as mr cheng’s breach of paragraph 2(b) of the undertaking amounted to grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the lpa or, alternatively, misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the lpa.the appropriate sanctionthe applicable principles on the imposition of sanctions50 section 83(1) of the lpa sets out the sanctions that the court may impose when due cause is shown. it provides:power to strike off roll, etc.83.—(1)  all advocates and solicitors are subject to the control of the supreme court and shall be liable on due cause shown —(a) to be struck off the roll;(b) to be suspended from practice for a period not exceeding 5 years;(c) to pay a penalty of not more than $100,000;(d) to be censured; or(e) to suffer the punishment referred to in paragraph (c) in addition to the punishment referred to in paragraph (b) or (d).51 when considering the appropriate sanction to impose in cases not involving dishonesty or deceit, the starting point should ordinarily be a monetary penalty: law society of singapore v tay choon leng john [2012] 3 slr 150 at [59]. the existence of aggravating circumstances may then justify a departure from the aforesaid starting point and more serious sanctions such as suspension from practice or, in extreme cases, striking the advocate and solicitor off the roll may be justified: law society of singapore v chiong chin may selena [2013] sghc 5 at [45]. a fine would also not be appropriate where the legal practitioner’s misconduct was not mere inadvertence: see law society of singapore v tan see leh jonathan [2020] 5 slr 418 at [13].a six-months suspension is appropriate 52 with these principles in mind, we decided that a global suspension from practice for six months was warranted for the first and third charges. equally, we did not think that a fine would be commensurate with the breach of the undertaking on the facts of this case.53 it is important to note why the undertaking was necessary in this case.  mr ravi had a psychiatric condition. as can be seen from the conditions imposed on mr ravi, he was required to obtain and comply with medical treatment prescribed by a psychiatrist, to attend regular consultations with the psychiatrist for mental state reviews, to undergo prescribed medical tests, treatments and assessments in order to determine whether he continued to be medically fit to practise as an advocate and solicitor. mr ravi also had to consume medication prescribed to him by the psychiatrist. his condition was serious enough that a supervising solicitor and a monitoring solicitor were required to ensure his compliance with the conditions. as counsel for mr cheng, mr ong ying ping (“mr ong”) acknowledged, the preventive and protective measures in the conditions were essentially to ensure that mr ravi would be practising in a controlled environment.54 we accepted that mr cheng’s obligation of personal supervision did not entail that he vet every court document or legal correspondence in mr ravi’s practice. we also accepted that mr cheng could not be reasonably expected to monitor every telephone call made by mr ravi. we also did not think the undertaking required mr cheng to accompany mr ravi to every court hearing and every meeting with his clients outside the office. such obligations would be unduly onerous on the supervising solicitor as they would effectively make him a full-time guardian to mr ravi in his legal practice. 55 however, mr cheng should apprise himself at least as to what legal work mr ravi had taken on and whether he was coping well generally. personal supervision would be completely meaningless if the supervisor did not bother to know what legal work the supervisee was undertaking and how he was coping generally. in particular here, mr cheng had no awareness whatsoever of the legal cases that mr ravi had taken on or what documents he was dealing with. he was also unaware whether mr ravi had been appearing in court and whether there were any events of concern.  as an example, paragraph 8 of the conditions requires the supervising solicitor to notify the law society and the agc if he becomes aware of any circumstances that may impair the fitness of mr ravi to practise as an advocate and solicitor or which may impair his professional judgment, including the refusal by the supervisee to consume prescribed medication. this cannot mean that the supervising solicitor can leave the supervisee to do as he pleases and only needs to intervene when he hears of trouble. personal supervision must surely entail proactive steps on the part of the supervisor so that he is able to ensure that the supervisee is practising in a controlled environment. 56 mr cheng argued that mr ravi was a very senior lawyer and therefore should be able to handle his legal practice on his own. this implied that mr ravi needed no supervision at all in his legal practice. this begged the question why the conditions had to be imposed on mr ravi and why mr cheng had to undertake the obligations of being his supervising solicitor. this complete failure to appreciate the seriousness of the undertaking would also explain why mr cheng thought it fit, despite having undertaken to “personally supervise” mr ravi, “to leave him to his own devices” as stated in the dt report at [98(a)].57 on the issue whether mr ravi should be allowed to practise in a different location from mr cheng, our view is that, ideally, the supervisor and the supervisee should be located in the same office so as to facilitate communication and physical supervision. we accepted, however, that such an arrangement may not always be possible, bearing in mind practical constraints such as the available office space and particularly during the covid-19 pandemic at the material time in 2021 when safe distancing might be advisable. these points did not appear to have been raised by mr cheng before the dt anyway. however, in a situation where the supervisor and his supervisee are not in the same location, it becomes all the more important that an arrangement be put in place so that the supervisor is able to check in on the supervisee at regular intervals. as was apparent on the facts here, mr cheng did not seem to have even thought about such measures although the supervisee was not even within his sight in the office. 58 on the evidence, despite mr cheng’s awareness of the conditions and of his undertaking as a supervising solicitor, mr cheng seemed to be concerned only with paragraphs 2(a) and (b) of the conditions regarding the handling of mr ravi’s clients’ monies and with paragraph 3 on his duty to provide monthly reports to the law society and the agc. as mr ravi’s supervising solicitor, mr cheng appeared oblivious to or indifferent to his obligation under paragraph 2(d) of the undertaking to “take all necessary steps to ensure that [mr ravi] complies with all the conditions imposed on the practising certificate”. 59 at the hearing before us, mr ong submitted that mr cheng’s submission of the monthly reports demonstrated an attempt on mr cheng’s part to supervise mr ravi’s legal practice. mr ong also argued that mr cheng’s approach in supervising mr ravi was due to his misunderstanding as to the precise scope of his obligations in the undertaking. according to mr ong, had mr cheng known that his obligation to supervise entailed vetting every piece of legal work and correspondence produced by mr ravi, he would have rejected taking on this onerous undertaking. mr ong highlighted the remedial steps taken by mr cheng upon receiving the 17 november 2021 letter. these included having the 19 november meeting to bring the complaints to mr ravi’s attention and laying down certain conditions to govern their supervisor-supervisee relationship moving forward. mr cheng also took steps to terminate mr ravi’s e-litigation account on 31 january 2022 and agreed to pay all outstanding filing fees incurred by mr ravi. 60 as an advocate and solicitor of 24 years’ standing and experience at the material time, the onus was on mr cheng to clarify any doubts that he had as to the scope of the undertaking. we have already stated at [54] above that mr cheng was not expected to be a full-time guardian to his supervisee in his legal practice. we have also stated at [58] above that besides handling mr ravi’s clients’ monies and furnishing the monthly report, mr cheng did no supervision at all, as found by the dt.  61 there was little force in mr cheng’s point that he tried to impose some conditions on mr ravi’s legal practice during the 19 november 2021 meeting because mr ravi rejected those conditions anyway and also gave him no explanation as to the alleged misconduct raised in agc’s letters. it baffled us that, despite the supervisee’s attitude, mr cheng decided to continue as supervising solicitor until the expiry of mr ravi’s conditional practice certificate, which was more than four months away. 62 when asked about this, mr ong responded that mr cheng had already informed the law society and the agc and they could direct mr ravi to stop his legal practice. the point was that mr cheng could have warned mr ravi that he would not continue as the supervising solicitor if mr ravi remained intransigent in refusing the proposed conditions despite the complaints of alleged misconduct. this issue was raised in the 3 december 2021 letter by the agc which asked mr cheng to please “confirm our understanding that you are seeking to withdraw your consent forthwith to act as mr ravi’s supervising solicitor and consequently a release from your obligations” under the undertaking (see [22] above). mr cheng’s reply on 16 december 2021 was that his intention was to cease acting as the supervising solicitor when the current practice year ended in 2022 “so as to avoid disruption to [mr ravi’s] practice”. this did not seem to us to be what a responsible senior advocate and solicitor ought to have done in the circumstances that prevailed then.63  we also did not accept mr ong’s submission that mr cheng had adopted a “[sincere] and earnest attitude” in discharging his obligations under the undertaking. it was apparent that mr cheng did not think it necessary to take any steps to supervise mr ravi because no incident or complaint was brought to his attention from april 2021 to september 2021. mr cheng was expected to take proactive steps to ensure that mr ravi could practise in a controlled environment so as to prevent untoward incidents from happening. he was there to help prevent fires but, unfortunately, saw his role as merely reporting fires when they occur.64 mr ong also pointed out that mr cheng’s conduct should not be characterised as a deliberate breach of the undertaking and that mr cheng’s decision to act as mr ravi’s supervising solicitor was made out of his altruistic intention to help a fellow lawyer. while we appreciated mr cheng’s good intentions and accepted that he had no financial benefit in volunteering to be the supervising solicitor, he must accept that he had given a solemn undertaking as an advocate and solicitor to the supreme court and to the law society after declaring his awareness of the tasks entailed by the undertaking. he could not then proceed with his supervisory role with an indifferent or nonchalant attitude of “business as usual, nothing has changed”. conclusion65 having considered the precedents relating to breach of undertakings by advocates and solicitors, we determined that a suspension of six months was the appropriate sanction to impose on mr cheng for both the first and third charges. in our opinion, a fine would not underscore the seriousness of breaching such an undertaking given to the supreme court and to the law society. at mr cheng’s request, we ordered the suspension to take effect from 1 january 2024 so that he could complete his outstanding legal matters. we also ordered mr cheng to pay costs of $12,000 inclusive of disbursements to the law society for the proceedings before the dt and before this court.  tay yong
