and(b) the valuation of kiri’s shareholding in dystar taking into account the notional licence fee, and after adjusting for the fact that discount for lack of marketability is not a relevant adjustment as found by the court of appeal (kiri v senda (valuation) (ca) at [245]).the final valuation of kiri’s shares in dystar5 on 27 february 2023, pursuant to our directions, kiri’s valuation expert, ms harfouche, revised her calculations and arrived at the following figures (which were provided to senda together with ms harfouche’s updated model, and senda did not have any comments on these):(a) us$25.77m for the notional licence fee based on 53,550 tonnes for the related products; and(b) us$603.8m for the valuation of kiri’s shareholding in dystar based on the notional licence fee (without any discount for lack of marketability).these were taken to be the parties’ agreed calculations. thus, based on the above, we adjudge the final valuation of kiri’s shares to be us$603.8m for the buy-out order.6 we invite the parties’ positions on costs and any consequential directions that they may wish to seek. the parties are to take note of the court of appeal’s decision in senda international capital ltd v kiri industries ltd [2022] sgca(i) 10 regarding the principles for the assessment of costs for sicc proceedings in this regard.kannan ramesh judge of the appellate divisionroger gilesinternational judgeanselmo reyesinternational judgedinesh dhillon singh, lim dao kai, margaret joan ling wei wei and dhivya rajendra naidu (allen & gledhill llp) for the plaintiff;toh kian sing sc, cheng wai yuen mark, chew xiang, soh yu xian priscilla and lim wee teck darren (rajah & tann singapore llp) for the first defendant;see chern yang, audie wong cheng siew and teng po yew (drew & napier llc) for the second defendant.
