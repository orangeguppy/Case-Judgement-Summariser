  statement of claim (amendment no 4) (“soc (no 4)”), at para 1.



 in this judgment, i shall use the term “the plaintiffs” to refer to the representative plaintiffs and the 167 other members of the club collectively. 4 the club is owned by the first defendant, exklusiv resorts pte ltd (“exklusiv”). the second defendant, mr peter kwee seng chio (“peter kwee”) is a director and indirect shareholder of exklusiv. 5 the plaintiffs are unhappy with the relocation. they allege that exklusiv and peter kwee are liable for deceit, negligence and misrepresentation and that exklusiv is liable for breach of contract.6 the club is a proprietary club, which is different from a members’ club. in a members’ club, the club belongs to the members or a class of members collectively; the members (or class of members) decide on matters relating to the club. however, a proprietary club belongs to the proprietor and it is the proprietor who decides on matters relating to the club. the disputes in this case relate to the decisions by exklusiv (as the proprietor of the club) to redevelop 30sr, demolish the clubhouse at 30sr, amend the club’s rules to allow the relocation of the clubhouse, and relocate the clubhouse to laguna club’s premises.facts the origin of the club7 the club was a third attempt at operating a social club at 30sr. 30sr was home to the city country club, which was launched in 1981. in 1983, pinetree resort pte ltd (“pinetree resort”) bought 30sr together with the city country club, which was renamed as the pinetree town and country club (“pinetree club”). pinetree resort was placed under receivership in 2002 and 30sr (including the pinetree club) was put up for sale by tender. peter kwee was successful in his bid, which was made through group exklusiv pte ltd (“group exklusiv”). 8 group exklusiv was incorporated on 12 january 2000 and owned at all material times by peter kwee, his wife, his son and his daughter. group exklusiv wholly owns laguna golf resort holding pte ltd (“lgrh”), which was incorporated on 20 april 2001. lgrh manages the laguna club. 9 lgrh wholly owns exklusiv, which was incorporated on 29 july 2002. exklusiv became the owner of 30sr and proprietor of the club.10 peter kwee re-branded the pinetree club as the pines. in october 2002, exklusiv invited members of the pinetree club to join the club as individual founder members at a “special fee” of $9,900, or corporate founder members at a fee between $10,000 (for one nominee) and $50,000 (for six nominees). a member who was not a pinetree club member but was referred by an individual founder member paid a reduced membership fee of $12,000 (for individual membership) and between $15,000 and $80,000 (for corporate membership). individual memberships for the general public were launched subsequently at $18,000. 11 members of the club were also given access to the social facilities at the laguna club and an optional add-on access (for an additional subscription fee) to use the golf courses at the laguna club at discounted rates.

 the club operated at a loss12 peter kwee estimated that the club would require at least 4,000 members for its operations to break even. this estimate was based on the fact that the pinetree club had been making a small profit with a little over 4,000 members. peter kwee’s membership target for the club was 8,000 members.13 the membership drive for the club was not as successful as peter kwee had hoped for. as at 31 december 2002, the club’s membership stood at a little over 1,000 members. the club commenced operations on 1 january 2003.14 the club continued to carry out various membership drives. these membership drives managed to increase the club’s membership to only 1,490 members by 2012. since the club is a proprietary club, exklusiv is responsible for the costs of operating the club. as a result of the low membership, exklusiv suffered net losses operating the club from 2003 to 2012. peter kwee estimated the total net loss over the ten-year period at $61m. 15 in exklusiv’s audited accounts for the financial year (“fy”) 2012, exklusiv’s auditors opined that there was “significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”. exklusiv’s current liabilities then exceeded its current assets by approximately $36m. exklusiv was able to prepare its accounts on a going concern basis only because of peter kwee’s undertaking to provide continuing financial support.plans to redevelop 30sr16 according to peter kwee, he started discussions with various parties from around 2010 to explore possible solutions to the club’s loss-making position. one of these parties was oxley holdings ltd (“oxley holdings”).17 in june 2011, exklusiv engaged am architects pte ltd (“am architects”) to draw up plans for the redevelopment of 30sr for the purpose of seeking approval from the urban redevelopment authority (“ura”).

47 however, the scheduled opening of the laguna club and the dusit thani to the club’s members was delayed. peter kwee gave the following reasons for the delay:(a) the on-going development project for the mass rapid transit (“mrt”) line that was taking place just outside the premises of the laguna club involved digging underground. this meant that the piling works for the construction works could not take place concurrently.(b) tower cranes could not be used because the laguna club’s premises were within designated flight paths.(c) after the construction of the dusit thani was completed, it took some time for the temporary occupation permit (“top”) to be issued due to the covid-19 circuit breaker and phase 1 measures. the top was issued on 29 july 2020.48 on 15 october 2020, exklusiv informed the club’s members that, among other things:

58 many things were said at the dialogue session, in the q&as and in the letters referred to above. the plaintiffs did not particularise the specific representations that they were relying on in their statement of claim. however, the representations that form the basis of the claim for deceit can only be the representations that the plaintiffs have pleaded to be false since falsity is a necessary element. in this regard, the plaintiffs have pleaded that:

  soc (no 4), at paras 57(d)(1) and (4).



 (a) the “confirmed redevelopment was implausible in the light of the option and the sale”; and(b) it was false for the defendants to represent that the confirmed redevelopment would be taking place. 59 therefore, based on the plaintiffs’ pleaded case, the misrepresentations underlying their claim for deceit are the alleged misrepresentations relating to the confirmed redevelopment. 60 as the court of appeal pointed out in de la sala (at [172]), a representation as to the future is not, in itself, an actionable misrepresentation unless (a) it is an implied representation as to an existing fact, or (b) it implicitly represents the existence of an intention at the time of making the statement. 61 in the present case, the representations relating to the confirmed redevelopment in the letters referred to in [57] above were clearly representations as to the future, except for the representations in the 27 october 2017 letter relating to the redevelopment of the clubhouse at 30sr. the 27 october 2017 letter stated that there was a plan in 2013 for the new clubhouse to be at 30sr, that the project was challenging due to a myriad of factors, including financial viability, and that parties were unable to come to an agreement on the terms and conditions for the lease of the clubhouse.

 the representations in the 27 october letter were representations of existing facts but still related to the same question, ie, whether the defendants had in fact intended to provide the club’s members with a new clubhouse at 30sr. 63 i find that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the defendants did not intend to provide the club’s members with a new clubhouse at 30sr. on the contrary, there is ample evidence that the defendants did so intend but were ultimately unable to do so for the reasons that they have given (see [38] above). 64 first, the redevelopment plans for 30sr had included a clubhouse from the very first set of plans submitted to ura in 2011. thereafter, although there were changes, the redevelopment plans continued to include a clubhouse. the various approvals given by ura also included approvals for a clubhouse.65 second, it is clear that the redevelopment of 30sr by oxley gem was to include a clubhouse and that the intention was for the clubhouse to be leased to exklusiv. in the option, oxley gem acknowledged that exklusiv had obtained the grant of provision permission dated 27 february 2013 for the proposed development of 30sr, which included a “4-storey clubhouse with basement”.

 the redevelopment plans submitted by dp architects (oxley gem’s architects) continued to include a clubhouse. in my view, it is highly unlikely that the defendants would have gone to the extent of obtaining the first right of refusal from oxley gem if they had no intention of operating the club at 30sr. it is also highly unlikely that oxley gem would have given exklusiv the first right of refusal, or continued to include a clubhouse in the plans submitted to ura, if there was no intention or understanding that the redevelopment of 30sr would include a clubhouse that would be leased to exklusiv. there is no evidence, and it has not been pleaded or alleged, that there was any conspiracy between the defendants and oxley gem. 66 the plaintiffs have pleaded that the first right of refusal was inserted into the option “as a red herring” and that there were “carefully choreographed moves” that amended the redevelopment plans to reduce the four-storey clubhouse to three storeys and subsequently to two storeys.

 however, the plaintiffs stopped short of alleging any conspiracy between oxley gem and exklusiv. in any event, the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the changes made to the clubhouse in the redevelopment plans were “choreographed”. 67 it is true that the option did not impose a binding obligation on oxley gem to build a clubhouse according to exklusiv’s requirements. this is, in my view, understandable as the redevelopment was subject to approval from the relevant authorities, in particular, ura. it is also clear from the statements made to the plaintiffs (including the q&as and the slides presented at the dialogue session) that the building plans were proposed plans that were subject to changes. in any event, the fact that exklusiv had only a first right of refusal does not lead to the conclusion that the defendants did not intend to provide the club’s members with a new clubhouse at 30sr. 68 third, there is no evidence that suggests that the reasons given by the defendants (as to why it was not feasible to operate the club at the new clubhouse) were false.69 fourth, the plaintiffs argued that the size of the proposed clubhouse (882.2 sq m) was not sufficient for the club’s 1,500 members.

 the plaintiffs submitted that, therefore, the clubhouse that was included in the plans submitted to ura was not intended for the club’s members. i note that the gfa of 882.2 sq m that was set aside for the clubhouse excluded the club’s all-day café and function hall (with kitchen); the gfa occupied by the café and function hall formed part of the gfa set aside for commercial use (see [29] above). in any event, i reject the plaintiffs’ submission. it is not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case. it is also irrelevant since the plaintiffs’ case is that the defendants did not intend to provide a new clubhouse at 30sr “regardless of the size” of the clubhouse.

 in any event, the plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence to show that the size of the proposed clubhouse would not have been sufficient for 1,500 members. peter kwee testified that the planned size was sufficient because (a) with respect to the business of operating a club, as a rule of thumb, only 30% of the membership would be active, (b) the experience had been that the club’s facilities were very underutilised, and (c) the new clubhouse would be more of a businessman’s social club rather than a family club.

 i reject this submission. it is again not the pleaded case. the statement of claim only pleads that the “confirmed redevelopment” was implausible and that the representation that it would take place was false. in any event, the evidence shows that the intention then was to build a new four-storey clubhouse; the submission that had been made to ura at that time did include a four-storey clubhouse.71 in light of my finding above, it is unnecessary for me to consider the remaining elements of deceit. the plaintiffs’ claim for deceit fails.whether exklusiv and/or peter kwee are liable for negligent misrepresentation? 72 the plaintiffs’ claim for negligent misrepresentation is based on the same allegations pleaded in respect of their claim for deceit.

 i have found that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the defendants did not intend to provide a new clubhouse at 30sr. it follows that the plaintiffs’ claim for negligent misrepresentation also fails. whether exklusiv and/or peter kwee are liable for negligence? 73 the plaintiffs’ case is that the defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty of care to provide timely, true and accurate information as regards the redevelopment of the clubhouse at 30sr and that the defendants breached this duty. in my judgment, the plaintiffs’ claim in negligence fails.74 first, the statement of claim ought to state the facts upon which the supposed duty is founded: singapore civil procedure 2020 vol 1 (chua lee ming editor-in-chief) (sweet & maxwell, 2020) (“singapore civil procedure”), at para 18/12/30. in this case, the plaintiffs have simply pleaded that the defendants owe a duty of care, without pleading the specific facts that are said to give rise to the alleged duty of care.

 however, the plaintiffs have not pleaded their case as such. 75 the plaintiffs relied on spandeck engineering (s) pte ltd v defence science & technology agency [2007] 4 slr(r) 100 (“spandeck”). in that case, the court of appeal held (at [77], [81], [83] and [115]) that the test to determine the imposition of a duty of care is a two-stage test comprising of, first, proximity and, second, policy considerations, which are preceded by the threshold question of factual foreseeability. the first stage of proximity required sufficient legal proximity between the claimant and defendant for a duty of care to arise. the focus is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, including physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance. if a positive answer to the threshold question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of proximity was assumed, a prima facie duty of care arose. policy considerations, such as the presence of a contractual matrix which clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and their relative bargaining positions, then arise and are applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this prima facie duty.76 it is clear that whether the factual foreseeability and proximity tests are met depend on the facts. it is incumbent upon the plaintiffs to properly plead the facts relied upon in this regard. the plaintiffs have plainly failed to do so.77 second, the statement of claim should allege the precise breach of that duty: singapore civil procedure at para 18/12/30. here, the plaintiffs plead that the defendants breached their duty of care by:

the 27 october 2017 letter and the amendments to rules 3c, 4 and 30a82 i shall deal with these together since they are connected. before they were amended, rules 3c and 4 provided that the club and clubhouse would be at 30sr. the amended rules 3c and 4 permit exklusiv to situate the club and clubhouse at such other location/s “as it deems fit in its sole discretion”. the amended rule 30a provides that exklusiv may extend the term of the memberships if the club’s facilities are suspended or unavailable for an extended period “whether due to relocation or refurbishment or other unforeseen circumstances”. the real issue relates to the amendments to rules 3c and 4. the amendments to rule 30a are consequential and, in any event, are still relevant (a) whether or not the club is relocated, and (b) where the club is relocated within the central area of singapore.83 the scope of the amended rules 3c and 4 is broad enough to permit the relocation. if the amendments are valid, then it must follow that the declaration in the 27 october 2017 letter (that the clubhouse will no longer be located at 30sr) cannot be a breach of the membership contract. 84 rule 66 expressly allows exklusiv to amend the rules subject only to giving at least 14 days’ prior notice to the club’s members. it is not surprising that there is such a rule since the club is a proprietor’s club. the question is whether there are any restrictions to exklusiv’s right to amend the rules. the plaintiffs say that this right is subject to the following implied terms of the membership contract (the “implied terms”):

(a) the nature and object of the club is that of a city club located in a central area of singapore.(b) rule 66 cannot be used by exklusiv to alter the central location of the clubhouse “to the eastern fringe of singapore at laguna club”.(c) exklusiv cannot act in bad faith or in an arbitrary, irrational or capricious manner when exercising its contractual discretion under rule 66 to amend the rules.(d) exklusiv owes a duty of loyalty and fidelity to the members and to act bona fide in the best interests of the members.the plaintiffs say that the amendments to rules 3c and 4 breach these implied terms. 85 two issues arise at this stage. the first is whether the implied terms asserted by the plaintiffs satisfy the tests set out in sembcorp marine ltd v ppl holdings pte ltd and another and another appeal [2013] 4 slr 193 (“sembcorp marine”). the second is whether the entire agreement clause in the membership contract precludes the implication of terms.whether the alleged implied terms satisfy the tests in sembcorp marine86 a term may be implied in a contract only if (a) there is a gap in the contract which the parties did not contemplate, (b) it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy, and (c) the specific term to be implied is one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract: sembcorp marine at [101].87 in my view, the first implied term in [84(a)] above satisfies the tests in sembcorp marine. (a) the parties clearly did not contemplate where the club might be relocated to. in fact, the parties did not even contemplate that the club might have to be relocated at all. this is clear from the fact the rules had to be amended to provide for the club to be situated at other locations. (b) this implied term is necessary to give the membership contract efficacy. i have no doubt that location was an important consideration in the decision whether to purchase a membership in the club. the club was situated at a prime location at 30sr when it was launched. the rules also stated unequivocally that the club would be situated at 30sr. the marketing brochure for the club described the club as a “town club … [n]estled within the unspoilt greenery of stevens road …” and emphasised its “exclusive location”.

 i accept that exklusiv should be permitted to relocate the club but there has to be limits to where it can relocate the club to. without this implied term, exklusiv would be free to amend the rules to allow it to relocate the club anywhere in singapore. even exklusiv did not argue for such a wide and unfettered right during closing submissions.

 89 the core central region extends well beyond the immediate vicinity of 30sr. it is not disputed that the laguna club and the dusit thani are not within the core central region of singapore.90 the second implied term in [84(b)] above is consequential upon the first. as there is an implied term that the club is to be a city club located in a central area of singapore, it follows that exklusiv cannot change the central location of the clubhouse to the eastern fringe of singapore at laguna club. the term to be implied is as follows – “rule 66 does not permit amendments to the rules to allow the club to be situated outside the central area of singapore”.91 as for the third implied term in [84(c)] above, it seems unarguable that it should be implied. exklusiv’s concession in closing submissions (that there are limits to its right to relocate the club) supports the implication of this term. in addition, the implication of such a term is also supported by authority.92 in tan chin seng and others v raffles town club pte ltd [2003] 3 slr(r) 307 (“raffles town club”), the court of appeal agreed with the trial judge in rejecting the argument that the relevant rules vested in the club complete discretion in all matters pertaining to the club. the court held that the discretionary power must be exercised in furtherance of its object (at [31]–[32]). 93 in mga international pte ltd v wajilam exports (singapore) pte ltd [2010] sghc 319, the high court held that there is a corresponding expectation that a contractual discretion would be exercised fairly and rationally (at [103]). the court referred (at [105]) to socimer bank ltd v standard bank ltd [2008] 1 lloyd’s rep 558 in which it was said that the concern is that the discretion is not abused and hence, the court will impose an implied term that the discretion should be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally. 94 as for the fourth implied term in [84(d)] above, i see no reason to imply the term that exklusiv owes a duty of loyalty and fidelity to the members and to act bona fide in the best interests of the members. in my view, it is not necessary to imply such a term in order to give the membership contract efficacy. neither is it a term that exklusiv would have simply responded “oh, of course!” to. such a term is inconsistent with the nature of the club as a proprietor’s club. as the proprietor, exklusiv bears all the costs of purchasing 30sr, maintaining the club’s facilities and operating the club. exklusiv has a contractual obligation to provide the club’s facilities for the members’ use but that does not carry with it the duties that the plaintiffs seek.whether the entire agreement clause precludes any implied terms95 exklusiv submitted that there is no scope for implied terms in the membership contract because the membership application forms contain the following entire agreement clause:

[exklusiv] makes no representations, warranties nor undertakings as to the memberships of the club and/or the club. all terms, conditions, obligations, promises, representations, warranties, undertakings or other statement not expressly stated herein (whether implied by law legislation or otherwise howsoever) are hereby expressly excluded.96 exklusiv relied on ng giap hon v westcomb securities pte ltd and others [2009] 3 slr(r) 518 (“ng giap hon”). in that case, the entire agreement clause stated as follows (at [29]):this agreement embodies, the entire understanding of the parties and there are no provision, terms, conditions or obligations, oral or written, expressed or implied, other than those contained herein. all obligations of the parties to each other under previous agreements ([if] any) are hereby released, but without prejudice to any rights which have already accrued to either party. [court of appeal’s emphasis in ng giap hon in italics]97 the court of appeal held that the entire agreement clause did not preclude the implication of terms into the agreement, noting that the clause itself contemplated the existence of implied terms in the agreement (at [30]). the court of appeal went on to state as follows (at [31]): however, we would also pause to observe that, even if there is no reference to implied terms in an entire agreement clause, it is arguable that the presence of such a clause in a contract would not, as a matter of general principle, exclude the implication of terms into that contract for several reasons. first, an implied term, by its very nature (as an implied term), would not, ex hypothesi, have been in the contemplation of the contracting parties to begin with when they entered into the contract. secondly, if a term were implied on, so to speak, a “broader” basis “in law” (as opposed to on a “narrower” basis “in fact”), it would follow, a fortiori, that such a term would not have been in the contemplation of the parties for, as we shall see below (at [38]), a term which is implied “in law” (unlike a term which is implied “in fact”) is not premised on the presumed intention of the contracting parties as such. thirdly, it is clearly established law that a term cannot be implied if it is inconsistent with an express term of the contract concerned. this principle is, of course, both logical as well as commonsensical. finally, as pointed out by nigel teare qc (sitting as a deputy judge of the english high court) in exxonmobil sales and supply corp v texaco ltd [2004] 1 all er (comm) 435 at [27]:it [is] … arguable that where it is necessary to imply a term in order to make the express terms work such an implied term may not be excluded by [an] entire agreement clause because it could be said that such a term is to be found in the document or documents forming part of the contract. [court of appeal’s emphasis in ng giap hon in italics]98 however, the court of appeal acknowledged that an entire agreement clause could exclude the implication of terms into a contract if it expressed such effect in “clear and unambiguous language” (at [32]).99 as stated earlier, exklusiv conceded during closing submissions that there are limits to its power to relocate the club. that must mean that there is at least some implied term in play that limits its discretionary power to amend the rules. exklusiv’s reliance on the entire agreement clause to preclude any implied terms is therefore inconsistent with its own concession. 100 in any event, in my view, the language in the entire agreement clause in this case is not sufficiently “clear and unambiguous” such as to preclude the implication of the first three terms asserted by the plaintiffs. if exklusiv’s argument about the entire agreement clause is correct, that would mean that it can amend the rules even to the extent of providing nothing more than, for example, a members’ lounge in a one-room “clubhouse” in the middle of an industrial estate in the west end of singapore. admittedly, this is an extreme example. but, as pointed out in raffles town club at [32], “it is often by resorting to extreme examples that one would be able to see whether an argument advanced is reasonable and logical”. exklusiv breached the implied terms101 in conclusion, i find that the following implied terms form part of the rules:(a) the nature and object of the club is that of a city club located in a central area of singapore. (b) rule 66 does not permit amendments to the rules to allow the club to be situated outside the central area of singapore.(c) exklusiv cannot act in bad faith or in an arbitrary, irrational or capricious manner when exercising its contractual discretion under rule 66 to amend the rules.102 in making the amendments to rules 3c and 4 and in declaring in the 27 october 2017 letter that the clubhouse will no longer be located at 30sr, exklusiv therefore breached the implied terms set out above. 103 the amendments to rule 30a are not in breach of the implied terms as they are still relevant (a) whether or not the club is relocated, and (b) where the club is relocated within the central area of singapore.section 3(2)(b) ucta104 section 3 of the ucta states as follows:3.––(1) this section applies as between contracting parties where one of them deals as a consumer or on the other’s written standard terms of business.(2) as against that party, the other cannot by reference to any contract term ––(a) …(b) claim to be entitled ––(i) to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him; or(ii) in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation to render no performance at all,except in so far as (in any of the cases mentioned in this subsection) the contract term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.105 exklusiv says that the relocation is permitted under the amended rules 3c and 4. under s 3(2) of the ucta, exklusiv cannot rely on the amended rules 3c and 4 unless they satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. in this regard, as exklusiv submitted, the question is whether the term in question is reasonable, not whether the discretion under the relevant term is exercised properly. 106 given my conclusions on the implied terms, in my judgment, the amended rules 3c and 4 would not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. exklusiv therefore cannot rely on the amended rules 3c and 4 to justify the relocation. what loss have the plaintiffs suffered as a result of exklusiv’s breaches of contract?107 in their statement of claim, the plaintiffs pleaded that they have each “lost around twenty (20) remaining years of club membership that they had purchased, to enjoy the clubhouse and the facilities at [30sr]”.

 they sought the following reliefs for exklusiv’s breaches of contract:(a) a declaration that the amendments of rules 3c, 4 and 30a are invalid.(b) an order for specific performance of the membership contracts and the “claimed redevelopment” whereby exklusiv procures one of the hotels from oxley gem and converts it into a clubhouse for the club, furnished and refurnished with the facilities as represented at the dialogue session.(c) alternatively, an order for exklusiv and/or peter kwee to procure for each of the plaintiffs’ membership in an equivalent city and country club such as the tanglin club or the american club located at a central area of singapore for a term not less than the remaining membership term that each plaintiff has.(d) alternatively, an order to compensate each plaintiff a value equivalent to the present market value of about 20 years’ use of 30sr plus clubhouse buildings and facilities divided by the average number of members to be determined.(e) damages to be assessed.(f) an account of profits made by exklusiv and/or peter kwee.(g) further or in the alternative, an account of profits or an inquiry as to damages and payment of all sums found to be due upon the taking of such account or inquiry. claims for relief against peter kwee108 at the outset, i note that peter kwee is not a party to the membership contracts and there is no claim against him for breach of contract. the plaintiffs’ claims for relief of any sort against peter kwee for breach of contract are therefore misconceived and cannot succeed.claim for declaration109 in view of my conclusions that the amendments to rules 3c and 4 are in breach of the implied terms, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the amendments to rule 3c and 4 are invalid. however, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a similar declaration in respect of the amendments to rule 30a as those amendments are not in breach of the implied terms. claim for exklusiv to provide the clubhouse at 30sr 110 in my view, the plaintiffs are not entitled to an order that exklusiv procures one of the hotels from oxley gem and converts it into a clubhouse for the club. the plaintiffs own case does not even require that the club has to be situated at 30sr, only that it should be situated within the central area of singapore. 111 in any event, specific performance is a discretionary remedy and is generally available only when an award of damages is an inadequate remedy or when it will do more perfect and complete justice than an award of damages: halsbury’s laws of singapore vol 7 (lexisnexis, 2019) at para 80.586. it is clear beyond any doubt that there is no reason to grant specific performance instead of damages in this case. there is nothing so unique about membership in a social club that damages cannot be an adequate remedy.112 the membership contract imposes an obligation on exklusiv (as the proprietor) to provide certain facilities (including a clubhouse) for the plaintiffs’ use. as members of the club, the plaintiffs have a contractual licence to use those facilities, subject to the terms of the membership contract (including the payment of monthly subscription fees). the plaintiffs are also free to sell their memberships, again, subject to the terms of the membership contract. that is the extent of the plaintiffs’ rights as members of the club. the membership contract does not give the plaintiffs any additional interest in 30sr or the club’s facilities.113 damages for breach of contract are to compensate the claimant for the loss or damage suffered by him on account of the breach, so as to place him in the same situation as if the contract had been performed: raffles town club pte ltd v tan chin seng and others [2005] 4 slr(r) 351 (“raffles town club (no 2)”) at [16]. in that case, damages for the club-owner’s breach of contract in failing to deliver a premier club were assessed based on the diminution in value of membership in the club as a result of the breach. 114 if exklusiv did not breach the membership contract, the club would have simply remained as it was, situated at 30sr. exklusiv has no obligation to build a new clubhouse. however, as a result of the relocation, the club is now located on the laguna club’s premises. there is no evidence that the facilities that the plaintiffs have access to at the club at laguna are lacking in any manner. the plaintiffs’ complaint is simply that the club is no longer in the central area of singapore. the plaintiffs’ memberships in the club today have a market value, just as they had a market value when the club was situated at 30sr. there is no reason why, as a matter of principle, damages (based on any loss in the value of the memberships as a result of the relocation) would not be adequate. further, specific performance in this case would be grossly disproportionate to the damages that the plaintiffs can recover. granting specific performance in this case would result in injustice.alternative claim for replacement club memberships115 in my view, the plaintiffs are also not entitled to an order that exklusiv procures a membership in a social club in the central area of singapore, such as the tanglin club or the american club, for each of the plaintiffs. i can see no reason why such an order (assuming that it is even possible to purchase 1,500 memberships in these clubs) would be appropriate. such an order is akin to specific performance. the plaintiffs’ remedy clearly lies in damages.116 in any event, neither the tanglin club nor the american club are truly comparable clubs in this regard. (a) tanglin club memberships are non-transferable. the club does not sell new memberships but purchases existing memberships and resells them; there is a long waiting list of over ten years.

claim for a share of the present market value of about 20 years’ use of 30sr plus clubhouse buildings and facilities118 the plaintiffs have not shown any basis for this claim. as stated earlier, the plaintiffs’ own case does not even require the club to be situated at 30sr. even on the basis of the plaintiffs’ case that the club is to be situated in the central area of singapore, there is still no basis for this remedy. 119  the value of the right to access and use the club’s facilities is reflected in the market value of the memberships. anyone who wishes to obtain these rights does so by buying a membership at the prevailing market price. the plaintiffs now have the use of the clubhouse and facilities of the laguna club and the dusit thani. their remedy lies in damages based on any loss in the value of their memberships in the club at laguna compared to the club at 30sr.120 i note as well that in raffles town club (no 2), the court of appeal computed damages for the club-owner’s breach of contract based on the diminution in the value of the club’s membership.damages to be assessed121 damages in the present case are to be assessed based on any diminution in the value of the membership in the club, by comparing the value of the membership today as compared to its value when the club was at 30sr.exklusiv’s experts’ evidence122 in her report, exklusiv’s expert, ms yak chau wei (“yak”) concluded that there has not been any diminution in the value of membership in the club that is attributable to the relocation; on the contrary, the value has increased.

(a) the last recorded transacted priced for the laguna social membership was in july 2011 at $3,500; the average transacted price was $3,300. (b) the full laguna golf membership had increased by 2.5 times since 2010. while the golf courses remained largely the same, members will be able to enjoy the new facilities at laguna club and the dusit thani. the price of social memberships will possibly enjoy a similar increase.(c) applying the multiplier of 2.5 to $3,300 gives the figure of $8,250. 130 yak thus concluded that the value of the plaintiffs’ memberships in the club at laguna is worth more than if the club had remained at 30sr. in fact, the plaintiffs stand to gain even more. exklusiv has agreed to waive the transfer fee for two years after the club resumes operations at laguna (see [48(b)] above). this means that if any of the plaintiffs were to sell their memberships within the two-year period, they would receive an additional $4,280, being the transfer fee that they would otherwise have had to pay if they had sold their memberships at any other time.131 exklusiv’s other expert was ms choo peck ling (“choo”), the founding partner of active golf services pte ltd (“active golf”), which specialises in providing brokering services for the sale and purchase of club memberships in singapore, malaysia and indonesia and has been doing so for more than 20 years. govinda agreed that active golf is established in its business.

 govinda’s assessment of damages for loss of use from 2013 to 2020, the value of yielding vacant possession and loss of opportunity in [133(a)], [133(b)] and [133(d)] above are not relevant to the plaintiffs’ pleaded loss. these heads of damages are also not losses suffered as a result of the breaches of contract, ie, the declaration in the 27 october 2017 letter that the clubhouse will no longer be located at 30sr and the amendments to rules 3c and 4 (see [102] above).136 it is also not disputed that the plaintiffs agreed to the suspension of the club’s operations at 30sr during the redevelopment of 30sr (the “suspension agreement”). during this period, the plaintiffs were given temporary social memberships at the laguna club (see [31(e)] above). the plaintiffs’ pleaded case does not seek to set aside the suspension agreement. neither does their pleaded case include a claim for breach of the suspension agreement, or misrepresentation in respect of the suspension agreement. the plaintiffs have also not shown how the suspension agreement was breached. 137 in addition, i have the following observations regarding govinda’s evidence:(a) govinda considered that only the american club and tanglin club can be considered to have locations “similar” to the club at 30sr and that the legends is in a “different location”.

 i cannot see why the legends’ location should be considered to be different for this reason. the legends is just “about 10 minutes away”

 in any event, the legends is situated within the core central region of singapore.(c) govinda eschewed relying on transacted prices as the best indicator of the fair value of club memberships. i agree with yak that this is baffling.

  yak’s reply report dated 5 october 2020, exhibited as ycw-2 in yak’s supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief affirmed on 6 october 2020 (“yak’s reply report”), at p 5 (para 19a).



 govinda used the original membership fee of $9,900 paid by individual founder members (in december 2002/early 2003) to assess the value of the membership in 2013 (when the club ceased operations at 30sr) and 2020 by applying a price trend based on the membership prices of just two clubs – the american club and the singapore cricket club.

 according to active golf, the average transacted price for the club’s membership in 2011 was $6,950 and in 2012, it was $5,933; there were no transactions in 2013.

 govinda simply ignored all these transacted prices and assessed the value of the club’s membership in 2013 at $24,750.

 based on the evidence before me, this can only be described as an unrealistic value.(d) i also agree with yak that govinda’s choice of the american club and singapore cricket club, as comparable clubs for the extrapolation of the club’s membership price, is not representative of the broad market movements.

 first, the american club is not a comparable club (see [116(b)] above). second, using the phenomenal increase in membership prices for the american club between 2003 and 2013/2020 clearly skews the price trend. third, govinda’s decision to use only two clubs for comparison increases the impact of the increase in membership prices for the american club. in my view, the inclusion of the american club and the decision to use only two clubs for comparison cannot be supported.(e) in his first report, govinda proceeded on the basis that the transacted prices of club memberships exclude the transfer fees, which according to him, “must be borne by the new member”.

 choo’s evidence was that the transfer fee is factored into the price and is borne by the seller, which is the general industry practice.

 in my view, this fundamental error raises doubts as to the extent of govinda’s expertise concerning prices of club memberships. i note also that in his second report, govinda did not correct his mistake although he was replying to yak’s and choo’s expert reports and so would have seen choo’s evidence. in my view, this does not reflect well on his credibility. conclusion on damages138 i accept yak’s and choo’s evidence that the american club and tanglin club are not comparable clubs for present purposes. i accept yak’s evidence that there is no diminution in the value of the plaintiffs’ memberships in the club at 30sr as at october 2017 compared to the value of their memberships in the club at laguna. i find that yak’s approach is reasonable and logical. further, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence for such diminution in value of the plaintiffs’ memberships.139 in the circumstances, i find that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that they have suffered loss and i award each plaintiff nominal damages of $1,500 each.account of profits/inquiry as to damages140 during closing submissions, the plaintiffs confirmed that they are no longer pursuing an account of profits.

 in any event, there is no basis for this remedy.141 the plaintiffs have also accepted that the alternative prayer for an inquiry as to damages is not relevant as the assessment of damages was dealt with during the trial.

plaintiffs’ application to introduce new evidence142 after the defendants had closed their case, the plaintiffs sought to introduce into evidence documents from ura to show the gfa of the clubhouse at 30sr in 1994 and 1995 when it was the pinetree club. the plaintiffs submitted that these documents were relevant to clarify the size of the clubhouse, which peter kwee had said was 2,746 sq m.143 i dismissed the plaintiffs’ application. the application was being made at a late stage of the proceedings when clearly, the plaintiffs could have obtained these documents earlier. more importantly, in my view, the documents were not relevant to the issues before me. 144 the size of the clubhouse in 1994/1995 had no bearing on whether the defendants genuinely intended to provide a new clubhouse at 30sr as part of the redevelopment of the property. neither did it have any bearing on whether the relocation breached the membership contracts.145 the plaintiffs also submitted that the documents would show that the proposed new clubhouse at 30sr was far too small. in my view, this was irrelevant.  the thrust of the plaintiffs’ submission was that the clubhouse that was included in the plans submitted to ura was not intended for the club’s members. as stated in [69] above, this is not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case. further, the size of the clubhouse in 1994/1995 could accommodate a far larger membership than what the club had. peter kwee had targeted a membership size of 8,000 members when he launched the club (see [12] above). peter kwee testified that the size of the proposed new clubhouse was sufficient for the club’s 1,500 members. the plaintiffs had not adduced any evidence to the contrary.  conclusion146  for the reasons stated above, i dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims against exklusiv and peter kwee for deceit, negligent misrepresentation and negligence. exklusiv is liable to the plaintiffs for breach of contract but the plaintiffs have failed to prove that they have suffered loss. accordingly, i award each of the plaintiffs nominal damages in the sum of $1,500.147 i will hear parties on costs.chua lee mingjudge of the high courtlau kah hee and fikri yeong (bc lim & lau llc) for the plaintiffs;vikram nair and foo xian fong (rajah & tann singapore llp) for the defendants.annex a
