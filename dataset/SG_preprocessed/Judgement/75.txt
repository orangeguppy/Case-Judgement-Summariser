 hence the computer allocated title of this judgment. the learned deputy registrar reserved to the judge hearing the application the respondent’s prayer for an order that the “[p]arties’ identities on the case file be anonymised and any written judgments, orders, and/or grounds in the proceedings be duly amended so as not to reveal the identity of the parties to the proceedings”.

3 the first part of that prayer has in practice been accommodated by the sealing of the court file and the allocated title. the applicants did not oppose the second part of the prayer. the arbitral proceedings were subject to confidentiality, and on the materials before me no reason appears why the derivative interest in protecting their confidentiality (see the republic of india v deutsche telecom ag [2023] sgca(i) 4 at [23]) should not be recognised as an exception to the general principle of open justice. however, i am doubtful about an order effectively directed to myself, and an order is unnecessary. avoiding the confusion of consonants in the names in the allocated title, i will refer to the first applicant, a company, as “aco” and to the second applicant, a natural person, as “a” (and to them together as the “applicants”), and to the respondent, a company, as “rco”; and i will frame this judgment and any orders so as not to reveal the parties’ identities (including gender neutrality as to a). 4 the relief claimed in the application was in the form that the applicants applied to set aside the awards in both arbitrations; that is, that aco applied to set aside the award against a (the “a award”) as well as the award against itself (the “aco award”), and vice versa.

 this was incorrect. the wrapped-up approach was carried through to the hearing of the application, albeit not entirely inappropriately when the grounds for setting aside and the submissions were generally directed to setting aside both awards without distinction according to the applicant and the award, although there were occasions when distinction was necessary. rco noted the incorrect form of the application as “irregular”,

 the application was opposed through an affidavit of the ceo (and also a director) of rco. all affidavits went beyond evidence to include a deal of argumentative material.7 while the relevant sub-articles of art 34(2) of the model law and the sub-sections of s 24 of the iaa underlying the grounds for setting aside can be inferred from the applicants’ affidavits (in which ground (a) included that there was no valid arbitration agreement between a and rco), they were not explicitly stated in the application or the affidavits. by o 48 r 2(4)(a) of the rules of court 2021 (the “rules”), the affidavit in support of an application to set aside an award must “state the grounds in support of the application”. referring to bzw and another v bzv [2022] 1 slr 1080 (“bzw”) at [48], where in relation to the predecessor o 69a r 2(4a) of the rules of court (2014 rev ed) the court of appeal said that the rule would be satisfied by a brief statement of the sub-articles of art 34(2) of the model law and s 24 of the iaa which were relied on to justify the setting aside application, rco submitted that the application was again “irregular”.

4. pursuant to articles 38(1) and 38(2) of the arbitration rules of the united nations commission on international trade law (with new article 1, paragraph 4, as adopted in 2013) (“2013 uncitral arbitration rules”), the tribunal may correct certain errors in an award, including errors “in computation, any clerical or typographical error or any error or omission of a similar nature,” and, “within 30 days after the communication of the award,” it may do so “on its own initiative”. further, under article 38(3) of the 2013 uncitral arbitration rules, any such correction “shall form part of the award”.5. the tribunal hereby finds that the miscalculation of the applicable gst in the 18 february 2023 final award was an error of computation within the meaning of article 38 of the 2013 uncitral arbitration rules, and thus a correction of the final award on the tribunal‘s own initiative is permitted and appropriate in this case.6. accordingly, the final award is hereby corrected as follows:a. the table included at paragraph 102 of the award is hereby replaced by the following table:…7. all other portions of the final award remain unchanged.28 the corresponding paragraphs in the correction to the a award were similar, save that the reference to the power to correct errors was to r 33.2 of the siac rules, and it was said that by r 33.1 of those rules, any correction “shall constitute part of the award”.

 29 in each new table, there were new figures for the three components of siac’s fees and expenses, but they added up to the same subtotal for siac’s fees and expenses as in the corresponding original table. in consequence, the figures for the total costs of the arbitration of $122,868.14 or $123,282.14 remained the same, and the amounts awarded for rco’s costs remained the same. the oddity is that siac’s administration fee, expenses, and gst all changed, but the sub-totals for siac’s fees and expenses and hence the total costs of arbitration remained the same; further, the new figures do not seem to reflect a recalculation with a different gst rate. counsel could not explain this, or how the application of the gst rate of 8% rather than 7% was found in the figures.

45 there is superficial attraction in the proposition that when the arbitral tribunal corrects an error in an award, the award as corrected becomes the award and so receipt of the award means receipt of the corrected award. the award as corrected is thenceforward the award. but that does not mean that “the award” in art 34(3) is the award as corrected, or that the date of receipt of the award in art 34(3) is the date of receipt of the corrected award. 46 this result is not mandated by any definition of an award: the model law does not have a definition, and the definition in s 2(1) of the iaa refers simply to “a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the dispute”. nor, contrary to the applicants’ submissions, is it mandated by the tribunal’s references in the corrections to the corrections forming part of the awards. they do, but the statements to that effect to which the tribunal referred, found also in the closing words of art 33(1) in relation to an interpretation of an award, serve a different purpose and do not make the award as corrected the award for all purposes. 47 an arbitral tribunal’s authority generally expires on the issue of a final award, when it becomes functus officio: see akn and another v alc and others and another appeal [2016] 1 slr 966 at [44]–[49]. in david caron and lee caplan, the uncitral arbitration rules: a commentary (oxford university press, 2nd ed, 2013), it is said in the commentary to art 38 that the purpose is to “extend the arbitral tribunal’s authority beyond the date of the award”, and that “the ultimate status of a correction to an award will depend on the terms of the applicable national arbitration law”. this reflects the report of working group ii (arbitration and conciliation) on the work of its fifty-first session (vienna, 14–18 september 2009) (uncitral, 2009) at para 111, in its consideration of art 36, which became art 38, where it was said in response to the suggestion that stating that a correction would form part of the award would create difficulties “in particular with deadlines for recourse, depending on what the date of the corrected award was determined to be”, that the national arbitration law would govern the matter. in chong et al, a guide to the siac arbitration rules (oxford university press, 2nd ed, 2013) at paras 14.55–14.56, the commentary on r 33 also treats the statement as providing an exception to the principle that the arbitral tribunal is functus officio after entering an award. that is, the statements that a correction forms part of the award give or confirm the arbitral tribunal’s authority, and do not further prescribe the effect of the correction. 48 the effect of the correction must be determined from the model law as part of singapore law, as repeated in o 48 r 2(3). the statement that a correction pursuant to either art 33(1)(a) or art 33(2) forms part of the award is not found in art 33 of the model law, which conspicuously says that only as to an interpretation of the award. 49 what is meant by “the award” in art 34(3), and the answer to the question, is a matter of construction of the article, together with art 33, in its place in the model law. it was submitted on behalf of rco that art 34(3) provides for postponement of the commencement of the three-month period only in the case of a request for correction, so that without more, there was no postponement in the case of a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative.

[art 34(3)] only refers to a ‘request made under article 33’; as such, it does not seem to encompass the hypothesis of a correction made by the tribunal ex officio, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the same article. in any case, the possibility of corrections made by the tribunal on its own motion only exists for thirty days from the date of the award, and is limited to the rectification of computational, clerical, or typographical errors. for this reason, it is in practice unlikely that the existence of a potential ground for annulment may become apparent to the losing party only after the correction has been made.50 ms chong referred also to daewoo shipbuilding & marine engineering co ltd v songa offshore equinox ltd and another [2019] 1 all er 161 (“daewoo”),

 where it was held that under the arbitration act 1996 (c 23) (uk), the time for challenging an award was not automatically delayed by an application for correction, specifically in regard to the rejection by bryan j of the submission that the date of the award when there was any correction was the date of the correction (at [56]–[62]). his lordship said (at [56]): it is contrary to the whole ethos of the act, and would frustrate the object and purpose of the short time limit in s 70(3). on their proper interpretation, ss 54 and 57 do not justify the conclusion that where there has been any correction the date of the correction is to be treated as the date of the award. given the importance of speed and finality in the context of arbitration, it would have been most surprising if the statutory intention, embodied in those sections, was that any correction – no matter how trivial or irrelevant – had the effect of postponing the strict time limit set out in s 70(3).51 other than for its highlighting the importance of speed and finality in arbitration, daewoo is of little assistance to rco. the context was an application to correct an award, not a correction made by an arbitral tribunal on its own initiative (at [9]). it was held that it was necessary that the correction be material, meaning that it was necessary to enable the party to know whether he had grounds to challenge the award (at [61] –[62]), and so it was recognised that where there was an application for a material correction, the date of the correction did become the date from which the time for challenging the award ran (at [60] and [62]). in xstrata coal queensland pty ltd and others v benxi iron & steel (group) international economic & trading co ltd [2020] bus lr 954 at [30]–[32], as cited by the applicants,

 a similar observation was made that where there is a material application for a correction and a correction is indeed then made, time runs from the date of the award as corrected. but in the similar context of a request to correct an award, in that case as referred to in art 33, in brq and another v brs and another and another matter [2019] sghc 260, vinodh coomaraswamy j rejected the need for materiality, pointing out in particular at [53] that the english legislative provision was not only not based on the model law, but also adopted “a diametrically different scheme for time limits for challenging an award from that adopted in the model law”. on appeal, in brs v brq at [69]–[72], it was held that it was necessary that the substance of a request under art 33 must come within the scope of art 33 for it to have the effect of extending the initial time limit under art 34(3), so that a mere request did not automatically bring postponement but the request could be examined for its substance to determine if time should be extended; however, the court of appeal arrived at this finding without reference to daewoo. daewoo is a very different case, and gives no support for treating the date of a correction pursuant to art 33(2) as the date of the award, or the award as corrected as the award, for the purposes of art 34(3).52 it is not as simple as art 34(3) providing for postponement only in the case of a request for correction, and ms chong submitted also to the effect that a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative would be minor (referring in particular to the court in brs v brq likening a request under art 33(1)(a) to what is often referred to in court proceedings as the slip rule (at [70])), and had to be within thirty days, so that there was no need for postponement of the commencement of the three-month period.

 however, the matter can be taken further.53  article 34(3) postpones the commencement of the three-month period not by providing that the receipt of the award becomes the receipt of the corrected award, or of a response declining correction. that is, the date on which the party making the application “had received the award”, prior to the making of any request (which necessarily means receipt of the original award), remains the date on which the original award was received. but in the case of a request for correction, a differently ascertained date, namely the date on which the request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal, is substituted as the commencement of the three-month period. postponement in that way is no doubt adopted because there are three different kinds of request, and it is also necessary to accommodate when a request for correction, interpretation or an additional award is declined by the arbitral tribunal, so that there is no award as corrected, interpreted or supplemented. but it means that the determinant of the date of the receipt of the award is unchanged from the receipt of the original award itself: in art 34(3), it remains the original award.54 the same determinant is also used in arts 33(1) and (3) in stipulating the period of thirty days from receipt of the award within which a request for correction, interpretation or an additional award must be made. in those sub-articles, “the award” cannot mean the award as corrected, interpreted or supplemented, otherwise there would be a reopening of the period of thirty days if the arbitral tribunal acceded to the request and corrected, interpreted or supplemented the award. similarly, in art 33(2), “the award” in the stipulation of thirty days from the date of the award must mean the original award: the thirty days do not start to run again upon the arbitral tribunal making a correction on its own initiative simply because the award as corrected becomes the award.55 in art 34(3), then, as in its appearances in art 33, “the award” in the phrase “the date on which the party making that application had received the award” means the original award, which is in the present case the awards dated 18 february 2023. if postponement of the date of receipt of that award is to come from a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s initiative, it must be found elsewhere in the same manner that postponement in the case of a request for correction is found in the latter part of the sub-article. it is, however, not to be found. 56 the scheme makes good sense, in line with the attributes of speed and finality. the correction of an error in computation or a clerical or typographical error, or an error of similar nature, which the arbitral tribunal considers it can make on its own initiative, is unlikely to be contentious – and that is so even if the error in computation has an effect on the bottom line of the award, because it can readily be corrected once recognised. in a decision of the iran–us claims tribunal, to which rco referred,

 harold birnbaum and islamic republic of iran, dec 124-967-2 (14 december 1995), such a correction was described as “a restoration of the award’s proper contents” (at [10]). that can be seen as the reason the model law does not include the statement that a correction, whether pursuant to the request of a party or on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative and as distinct from an interpretation, shall form part of the award: it is regarded as already part of the award, and by the correction is simply recognised and made apparent. 57 a party dissatisfied with an award has three months to examine it for a ground or grounds to challenge it, and its examination and decision on whether to challenge the award is unlikely to be impeded or altered by a correction made by the arbitral tribunal on its own initiative. and in any event, the correction must be made within the thirty days: the party still has two months to come to its decision. the time can therefore continue to run from the receipt of the original award, in the interests of speed and finality, without injustice to a potential challenger. in comparison, if a request is made under art 33 it is more likely to be substantive and contentious in the case of interpretation or an additional award, or contentious even in the case of a computation, clerical, typographical or similar error where a request to the arbitral tribunal is considered necessary. the decision on the request may not be known until close to the expiry of the three-month period or until it has expired, as the tribunal may extend if necessary the period of time within which it shall made a correction, interpretation or an additional award under art 33(4), and this may affect the party’s decision on whether to challenge the award. therefore, there is a provision for the postponement of the commencement of the three-month period. in gist, needless passage of time in the case of a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative is avoided, but an appropriate passage of time is allowed in the case of a request for correction.58 contrary to the applicants’ submissions, this does not mean an absurd defeating of the arbitral tribunal’s power to correct an award. any correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative must be within 30 days of the award, well within the three-month period, and the correction is still effective: the award which is enforced, and also the award which is challenged, is the award as corrected. nor is there incongruity by contrast with postponement of the three-month period in the case of a request for correction, but rather there is a sensible scheme as outlined in the preceding paragraph.the answer to the question59 the applicants “had received the award” on 6 march 2023. the three-month time period commenced with the applicants’ receipt of the awards dated 18 february 2023 on 6 march 2023, the corrections did not affect that commencement, and the application was thus brought out of time.60 this is sufficient for dismissal of the application. i nonetheless go on to consider the grounds on which it was brought.ground (a): no valid arbitration agreement between aco and rcothe ground in brief61 article 34(2)(a)(i) of the model law provides:(2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in article 6 only if:(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that:(i) a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of this state; or…62 from a’s affidavits in support of the application, and in the applicants’ written submissions in advance of the hearing, it was the applicants’ principal case that there were no valid arbitration agreements either between aco and rco or between a and rco, because the arbitration clause in the terms had not been incorporated into the letter.

 he did not materially add to the written submissions, which left some difficulty in his case as it essentially rested upon a not knowing of the terms.71 the contract under which the facility was provided was not in question – unsurprisingly, since aco had used the facility for a number of years. it was found in the letter, which was signed by a as the authorised signatory of aco, and despite a’s alleged inability to read english, it was not part of aco’s case that the contract was not binding on it. 72 it is established law that a party who signs a contractual document is bound by its terms even if the party has not read them. in bintai kindenko pte ltd v samsung c&t corp and another [2019] 2 slr 295 it was said by the court of appeal (at [58]–[59]):58 … it is a well-established principle that in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, a party is bound by all the terms of a contract that it signs, even if that party did not read or understand those terms: l’estrange v f graucob ltd [1934] 2 kb 394 at 403 and 406; amiri flight authority v bae systems plc [2004] 1 all er (comm) 385 at [16]; see also: the law of contract in singapore (andrew phang boon leong gen ed) (academy publishing, 2012) at paras 07.015–07.020; gerard mcmeel, the construction of contracts: interpretation, implication, and rectification (oxford university press, 2nd ed, 2011) at paras 15.62–15.66); the law of contract (michael furmston gen end) (lexis nexis, 6th ed, 2017) at paras 3.8–3.9.59 therefore, if a term in a signed contract incorporated some or all the terms of a separate document by making reference to those terms, the parties to the contract would be bound by those separate terms even if they did not have any knowledge of what those terms were at the time of contracting…73 fraud or misrepresentation was not alleged, at most failure to bring to a’s attention. in the letter, the opening and operation of the account was expressly subject to the terms, and even if a was not provided with a copy of the terms, or more widely was not aware of them or their content, they were incorporated as part of the contract. 74 more specifically as to the arbitration clause, whether the parties intended to incorporate it by making the opening and operation of the account subject to the terms which contained it is a question of interpretation of their contract (international research corp plc v lufthansa systems asia pacific pte ltd and another [2014] 1 slr 130 at [34]). arbitration clauses are commonplace in agreements such as the contract under which the facility was provided, and in the express subjection of the opening and operation of the account to the terms, there is no reason to parse the arbitration clause out and find that it was not incorporated. nor was it necessary to draw particular attention to the arbitration clause: it is sufficient to refer to the decision of the court of appeal in marty ltd v hualon corp (malaysia) sdn bhd (receiver and manager appointed) [2018] 2 slr 1207 at [77]:as a response to this approach, the respondent submits that it is necessary for the appellant to go one step further, and show, positively, that mr oung da ming had actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, for instance, by pointing to a statement made by mr oung da ming to that effect. we do not accept this submission because to do so would severely undermine the efficacy of arbitration agreements. if the respondent is right, then each time a party enters into a contract containing an arbitration agreement, it would have to enquire into whether the agent or officer who signed the agreement on behalf of the counterparty had actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, and obtain a statement from that person to that effect, or risk stymying future arbitration proceedings because of an assertion by the counterparty that despite being done by the underlying contract, it did not have knowledge of the arbitration clause specifically. this would place too onerous a burden on contracting parties seeking to arbitrate their disputes, and would run counter to our courts’ approach towards arbitration (see sundaresh menon ed, arbitration in singapore: a practical guide (sweet & maxwell, 2014) at para 2.002). it would also be completely contradictory to the well-established doctrine that a party who signs a document is deemed to know the contents of the same. in our view, a party who is bound by the underlying contract must also be taken to have actual knowledge of the contents of the same, including any arbitration clause contained therein.75  it does not matter that a says now that they would not have agreed to the arbitration clause in the terms, or indeed to cl 1.3 in the letter.76 in so far as it was independently said that the arbitration clause was not incorporated because it failed the tests for a unilateral arbitration clause, there is also no substance in the submission. 77 in pittalis, the question was whether a rent review clause which contemplated that only one of the parties could refer the matter to arbitration was an arbitration clause. fox lj held that it was an arbitration clause, saying (at 875):there is a fully bilateral agreement which constitutes a contract to refer. the fact that the option is exerciseable by one of the parties only seems to me to be irrelevant. the arrangement suits both parties. the reason why that is so in case such as the present and in the tote bookmakers case [1985] ch 261 is because the landlord is protected, if there is no arbitration, by his own assessment of the rent, as stated in his notice; and the tenant is protected, if he is dissatisfied with the landlord’s assessment of the rent, by his right to refer the matter to arbitration. both sides, therefore, have accepted the arrangement, and there is no question of any lack of mutuality. [emphasis added]78 the applicants’ submissions took from the emphasised sentence above that for a unilateral arbitration clause, it was necessary that both sides had agreed to the clause being a unilateral arbitration clause, so that there was mutuality in that respect; and, as i understand the argument, it was that aco had not agreed because, even if the terms in general were incorporated into the letter, attention had not been specifically drawn to the arbitration clause. however, his lordship was not saying that there is an additional need for agreement in the case of a unilateral arbitration clause, but was noting that the arrangement to which the parties had agreed, which happened to be a clause under which only one party could refer the matter to arbitration, suited both parties. the only question here is whether the terms were incorporated in the letter; if they were, the arbitration clause was incorporated together with the other terms and conditions. 79 in dyna-jet, the question was whether there should be a stay of court proceedings said to have been brought in breach of an arbitration agreement. under the arbitration clause, a dispute could be referred to arbitration “at the election of” dyna-jet, which was described as asymmetrical. the court of appeal said (at [13]), referring to the requirement that there be a valid arbitration agreement:in respect of the first of the three requirements outlined at [11] above, we agree with the judge and also the appellant that the clause constituted a valid arbitration agreement between the appellant and the respondent. it was immaterial for this purpose that the clause: (a) entitled only the respondent (but not the appellant) to compel its counterparty to arbitrate a dispute (the “lack of mutuality” characteristic); and (b) made arbitration of a future dispute entirely optional, instead of placing parties under an immediate obligation to arbitrate their disputes (the “optionality” characteristic). on the weight of modern, commonwealth authority, which the judge considered, neither of these features prevented the court from finding that there was a valid arbitration agreement between the present parties. and before us, neither party contended otherwise.80 the court went on to hold that the dispute was not within the arbitration clause because dyna-jet had elected to litigate by commencing the court proceedings. it did not state a particular requirement for the validity of a unilateral or an asymmetrical arbitration clause; on the contrary, it recognised the accepted validity of such a clause. again, the only question is whether the terms were incorporated into the letter. if they were, the arbitration clause was incorporated together with the other terms and conditions in the terms.the other reasons81 i go to the applicants’ reasons in addition to failure in incorporation of the terms. two submissions were made.82 the first was that the arbitration clause was void because the contract under which the facility was provided was an illegal contract; the contract was unenforceable, and so was the arbitration clause if part of the contract. the illegality was the same illegality as was asserted under ground (c) for the awards being contrary to the public policy of singapore.

  aws at para 103(a). 



 it is sufficient to state here that for the reasons given when dealing with that ground, the contract was not illegal.83 the second was that the letter was “unreasonable” in that cl 1.3 gave rco the ability to revise the terms, including the arbitration clause, placing aco in great uncertainty; it was said that “well-informed consent” had not been given to “such an unreasonable arbitration clause”, apparently treating the arbitration clause as something which could be revised.

 provisions such as cl 1.3, so far as it permitted revision of the terms, are commonplace, and aco agreed to it by a’s signature. they are valid, although generally subject to reasonableness or prevention of caprice. whether cl 1.3 would extend to revision of the arbitration clause, if the question arose, could be a matter for decision, but that does not, in some manner unexplained in the submissions, mean failure in incorporation of the arbitration clause. the submission is without substance. ground (b): notice of the arbitration proceedingsthe ground in brief84 article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the model law provides:(2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in article 6 only if:(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that: …(ii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or…85 the applicants’ case was that a, who was also the sole director of aco, did not have notice of the arbitration proceedings and was not aware that the proceedings were taking place.

88 it will be noted that the statement that notice of the arbitration proceedings was not received is qualified: “[t]o the best of my knowledge”. this was not explained, and detracts from the weight to be given to the statement. nothing is said about notice through the 163 email address, which during the arbitrations, was a functioning address used in communications from the tribunal and rco’s lawyers (see [41]), and from the earlier discussion of whether the application was brought within time, was later the means of effective delivery of the corrections to the applicants (see [40]). it will be noted also that, while a says they have not received any notices from rco that were sent to hong kong, which must mean the hard copy notices, there is no such denial in relation to notices sent to the bvi address.89 as earlier mentioned, in each award the tribunal recorded satisfaction that reasonable and sufficient efforts had been made to provide due notice to the relevant applicant, and to provide them with a fair opportunity to be heard and participate (see [22]). rco submitted that these were findings of fact, fully analysed and supported in the awards, which it was not open to the applicants to contest, citing jiangsu overseas group co ltd v concord energy pte ltd and another matter [2016] 4 slr 1336 at [43] and beijing sinozonto mining investment co ltd v goldenray consortium (singapore) pte ltd [2014] 1 slr 814 at [52].

 perhaps making an unnecessarily cautious distinction, it may be thought that the question is not whether rco made reasonable and sufficient efforts to give notice of the arbitral proceedings, but whether it did give notice of the arbitral proceedings. most probably the tribunal meant that it did, but in the circumstances, i will pass on from the tribunal’s satisfaction and consider whether the applicants have furnished proof that they were not given notice of the arbitral proceedings.actual notice90 the notice of arbitration was served on aco at the bvi address, its registered address as a bvi company according to the client information statement and not denied in the evidence, by courier on 14 august 2020.

 as with notice to aco, i am not satisfied that a has furnished proof that they were not given proper notice of the arbitral proceedings, and on the contrary, am satisfied they were given actual notice whereby they were well aware of the arbitral proceedings and had full opportunity to present their case. 93 a sufficient basis for these findings is that the bvi address was aco’s registered address and the 163 email address was a functioning email address, used by a on behalf of aco. in any event, the various addresses are given in the client information statement (see [13]). the purpose of the client information statement was to tell rco the means of communication with aco, and with a as a person giving instructions in relation to the facility and the account, to which the guarantee must be added as a part of the provision of the facility. the observations in re shanghai xinan screenwall building & decoration co ltd [2022] 5 slr 393 (“re shanghai”) at [32], holding that that delivery of a notice of arbitration to the address stated in the contract between the parties was proper notice of the arbitration, are applicable:thirdly, the address to which the various documents were delivered was the address indicated in the contract. where an address is given in a contract, it is a simple inference that the address has been included to facilitate communication between the parties. thus, in the absence of any manifestation of a contrary intention, service of a notice of arbitration in respect of that contract at that address will usually amount to proper notice of the arbitration unless prior to the date of service the respondent has notified the claimant of a change of address.94 in the present case, there is also not just an inference from giving addresses in the client information statement. by cl 7 of the letter, a communication to aco in connection with the account “shall be … made”, inter alia, by post or otherwise in writing to the address set out in the application for the account “or such other address … as you may from time to time notify us in writing”.

  margin facility letter from rco to aco at p 5 (cmb volume 3 at p 792).



 article 3(1) of the model law provides, inter alia, that unless otherwise agreed, a written communication is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address. the uncitral rules, which by the arbitration clause in the terms were the rules for the aco arbitration, provide, inter alia, that notice provided by any means to an address designated by the party for the purpose of receiving notifications, or delivered to the addressee’s place of business, habitual, residence, or mailing address is deemed to have been received. the siac rules, which by the arbitration clause in the guarantee were the rules for the a arbitration, provide, inter alia, that any notice shall be deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or to the addressee’s habitual residence, place of business or designated address, or any address agreed by the parties, and specifically permits electronic communication. 97 in re shanghai, it was said (at [33]) that deemed service may be rebutted by appropriate evidence of non-receipt, but in the absence of such evidence, service in a manner satisfying art 3(1) of the model law was held to be proper notice of the arbitral proceedings. in the present case, there is the evidence of a referred to above. i do not regard it as acceptable evidence of non-receipt. the direct assertion that aco and a did not receive any notice of the arbitral proceedings is qualified, but even if the qualification is put aside, it is plainly incorrect in the light of the mass of evidence from which there must have been actual knowledge of the arbitral proceedings. without going into detail, by force of these provisions also aco and a received proper notice of the arbitral proceedings.98 it remains to refer to a’s assertion that even if they had received email notices, they could not understand them because they did not read or understand english. i have expressed reservations about the lack of at least a basic facility in english (see [68]), and the contention that inability to read or understand english would make service of notice of the arbitral proceedings ineffective does not sit well with effective provision and use of the facility by signature of the letter in english. nonetheless, mr ang submitted that if the notice of arbitration was served on a via their email address, they would not have been validly notified given that they cannot read or write english.

 a similar submission was not made as to notice to aco, but i take that to have been intended.99 the short answer to the submission is that both arbitration clauses provided that the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be english. for the reasons given above, aco was bound by the arbitration clause in the terms, and a did not dispute the validity of the arbitration agreement in the guarantee. for the longer answer, it is not reasonably to be thought that a would not recognise the notice of arbitration or the rest of the numerous communications as documents written in english, and as significant documents from rco (for example, at the very least, rco’s name in english in the notices of arbitration would have been recognised from the same name in english in the monthly and daily statements, and by the time of the notices of arbitration, action by rco to recover the outstanding balance of the account must have been anticipated). if indeed a did not have a sufficient facility in english to read and understand the notice of arbitration or other documents, it was open to them to obtain assistance. the applicants cannot deny notice of the arbitral proceedings by turning a blind eye to the documents received by email or by delivery in hard copy.100 to sum up, the applicants have not proved that they were not given proper notice of the arbitral proceedings. on the contrary, they were given proper notice and had full opportunity to present their cases, but chose not to participate in the proceedings.ground (c): contrary to the public policy of singaporethe ground in brief101 article 34(2)(b)(ii) of the model law provides:(2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in article 6 only if:…(b) the court finds that:…(ii) the award is in conflict with the public policy of this state.102  the applicants’ principal basis for this ground was that in providing the facility, rco carried on a business in a regulated activity as referred to in the securities and futures ordinance (cap. 571) of hong kong (the “ordinance”) without the licence required under the ordinance; and that this was an offence under the ordinance, so that the provision of the facility was illegal in hong kong.

 for reasons then given, mr tisdall says that hong kong law is clear that a person cannot come under an obligation to be licensed under the ordinance if he carries on a business in the equivalent of a regulated activity outside hong kong, or holds himself out as carrying on a business in a regulated activity in hong kong while he is outside hong kong (and he adds that this is the well-understood position of the market in hong kong and the position adopted by the commission).

  mr stephen tisdall’s report at para 33 (cmb volume 8 at p 1787). 



 112 specifically as to margin financing, mr tisdall says that the position is clear under hong kong law that a person who conducts margin financing business outside hong kong is not to be regarded as carrying on a business in the relevant regulated activity by virtue of the fact that he provides margin financing services to clients in hong kong. he adds that it is very common for members of the public in hong kong to be the clients of international firms which have no presence in hong kong, and which are neither licensed under the ordinance nor required to be licensed under the ordinance. the clients may have taken the initiative to seek out the services of the overseas firms or may have been referred to them on the recommendation of third parties, and these circumstances, he says, involve no holding out or active marketing in hong kong on the part of such overseas firms.

 implicitly, i understand him to include deemed carrying on or holding out through active marketing to the public of hong kong. he said that, as he understood the position, neither of those activities occurred in hong kong, and therefore he considers that rco was not required to be licensed in hong kong under the ordinance and did not commit an offence when it provided margin financing services to aco.

for completeness, i should add that, even in the event of [rco] having to be licensed under [the ordinance], there is no provision in [the ordinance] which would render the transaction under the margin facility letter (and consequently, the claims brought by [rco] in the underlying arbitrations), illegal or unenforceable by virtue of [rco’s] unlicensed status in hong kong.115 mr tisdall is highly qualified in the field, his analysis of when rco would come under an obligation to be licenced under the ordinance appears sound, and i accept it. however, his understanding of the position that rco was not physically carrying on a business in a regulated activity in hong kong or holding itself out in hong kong as carrying on such a business came from the matters he assumed for the purposes of his report.

 not all his features were on point or soundly based in the evidence. in a summary of those that could be, they were that: (a) aco had an address in hong kong; (b) the letter was signed in hong kong; (c) the hong kong dollar was the nominated currency in the letter and the account was conducted in hong kong dollars (at least until april 2018, when it became singapore dollars); (d) the securities provided by aco included shares in hong kong listed companies; (e) correspondence with a was in chinese, the official language of hong kong; and (f) aco had no business presence in singapore, and according to a's passport pages, a had not been to singapore at all material times.119 as earlier indicated, there was a dearth of evidence of the circumstances in which the facility was provided. in their affidavits, a gave none, save for saying that the copies of the pages of their passport showed that they were not in singapore when the letter was executed

 but in the absence of more direct evidence from rco’s side, that is a weak point. in the incomplete state of the evidence, the likelihood is that aco was indeed referred by rcohk to rco for provision of the facility, and that the letter was signed in hong kong, and i proceed on that basis. 120  rco’s business premises were in singapore, and it did not have any business premises in hong kong. there was no evidence of any other business activity by rco (as distinct from rcohk) in hong kong, of margin financing or anything else, including any holding itself out in a business activity. indeed, rco’s ceo said squarely in his evidence that rco “does not conduct any business in hong kong and does not conduct marketing activities for its services in hong kong”.

121 even if the letter was signed in hong kong, there is no proper basis for concluding that there was marketing by rco of its margin financing services to aco, let alone to the public of hong kong, or that in agreeing to provide the facility, rco was carrying on a business in hong kong in that regulated activity or holding itself out as carrying on that business. the designation and use of hong kong dollars does not change that, nor the use of the chinese language. nor does the fact that aco used the facility for trading on the hong kong stock exchange help to make provision of the facility an unlicensed business activity of rco in hong kong (and i do not think that mr ang submitted that it did): that was aco’s business, not rco’s, as permitted but not required under the terms of the facility. that aco had an address in hong kong but no business premises in singapore is not of material significance when asking where the business of the international financing transaction was carried out; of more significance is what was done in that transaction and where, but the fact that the letter in a one-off transaction was signed in hong kong is not enough. 122 to the assumptions on which mr tisdall came to his opinion that it was not necessary that rco be licensed should be added that the letter was signed in hong kong, but i do not think that materially affects his opinion. i conclude independently that in providing the facility, rco was not carrying on a business in a regulated activity in hong kong, or holding itself out in hong kong as carrying on such a business, including by active marketing to the public of hong kong.123 it follows that the provision of the facility was not illegal in hong kong, and that that basis for the ground falls away. i nonetheless go on to consider whether, if the provision of the facility had been illegal in hong kong, there would have been conflict with the public policy of singapore warranting setting the awards aside.124 it is well established that the ground in art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the model law is a narrow ground. in pt asuransi jana indonesia (persero) v dexia bank sa [2007] 1 slr(r) 597 (“pt asuransi”) at [59], the court of appeal said:although the concept of public policy of the state is not defined in the act or the model law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under the act encompasses a narrow scope. in our view, it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would “shock the conscience” (see downer connect ([58] supra) at [136]) or is “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public” (see deutsche schachbau v shell international petroleum co ltd [1987] 2 lloyds’ rep 246 at 254, per sir john donaldson mr), or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice: see parsons & whittemore overseas co inc v societe generale de l’industrie du papier (rakta) 508 f 2d 969 (2nd cir, 1974) at 974. this would be consistent with the concept of public policy that can be ascertained from the preparatory materials to the model law. as was highlighted in the commission report (a/40/17), at para 297 (referred to in a guide to the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration: legislative history and commentary by howard m holtzmann and joseph e neuhaus (kluwer, 1989) at p 914): in discussing the term “public policy”, it was understood that it was not equivalent to the political stance or international policies of a state but comprised the fundamental notions and principles of justice… it was understood that the term “public policy”, which was used in the 1958 new york convention and many other treaties, covered fundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well as procedural respects. thus, instances such as corruption, bribery or fraud and similar serious cases would constitute a ground for setting aside. 125 in sui southern gas co ltd v habibullah coastal power co (pte) ltd [2010] 3 slr 1 at [48], judith prakash j referred to a party having to cross a “very high threshold” and demonstrate “egregious circumstances such as corruption, bribery or fraud, which would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice” (see also baz v bba and others and other matters [2020] 5 slr 266 at [156]–[159]).126 while in their submissions, the applicants recognised the authority of pt asuransi, they submitted that what they called the principles in ralli brothers v companiera naviera sota y aznar [1920] 2 kb 287 (“ralli bros”) and soleimany v soleimany [1991] 1 qb 785 (“soleimany”) should be applied in the present case.

 just what those principles were said to be was not made clear. 127 ralli bros was not concerned with setting aside an award for conflict with the public policy of the forum state pursuant to art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the model law. it was a case of refusal under english law to enforce part of a contract the performance of which was illegal under spanish law. 128 soleimany was a case of an english court refusing on english public policy grounds to enforce an award made by a jewish religious court, the beth din, giving effect to an underlying contract that was illegal under the law of iran, which was the law of the place of performance; under jewish law, however, the illegality of that contract did not affect the rights of the parties. it was held that the english court could reopen the beth din’s position as to illegality and that the interposition of an award despite illegality could not exclude consideration of illegality as going to english public policy. however, in aju v ajt [2011] 4 slr 739 (“aju v ajt”), the court of appeal rejected the approach in soleimany as to the more liberal circumstances in which the court may reopen an arbitral tribunal’s decision that an underlying contract is legal (at [58]–[60]); while the court is entitled to decide for itself whether the underlying contract is illegal and to set aside the award if tainted by illegality, it cannot correct findings of fact going to illegality (at [59] and [70]). 129 as i understand the submission, it was that the principles in these cases were that the court should not assist or sanction the breach of the laws of other independent states (ralli bros), including by declining to enforce an award made on a contract that was illegal under the laws of such a state (soleimany) and so also by setting aside such an award. but ralli bros was a case on english domestic law, and soleimany also was not concerned with setting aside an award for conflict with the public policy of the forum state pursuant to art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the model law. the issue in that case was not the present issue, and the dominance of the policy of refusal to enforce an illegal contract underlying the reasoning of waller lj in soleimany (at 823–824) is undermined by aju v ajt. neither case warrants departure from the established law in pt asuransi and like cases: it must be asked whether the very high threshold has been crossed.130 the applicants referred to z v y [2018] hkcfi 2342 as an instance of refusal to enforce an award on the ground, amongst others, of illegality in a foreign jurisdiction.

 the award was made by the china guangzhou arbitration commission, on a guarantee of certain sale contracts (at [3]). in the arbitration, the respondent alleged that the sale contracts were shams and were a façade for illegal moneylending, but the claim was upheld (at [4]). section 95(3)(b) of the arbitration ordinance cap 609 provided for refusal of enforcement if enforcement would be “contrary to public policy”. while acknowledging that the court of enforcement should not review the merits of the award, the court considered it unclear whether the tribunal had thoroughly considered the issues of illegality raised by the respondent, and expressed “serious reservations” as to the reasons given by the tribunal for dismissing the respondent’s allegations (at [10]). the court said (at [14]):the important issue of whether the underlying hd contracts and md contracts were illegal and unenforceable under prc law, so as to render the guarantee void and unenforceable against the respondent, is not in my view addressed in the award with adequate reasons, and it would offend our court’s notions of fairness and justice to enforce the award when it might be tainted by illegality, and when a significant issue brought before the tribunal for determination has not been seen to be properly considered and determined, contrary to the parties’ legitimate and reasonable expectations.131  i do not think that this case assists the applicants. whatever may otherwise be said of the decision, it was not a refusal to enforce the award because of illegality of the underlying contracts under prc law; the offence to public policy was in the way the issue was dealt with. 132 a decision of more assistance, to which rco referred, is gokul patnaik v nine rivers capital ltd [2021] 3 slr 22.

 an issue in the arbitration was whether a contract was illegal because it was in contravention of the indian foreign exchange management (transfer or issue of security by a person resident outside india) regulations (india) (at [129]). the tribunal held that they were not, and in an application to set the award aside sir vivian ramsay ij declined to intervene in that holding (at [192]). his honour went on, however, to deal with the public policy ground in the model law on the assumption that the contracts were illegal. his discussion included (at [202]) that international comity did not mean that a contract illegal by the law of the country of performance would always not be enforced, or set aside, as a matter of singapore public policy, and concluded, at [205]–[206]: 205. the relevant question is whether the illegality in the foreign state would demonstrate sufficiently egregious circumstances that would “shock the conscience” or violate the most basic notions of morality and justice so as to amount to a breach of singapore public policy.206. in the present case, there is no reason why a breach of the fema regulations or the laws of india, without more, would “shock the conscience” or violate the “most basic notions of morality and justice”. if mr patnaik’s submissions are taken to their logical conclusion, then any minor illegality or regulatory infringement by a contract in its place of performance would ipso facto lead to the conclusion that international comity, and thus singapore public policy, would be breached so that the arbitral award would have to be set aside. the public policy ground under art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the model law is a narrow ground and does not lead to that conclusion…133 it bears emphasis that simply to find illegality of some kind under the foreign law is not enough. if illegality is found, it must be assessed for the offence to the public policy of singapore of enforcement nonetheless, with the very high threshold to which the authorities refer. mr ang submitted that conducting a regulated activity without a licence is a criminal offence, and can bring a substantial penalty up to imprisonment for seven years or a fine of hkd 5m if there is conviction on indictment; and he said (although i think without a proper basis) that the illegality on rco’s part was intentional.

  mr stephen tisdall’s report at para 39 (cmb volume 8 at p 1788).



 where the law of hong kong, on the evidence before me, does not invalidate the provision of margin financing by an unlicensed provider, there is insufficient reason to hold that upholding the awards despite the illegality of the provision of the margin financing without a licence would shock the conscience, be clearly injurious to the public good, be wholly offensive to the reasonable and fully informed member of the public, violate singapore’s most basic notion of morality and justice, or otherwise conflict with the public policy of singapore in accordance with the authorities.134 accordingly, had the provision of the facility been illegal in hong kong, i would nonetheless not have set aside the awards on the ground of conflict with the public policy of singapore.convention of the code135 a’s affidavit on behalf of aco foreshadowed a considerable number of contraventions of the code,

 (a) failing to provide a copy of the letter to a in chinese, despite knowing that their preferred language was chinese; (b) failing to inform either aco or a of the existence of the terms or the securities margin trading account terms and conditions, or to provide a copy of them prior to execution of the letter; (c) failing to draw to the applicants’ attention what were said to be a number of “risks” under the letter, some being the choice of singapore law instead of hong kong law, the choice of english for arbitration instead of chinese, and the deprivation of the right to choose the forum of dispute (which i take to mean that the arbitration clause was a unilateral arbitration clause); and (d) prescribing a margin ratio of 140% in the letter instead of the maximum allowable of 120%.136 i do not explore the validity of the submissions of contravention of the code, which required some reliance on the report of mr chan. the short answer is that, unless rco was licensed or had to be licensed because it was carrying on a business in a regulated activity, the code did not apply and require its compliance. that may be self-evident, but in any event was in the evidence of mr tisdall. rco was not licensed or required to be licensed, so there could not be the contraventions of the code as the basis for the ground.137  it is unnecessary to consider in detail whether, if there had been the contraventions, they would have brought conflict with the public policy of singapore so as to warrant setting aside the awards. the only evidence of the consequences under hong kong law of a breach of the code was in mr chan’s report,

 and was that by its article 1.4(a) a failure by any person to comply with any provision of the code that applies to it “shall not by itself render it liable to any judicial or other proceedings, but in any proceedings under the sfo before any court the code shall be admissible in evidence, and if any provision in the code appears to the court to be relevant to any questions arising in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining the question”. so far as the evidence went, a contravention of the code would not affect the transaction to which compliance with the code related, or even give rise to an offence. taking up the preceding discussion in relation to illegality through carrying on a business in a regulated activity, the threshold for conflict with the public policy of singapore would not have been approached, and certainly would not have been crossed.138 there was no illegality in hong kong through contravention of the code, and if there had been i would nonetheless not have set the awards aside on the ground of conflict with the public policy of singapore.  choice of the rules of the singapore stock exchange and of singapore law139 the submission was that the choices were “improper” and “unfair”: they are the words used by mr ang.

 but that was not maintained subsequently. at the hearing, the complaint was put forward under the present ground (c), joined by the improper and unfair choice of the rules of the singapore stock exchange. what was meant by “improper” and “unfair”, and the legal significance of the terms, was obscure, and why either led to sufficient conflict with the public policy of singapore was not explained.140 the submission of impropriety seemed to have two limbs. 141 in one limb, it was said that because the letter was signed in hong kong, the trading was in stocks on the hong kong stock exchange, and the account was kept in hong kong dollars until april 2018, the facility had “nothing to do with” the rules of the singapore stock exchange or singapore law; rather, it had connections with hong kong as the letter was signed in hong kong and the hong kong dollar was the currency in the letter and of the account.

 and there is no reason why such of the rules as were relevant should not be incorporated into the contract under which the facility was provided; it would be a matter of interpretation whether and how the rules applied in the event of trading on some other exchange. there is also no reason why the parties to the contract could not choose singapore law as the governing law, or some other law as is often done in commercial contracts even if the law is but remotely connected with the subject matter of the contract. there was nothing improper in these respects even remotely apt to bring conflict with the public policy of singapore.143 as i understand the other limb, it was said that the code stated that the client agreement could not remove, exclude or restrict any rights of the client or obligations of the licensed or registered person under hong kong law; that the code thereby denied the operation of the rules of the singapore stock exchange or singapore law to the extent that they did so; and therefore that the choices of the rules of the singapore stock exchange and of singapore law were improper.

 there is nothing to this limb of the submission either. to begin with, as earlier explained, the code did not apply to rco’s provision of the facility. if it had applied, the consequence may have been to negate such terms of the contract under which the facility was provided as in conflict with the code; but the choice of law would not have been wholesale struck down, and again there was nothing improper even remotely apt to bring conflict with the public policy of singapore. 144 the submission of unfairness seemed to rest upon there being a number of requirements of the code which it was said were not found in the rules of the singapore stock exchange: for example, it was said that the code required a licensed or registered person to give the client a copy of the written agreement and all supporting documents in either english or chinese according to the language preference of the client, and to draw the client’s attention to relevant risks, but the rules of the singapore stock exchange did not have similar requirements.

 as i understand the submission, it was that choosing to subject the margin financing to the singapore stock exchange rules (and singapore law was referred to as one of the risks) was therefore not fair to the applicants. 145 this again assumed that the code applied to rco’s provision of the facility, but it did not. the submission therefore falls away. and if the code had applied, there would not be unfairness, because it would impose the relevant requirements; the hong kong legislative requirements would have applied on top of the contractual importation of the rules of the singapore stock exchange. the submission is flawed, and there is no basis at all for conflict with singaporean public policy.conclusion146  the application was brought out of time, and in any event, none of the grounds for setting the awards aside has been made out. the application is dismissed.147 it is difficult to see any order as to costs other than that the applicants pay rco’s costs of the application, and that also is ordered; however, since the parties have not been heard on costs, with liberty to apply within 10 days for any other or additional order as to costs. the liberty may be exercised by letter to the registry. if the parties are unable to agree on the amount of costs within 30 days, they should so inform the registry, and directions will be given for determination of the amount of costs.roger gilesinternational judgeang cheng ann alfonso and james ch’ng chin leong (a.ang, seah & hoe) for the applicants;chong wan yee monica, leau jun li, wong chun mun and foo hsien weng (wongpartnership llp) for the respondent.
