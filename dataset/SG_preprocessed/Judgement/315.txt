10 india also contended that it would be in the interests of justice for this court to grant the orders sought. there was a real risk that india would suffer prejudice if the sum 4 orders sought were not granted because information relating to the arbitration had already been misused by third parties (such as an entity known as “devasfacts”) to portray india negatively.

the law on protecting the confidentiality of arbitrations and related proceedings14 i begin with the observation that the court may grant a sealing order pursuant to its inherent powers to regulate its own processes and make appropriate orders to achieve the ends of justice (re tay quan li leon [2022] 5 slr 896 (“leon tay”) at [22]–[23]; bbw v bbx and others [2016] 5 slr 755 at [25]–[30], referring to the inherent powers of court reflected in o 92 r 4 of the rules of court (cap 322, 2014 rev ed)). however, the general rule is that the making of such privacy orders is a departure from the hallowed principle of open justice and should therefore be the exception rather than the norm. this is so because open justice is fundamental to ensuring public confidence in and the integrity of the judicial system (leon tay at [17]).15 that being said, the general rule may be departed from in certain circumstances – for instance, in cases involving an abuse of process or the need to prevent a miscarriage of justice or when a statute provides otherwise. the last of this was relevant here because the appeal pertained to arbitration-related proceedings, and the court’s power to grant privacy orders has been statutorily provided for in ss 22 and 23 of the iaa, which read as follows:proceedings to be heard in private22.—(1)  subject to subsection (2), proceedings under this act in any court are to be heard in private.(2)  proceedings under this act in any court are to be heard in open court if the court, on its own motion or upon the application of any person (including a person who is not a party to the proceedings), so orders.restrictions on reporting of proceedings heard in private23.—(1)  this section applies to proceedings under this act in any court heard in private.(2)  a court hearing any proceedings to which this section applies is, on the application of any party to the proceedings, to give directions as to whether any and, if so, what information relating to the proceedings may be published.(3)  a court is not to give a direction under subsection (2) permitting information to be published unless —(a) all parties to the proceedings agree that the information may be published; or(b) the court is satisfied that the information, if published in accordance with such directions as it may give, would not reveal any matter, including the identity of any party to the proceedings, that any party to the proceedings reasonably wishes to remain confidential.(4)  despite subsection (3), where a court gives grounds of decision for a judgment in respect of proceedings to which this section applies and considers that judgment to be of major legal interest, the court is to direct that reports of the judgment may be published in law reports and professional publications but, if any party to the proceedings reasonably wishes to conceal any matter, including the fact that the party was such a party, the court is to —(a) give directions as to the action that is to be taken to conceal that matter in those reports; and(b) if it considers that a report published in accordance with directions given under paragraph (a) would be likely to reveal that matter, direct that no report may be published until after the end of any period, not exceeding 10 years, that it considers appropriate.16 the effect of s 22(1) of the iaa is that proceedings under the iaa are to be heard in private by default. therefore, court proceedings relating to arbitration matters under the iaa are presumptively private as a starting point. moreover, this is so without the need for any application by a party, though the court may nonetheless, on its own motion, or on the application of a party, order that the hearing take place in open court (see s 22(2) of the iaa). where proceedings are to be heard in private, the court may issue further directions pursuant to s 23 of the iaa to permit the disclosure of information in a way that would protect each party’s reasonable interest in confidentiality. for completeness, o 16 r 9(1)(a) and o 16 r 9(1)(b) of the sicc rules 2021 also afford the court similar powers to make orders for a private hearing and for restrictions on publication. these effectively mirror ss 22 and 23 of the iaa respectively, though the court’s powers under the sicc rules 2021 are not limited to the context of arbitration-related proceedings. 17 however, beyond setting out the position on the terms i have just outlined, ss 22 and 23 of the iaa shed limited light on the nature of the interest in confidentiality that is protected. i therefore approached the determination of that interest by considering the purpose that underlies these provisions, having regard to their legislative history. 18 the iaa was largely based on the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration (the “model law”). the drafters of the model law had been averse to proposals to provide for the confidentiality of arbitral awards, and so chose to leave the position open (uncitral, report of the secretary-general: possible features of a model law on international commercial arbitration, un doc a/cn.9/207 (14 may 1981) at para 101).19 when the iaa was first enacted on 27 january 1995, it did not include provisions in the form of the present ss 22 and 23. while parliament did make provision for the confidentiality of court proceedings arising from arbitrations in s 22, that position was essentially the reverse of the present position. in short, the default position under s 22 (as it was first enacted) was that such proceedings would be open, but these could be heard in private on application to the court. section 22 at the time provided as follows: proceedings to be heard otherwise than in open court22.  proceedings under this act in any court shall, on the application of any party to the proceedings, be heard otherwise than in open court.20 this remained the position for almost the next three decades until the present iteration of s 22 of the iaa came into effect on 1 april 2022 by virtue of the courts (civil and criminal justice) reform bill (bill no 18/2021). the overall effect of the amendment was to bring the legislation in line with what had become the prevailing practice by providing that court proceedings relating to arbitration will be private unless the court orders otherwise. significantly, the minister’s second reading speech clarified that parliament’s underlying intention was and had been to protect the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings (see singapore parliamentary debates, official report (13 september 2021) vol 95 (edwin tong chun fai, second minister for law)) (“the minister’s speech”):we have considered feedback from various stakeholders, practitioners, that as a matter of practice, it will be common for parties involved in proceedings, involving arbitration, such as in those two acts, to make applications, for the matter to be heard in private. given that these applications relate to arbitrations, such applications are often allowed by the court.hence, to better reflect the prevailing practice and streamline the process for parties, clauses 8 and 30 of the bill will amend the arbitration act and the international arbitration act respectively, to provide that proceedings under these acts are to be heard in private by default, unless the court orders that the proceedings be heard in open court.this is in line with the overall confidential nature of such arbitral proceedings and will result in cost and time savings for parties who now do not have to apply for such proceedings to be heard in private.[emphasis added]21 it follows that the confidentiality interest that was meant to be secured by the present, and in my view, even the original, iteration of s 22 of the iaa is ultimately linked to protecting the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings by ensuring that the related court proceedings are heard in private. in my judgment, this suggestion that is contained in the minister’s speech that i have extracted above also accords with a common-sense view of the matter. there is no independent interest in the confidentiality of court proceedings. on the contrary, such proceedings are almost always open. and so, when the court gets involved at the stage of enforcement or setting-aside proceedings, the reason why the statute provides for confidentiality is that this is rooted in the conventionally private nature of arbitration proceedings. but for this fact, there would typically be no question of the concomitant enforcement proceedings being conducted in private.22 in line with this, ss 23(3) and (4) provide that if the cloak of privacy is retained, the court may nonetheless publish certain information as long as steps are taken to protect the confidentiality of information that a party “reasonably wishes to remain confidential” or that a party “reasonably wishes to conceal”. it is clear from this that the interest is directed at preserving confidentiality.23 in sum, in my judgment, the purpose of ss 22 and 23 of the iaa is to protect the confidentiality of the arbitration itself and the interest in keeping any enforcement proceedings confidential under the iaa is essentially a derivative interest designed ultimately to protect the confidentiality of the underlying arbitration. this is borne out by the minister’s statement in parliament when the bill introducing these provisions was read, and also by the text of ss 22 and 23 read together in context. 24 this is also consistent with the fact, as i have noted above (at [14]), that imposing a cloak of privacy on court proceedings is an exceptional measure that departs from the general rule that such proceedings are subject to the principle of open justice. in the present context, the departure from that principle is provided for by statute, but given that this was rooted in the need to protect the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings, where the confidentiality of the arbitration has been lost, then the principle of open justice would weigh strongly in favour of lifting the cloak of privacy that has been provided for by the statute. 25 significantly, india did not appear to contend otherwise. as i have noted above at [9], india’s primary contention was that the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings had not been entirely lost.my decision26 as i have noted (at [8]), india relied on two bases: (a) ss 22 and 23 of the iaa read with o 16 r 9(1) of the sicc rules 2021, and/or (b) the inherent powers of the court. on either footing, the threshold question was whether the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings had been lost.27 in my judgment, this was clearly a case where the confidentiality of the arbitration had been lost, as a consequence of which there was no basis for maintaining the confidentiality of the enforcement proceedings in singapore under ss 22 and 23 of the iaa. in these circumstances, i was satisfied that there was insufficient basis to override the strong interest in open justice in curial proceedings. i elaborate on these points below.the confidentiality of the arbitration had been lost28 the court should not be made to go through an empty exercise to protect confidentiality when there is nothing left to protect. as was noted in dorsey james michael v world sport group pte ltd [2014] 2 slr 208 (“dorsey james") at [63], citing attorney-general v observer ltd [1990] 1 ac 109 at 282c (albeit with respect to the law of confidentiality): the first limiting principle (which is rather an expression of the scope of the duty) is … that the principle of confidentiality only applies to information to the extent that it is confidential. in particular, once it has entered what is usually called the public domain (which means no more than that the information in question is so generally accessible that, in all the circumstances, it cannot be regarded as confidential) then, as a general rule, the principle of confidentiality can have no application to it. [emphasis in original]29 if the information in question is known to the public at large, it would be idle (in the sense of being both unrealistic and pointless) to seek to deal with it as though it was confidential (dorsey james at [64], citing r g toulson and c m phipps, confidentiality (sweet & maxwell, 3rd ed, 2012) at para 3-112). indeed, as i have already observed (see above at [22]), s 23(3)(b) of the iaa speaks of protecting information that a party wishes to “remain” confidential which would suggest that the court is not required to protect information that is already in the public sphere. 30 as pointed out by dt, there had already been multiple disclosures of considerable information relating to the arbitration, the identity of the parties and enforcement proceedings in singapore and abroad.

 however, i did not think it was for the court to manage its processes in order to promote public debate. the decisions of this court are governed by the proper ambit of the statutory rules that apply to the court and applying those rules, the point simply was that there was no longer a basis to maintain india’s presumptive statutory entitlement to a private hearing under the iaa.42 therefore, the confidentiality of the enforcement proceedings in singapore did not merit continued protection under ss 22 and 23 of the iaa. for completeness, i turn briefly to consider the court’s inherent powers.there was no basis for the court to exercise its inherent powers to grant the sum 4 orders43 in my judgment, recourse to the inherent powers was unhelpful in the present context. it should be noted that india’s position was supported by the presumptive position of privacy provided for in the statute. india would only need to invoke the inherent powers as an alternative to the statutory position, and that would only be the case where the court had concluded that the presumptive statutory position had been displaced for good reason. in such circumstances, there would be no basis for invoking the court’s inherent powers unless this was done to protect some other interest that was independent of that protected by the statutory provision. that was not the case here because india’s position was advanced on essentially the same grounds, namely that the arbitration was confidential. having held that that was no longer the case here when considering the position under ss 22 and 23 of the iaa, an argument for the exercise of inherent power founded on the same grounds struck me as hopeless. it should be noted that the inherent powers of the court must be exercised judiciously based on the touchstone of necessity (siva kumar s/o avadiar v quek leng chuang and others [2021] 1 slr 451 at [57], citing wee soon kim anthony v law society of singapore [2001] 2 slr(r) 821 at [27]). the position could be otherwise if there was some other independent basis which warranted invoking the inherent powers of the court, but that was not the case here.44 india also submitted that the disclosure of information in the appeal would provide more ammunition for the efforts of third parties to tarnish india’s reputation

 and this justified invoking the court’s inherent powers. in support of its claim, india had exhibited twitter posts, website headlines, and statements

 from third parties such as “devasfacts” which appeared to express the opinion that india’s conduct with respect to the various arbitrations was repressive and wrongful. 45 i disagreed with india’s submission. an intrinsic feature of open justice is that the conduct of all parties is open to be scrutinised by those who may be interested. the private interest of a party not to be seen in an adverse light does not warrant a grant of privacy orders in a departure from the principle of open justice.46 in any event, i did not see how further information which would be disclosed in the appeal would assist these third parties in their alleged attempts to tarnish india’s reputation. to the contrary, in so far as there was public attention and controversy surrounding dt’s enforcement efforts, it would likely be in india’s interest to open the proceedings in the appeal so that the public could be apprised of its side of the story. 47 hence, i was satisfied that it was not in the interests of justice for the court to exercise its inherent powers to protect the confidentiality of the appeal or the present proceedings. conclusion48 in the circumstances, i dismissed sum 4 and ordered that the question of costs for sum 4 be reserved until after the hearing of the appeal. i also ordered that the security for costs that was provided by india would remain in place until further order of the court of appeal.sundaresh menonchief justicecavinder bull sc, lin shumin, ng shi min nicole and kenneth teo (drew and napier llc) for the applicant;koh swee yen sc, joel quek, axl rizqy and victoria liu (wongpartnership llp) for the respondent.
