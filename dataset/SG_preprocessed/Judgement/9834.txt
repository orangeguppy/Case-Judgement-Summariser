introduction
1       this is an appeal by yong vui kong (“the

                    appellant”) against the decision of the high court judge (“the

                    judge”) in yong vui kong v attorney-general

                    [2011] 1 slr 1 (“the hc judgment”) dismissing his judicial

                    review application in originating summons no 740 of 2010

                    (“os 740/2010”).
factual background
2       the events leading to the filing of

                    os 740/2010 are as follows. on 14 november 2008, the appellant was

                    convicted of trafficking in 47.27g of diamorphine, an offence under

                        s 5(1)(a) of the misuse of drugs act

                    (cap 185, 2001 rev ed) (“the mda”), and was sentenced to

                    death (see public prosecutor v yong vui kong

                    [2009] sghc 4 (“yong vui kong

                    (hc)”)). on 27 november 2008, he appealed, via criminal

                    appeal no 13 of 2008 (“cca 13/2008”), against both his

                    conviction and his sentence. subsequently, he indicated, via a letter dated

                    23 april 2009 from his then counsel, that he wished to withdraw

                    cca 13/2008. the court of appeal accepted the withdrawal of that appeal

                    when it came on for hearing on 29 april 2009, and dismissed it

                    formally.
3       after cca 13/2008 was formally dismissed,

                    the appellant submitted a petition to the president on 11 august 2009 for

                    clemency under art 22p of the constitution of the republic of singapore

                    (1985 rev ed, 1999 reprint) (“the singapore

                    constitution”). the president, acting on the advice of the cabinet,

                    declined on 20 november 2009 to grant clemency. on 30 november 2009,

                    four days before his death sentence was due to be carried out, the appellant,

                    through his current counsel, mr m ravi (“mr ravi”),

                    filed criminal motion no 41 of 2009 (“cm 41/2009”)

                    seeking leave to pursue his appeal to the court of appeal (ie, cca 13/2008) notwithstanding his earlier decision to

                    withdraw the appeal and its consequential formal dismissal. the ground relied on

                    by the appellant for seeking leave to pursue cca 13/2008 was that

                        (inter alia) he had earlier withdrawn that

                    appeal in the mistaken belief that he could not base it on the legal argument

                    that the mandatory death penalty prescribed for the offence of trafficking in

                    more than 15g of diamorphine (see s 33 of the mda read with the second

                    schedule thereto) was unconstitutional. pending the hearing of cm 41/2009,

                    the president, on the advice of the attorney-general, granted a temporary stay

                    of execution in respect of the death sentence imposed on the

                appellant.
4       at the hearing of cm 41/2009 on

                    8 december 2009, the court of appeal granted the appellant leave to proceed

                    with cca 13/2008 on the ground that his earlier decision to withdraw that

                    appeal was a nullity, given his mistaken belief as to his legal rights (see

                        yong vui kong v public prosecutor [2010]

                    2 slr 192). subsequently, cca 13/2008 was heard on 15 march 2010.

                    in his written submissions for that hearing, the then attorney-general stated

                        (inter alia) that under art 22p of the

                    singapore constitution (referred to hereafter as “art 22p”

                    for short), the president had no discretion in exercising the clemency power as

                    he had to act on the advice of the cabinet. the court of appeal reserved

                    judgment at the end of the hearing, and, on 14 may 2010, delivered its

                    decision dismissing cca 13/2008 (see yong vui kong v

                        public prosecutor and another matter [2010] 3 slr 489

                        (“yong vui kong

                    (no 2)”)).
5       on 10 may 2010, shortly before the court of

                    appeal’s decision on cca 13/2008 was released,

                    mr k shanmugam, the minister for law and the then second minister for

                    home affairs (“the law minister”), was reported in a local

                    newspaper, today, as having made, at a community

                    event the previous day, certain comments on the mandatory death penalty for

                    serious drug trafficking offences (these comments will be referred to hereafter

                    as “the law minister’s statements”). the material parts of

                    the law minister’s statements, as reported in the 10 may 2010 edition

                    of today, are set out below:[note: 1]

death penalty, a trade-off


saves ‘thousands of lives’ that may be

                            ruined if drugs freely available: minister

05:55 am may 10, 2010

singapore – the mandatory death penalty for serious drug offences

                        here is a “trade-off” the government makes to protect

                        “thousands of lives” that may be ruined if drugs were freely

                        available, law minister and second home affairs minister k shanmugam

                        said yesterday.

he was replying to a resident during a dialogue session

                            at siglap south community centre who asked if there would be changes on

                            this policy, in light of the case of [the appellant].
the 22-year-old successfully got a stay of execution from [the] high court

                        last december – despite the president rejecting his clemency plea

                        – after being sentenced to hang for trafficking 47g of heroin.
he had told the court during his trial [that] he was unaware of the

                        contents of the packages [he was carrying at the material time] as he was

                        merely following the instructions of his boss in johor bahru when he drove

                        into singapore to deliver them.
but mr shanmugam said “thousands of lives

                            have been ruined due to the free availability of

                        drugs” in cities such as sydney and new york. it also

                        contributes to soaring crime rates, he added.
“people assume you can have this safety and security without this

                        framework of the law; that you can change it, and yet your safety and

                        security will not be affected,” he said. “but there are always

                        trade-offs. the difficulty the government has sometimes in explaining this

                        is that the trade-offs are not apparent. the damage to a large number of

                        others is not obvious.

“you save one life here, but 10 other lives will

                            be gone. what will your choice be?”


if [the appellant] escapes the death penalty, drug

                            barons will think the signal is that young and vulnerable traffickers

                            will be spared and can be used as drug mules, argued

                            mr shanmugam.
“then you’ll get 10 more. there’ll be an unstoppable

                        stream of such people coming through as long as we say we won’t

                        enforce our laws,” he said during his ministerial community visit to

                        joo chiat.
…
[emphasis added]
6       in response to the law minister’s

                    statements, mr ravi declared that those statements had caused the

                    appellant’s fate to be “‘poisoned’ with

                        ‘biasedness’”.[note: 2]

                    mr ravi’s comments were reported in the 15 may 2010 edition of

                        today, which also elaborated on the law

                    minister’s statements and a press statement released by the ministry of

                    law in respect of those statements (“the minlaw press statement”),

                    as follows:[note: 3]

convict’s last chance to escape death …

                            president to hear clemency plea; lawyer takes issue with

                            minister’s remarks

05:55 am may 15, 2010
by teo xuanwei
singapore – his first clemency plea was unsuccessful and now

                        convicted drug mule yong vui kong’s [viz, the appellant’s] last chance to escape death lies in

                        the president’s hands, after the highest court in the land dismissed

                        his appeal.
…
but [the appellant]’s lawyer, mr m ravi, told reporters he

                        plans to file for a judicial review before the court of appeal over law

                        minister k shanmugam’s remarks relating to his client’s

                        case during a residents’ dialogue session last sunday in joo

                        chiat.

the resident had asked if [the appellant]’s case

                            would affect singapore’s laws on the mandatory death

                            penalty.
mr shanmugam replied: “[the appellant] (who

                            was sentenced to hang for trafficking in 47g of heroin) is young. but if

                            we say, ‘we let you go’, what’s the signal we’re

                            sending?
“we’re sending a signal to all drug barons out there: just

                        make sure you choose a victim who’s young or a mother of a young child

                        and use them as the people to carry drugs into singapore.”
with the sympathy generated after these people are caught, he added, there

                        will be “a whole unstoppable stream of people coming through as long

                        as we say we won’t enforce our laws”.
as [the appellant]’s case was subjudice, or still under judgment,

                        mr ravi said his client’s fate had been “poisoned”

                        with “biasedness”.
in reply to media queries, the ministry of law said: “the

                        government has made clear its policy and philosophy on having the mandatory

                        death penalty for a number of offences, such as drug trafficking.
“minister shanmugam, in response to a specific question

                        … reiterated the policy and philosophy behind the death penalty and

                        why singapore adopted a tough stance.”
…
[emphasis added]
7       following the above reports in today, the appellant commenced os 740/2010 pursuant

                    to o 53 of the rules of court (cap 322, r 5, 2006 rev ed) on

                    21 july 2010, naming the attorney-general as the respondent (“the

                    respondent”) and seeking the following orders:[note: 4]
1)that leave be

                            granted for [the] hearing of prayers 2–12 as set out

                            below:–
2)that under

                            article 22p of the constitution of the republic of singapore

                            [(1985 rev ed, 1999 reprint) (“the

                            constitution”)] it is the … president and not his advisors

                            who has the discretion to decide whether or not to grant the

                            [appellant]’s petition for clemency, this being a matter in

                            respect of which the president may decide in his discretion under

                            article 21(2) of the constitution, it being a function the

                            performance of which the president is authorised to act in his

                            discretion pursuant to articles 21(2)(i) and 22p of the

                            constitution[.]
3)that the

                            executive’s statements that “although in theory it is the

                            president who exercises the prerogative of mercy, in fact it is the

                            cabinet that makes the decision” and that “the president

                            does not have discretion [in] this matter” amount to a preemption

                            and usurpation of the decision making powers of the … president

                            under article 22p and jeopardise a fair and just determination of

                            the [appellant]’s clemency

                            petition[.]
4)that the …

                            president’s manifest acquiescence in the executive’s

                            position as aforesaid is ultra vires and in breach of the constitution

                            inasmuch as:
a.it amounts to an abdication by the …

                                president of his decision making powers under

                                article 22p;
b.it constitutes a breach of the maxim delegatus

                                non potest delegare inasmuch as the … president is delegating

                                to [the] cabinet the decision making powers delegated to him by the

                                constitution;
c.it amounts to an unlawful fettering by the

                                … president of his discretion to grant or refuse a petition

                                for clemency[;]
d.it subordinates the holder of the highest

                                office under the constitution to an inferior executive body under

                                the constitution[.]
5)that the president’s power, being a power of

                            high prerogative of mercy, is an executive act exercised with the

                            greatest conscience and care and without fear of influence from any

                            quarter. it is a real decision-making power and not a mere ceremonial

                            rubber stamp. it necessarily includes the power to decide to exercise

                            the discretion in a way which may differ from the advice of the

                            cabinet.
6)that the remarks of the law minister

                            mr k shanmugam on 9 may 2010 [ie, the law minister’s statements as defined at

                            [5] above] and of the ministry of law in its press release dated

                            9 july 2010 [ie, the minlaw press

                            statement as defined at [6] above] have created a reasonable

                            apprehension that the views there expressed represent those of [the]

                            cabinet and that any advice which [the] cabinet may give in this matter

                            has as a result already been predetermined prior to the receipt of the

                            [appellant]’s clemency petition and that accordingly the

                            [c]onstitutional process for handling the [appellant]’s clemency

                            petition has been irreversibly tainted to the prejudice of the

                            [appellant].
7)that the remarks of the law minister

                            mr k shanmugam on 9 may 2010 and of the ministry of law

                            in its press release dated 9 july 2010 have created a reasonable

                            apprehension that the views there expressed represent those of [the]

                            cabinet and that accordingly any advice which [the] cabinet may give in

                            this matter has already been predetermined prior to the sentence being

                            “confirmed by the appellate court” and before such reports

                            were transmitted to the cabinet for consideration as required under

                            article 22p of the constitution.
8)that in keeping with the strong public interest in

                            ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice, the cabinet

                            is disqualified by a reasonable apprehension of bias from taking further

                            part in the clemency process; inasmuch as a reasonable member of the

                            public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias by reason of

                            predetermination even though the court itself considers there is no real

                            danger of this on the facts.
9)that the [appellant] has been deprived of the

                            possibility of a fair determination of the clemency process and is

                            entitled not to be deprived of his life on account

                        thereof.
10)that the conduct of the minister of law

                            mr k shanmugam has irreversibly tainted the clemency process

                            with apparent bias, and that the [appellant] is entitled to be pardoned

                            on account thereof or is alternatively entitled not to be deprived of

                            his life.
11)the [appellant] is entitled to see all the

                            materials that will be before the cabinet on his clemency petition

                            including and in particular the trial judge’s report, the chief

                            justice’s report or other reports of the appellate court and the

                            attorney-general’s opinion so as to afford him an opportunity to

                            make written representations before any decision is reached. the

                            [appellant] relies on the decision of the judicial committee of the

                            privy council in neville lewis & others (2001)

                                2 ac 50, as to the requirements of natural justice

                            in a case such as this.
12)that the [appellant] has suffered grave injustice

                            as a result of the actions of the president and [the] cabinet and is

                            entitled not to be deprived of his life on account

                        thereof.

                    required under o 53 r 1(2) of the rules of court (“the

                    appellant’s o 53 statement”), the appellant stated that he was

                    seeking the following reliefs:[note: 5]
2.the reliefs

                            sought:–
a.that the [appellant] be granted leave to apply

                                for a [d]eclaratory judgment that it is the … president and

                                not his advisors who make the final determination of the

                                [appellant]’s petition for clemency.
b.that the [appellant] be granted leave to apply

                                for an order of prohibition enjoining the … president from

                                abdicating his authority under article 22p to the

                                cabinet.
c.that the … president be enjoined from

                                fettering his discretion to grant or refuse the [appellant]’s

                                petition of clemency.
d.that the [appellant] be granted an order of

                                prohibition to enjoin the director of prisons from executing the

                                [appellant] and that the [appellant] be granted an indefinite stay

                                of execution.
e.that the [appellant] has been deprived of the

                                possibility of a fair determination of the clemency process and is

                                entitled not to be deprived of his life on account

                            thereof.
f.that the conduct of the minister of law

                                mr k shanmugam has irreversibly tainted the clemency

                                process with apparent bias, and that the [appellant] is entitled to

                                be pardoned on account thereof or is alternatively entitled not to

                                be deprived of his life.
g.that the [appellant] has suffered grave

                                injustice as a result of the actions of the president and [the]

                                cabinet and is entitled not to be deprived of his life on account

                                thereof.
h.there is a distinction between the review of

                                the substantive decision whether or not to exercise discretion to

                                grant a pardon on the one hand and a review of the question whether

                                the decision to grant or not grant a pardon has been exercised by

                                the party empowered to decide the matter – the latter being a

                                reviewable jurisdictional issue. this application is not about

                                reviewing a decision on pardon but [is about] reviewing … a

                                failure to make a decision by the president; reviewing an abdication

                                of the decision making power; reviewing a fettering of discretion by

                                the president; reviewing a breach of the maxim delegatus non potest

                                delegare.
[underlining and emphasis in bold in original omitted]
9       in summary, in os 740/2010, the appellant

                    sought leave to be heard on his application for the grant of the following

                    substantive reliefs:
(a)     a declaratory order that under

                        art 22p, the clemency power was exercisable by the president acting in

                        his discretion, and not in accordance with the advice of the cabinet (see

                        para 2(a) of the appellant’s o 53

                    statement);
(b)     a

                        prohibitory order enjoining the president from delegating to the cabinet his

                        discretion to grant clemency (see paras 2(b) and 2(c) of the

                        appellant’s o 53 statement);
(c)     an indefinite stay of execution of the death

                        sentence imposed on him (see para 2(d) of the appellant’s

                        o 53 statement);
(d)     a declaratory order that clemency should be granted to him for the

                        reasons set out at paras 2(e)–2(g) of the appellant’s

                        o 53 statement; and
(e)     a declaratory order that he was entitled to disclosure of

                        the materials required to be sent to the cabinet under art 22p(2) of

                        the singapore constitution (referred to hereafter as “the

                        art 22p(2) materials” for short) in connection with his case

                        (see prayer 11 of os 740/2010).
the proceedings in the court below
10     the judge heard the appellant’s

                    application for leave together with his application for the substantive reliefs

                    listed in the preceding paragraph.
11     the appellant’s case before the judge

                    was basically as follows:
(a)     the clemency power under

                        art 22p was exercisable by the president acting in his discretion, and

                        not on (that is to say, not in accordance with) the advice of the cabinet.

                        hence, the president, in acting on the advice of the cabinet in this regard,

                        had wrongfully delegated his clemency power to the

                    cabinet.
(b)     the law

                        minister’s statements had given rise to a reasonable apprehension that

                        those statements represented not only the law minister’s view, but

                        also the view of the cabinet as a whole. this had in turn engendered

                        “a reasonable apprehension that … any advice which [the]

                        cabinet [might] give in [relation to the appellant’s case] ha[d]

                        already been predetermined”;[note: 6]ie, there was “a reasonable suspicion

                        of bias by reason of predetermination”.[note: 7] accordingly, the law

                        minister’s statements had “irreversibly tainted the clemency

                        process with apparent bias”.[note: 8] on this basis, the death

                        sentence imposed on the appellant could not possibly be executed “in

                        accordance with law” within the meaning of art 9(1) of the

                        singapore constitution, and, therefore, clemency must be granted to the

                        appellant.
(c)     the

                        appellant was entitled to disclosure of the art 22p(2) materials

                        relating to his case so that he could make adequate representations to the

                        cabinet before the cabinet decided what advice to give to the president

                            vis-à-vis whether clemency should be

                        granted to him.
12     the respondent’s case was basically that

                    the clemency power and/or its exercise (collectively referred to hereafter as

                    “the clemency power” for convenience) was not justiciable as the

                    clemency power was “an extra-legal, extra-judicial and extraordinary

                    [power] … that [was] only invoked when the legal process ha[d] reached

                    its final and ultimate conclusion”.[note: 9] consequently, it was

                    argued, the manner in which the president exercised the clemency power and the

                    decision which he made pursuant to that power would be outside the purview of

                    the courts.
13     the judge dismissed os 740/2010 after

                    carefully analysing in a reserved judgment (ie,

                    the hc judgment) the parties’ arguments on the facts and the law, as well

                    as case law from various common law jurisdictions on the clemency power. the

                    appellant then appealed to this court against the judge’s

                decision.
the issues on appeal
the appellant’s case
14     in his written case for this appeal, the

                    appellant listed his grounds of appeal under the following headings:[note: 10]
i.the power to

                            grant pardon under article 22p of the singapore constitution is not

                            immune to judicial review …
…
ii.the power to

                            pardon is susceptible to judicial review on the grounds that fair

                            procedure has not been observed …
…
iii.fair procedure

                            requires that the power to pardon be exercised in accordance with the

                            rule against apparent bias …
…
iv.the rule against

                            apparent bias is violated when there is an appearance of prejudgment

                            …
…
v.apparent bias by

                            prejudgment has arisen in the present case, and [the] cabinet is

                            therefore disqualified from taking any further part in the pardon

                            process …
…
vi.[the] cabinet

                            being disqualified, the pardon process can no longer be properly

                            proceeded with …
…
vii.the propriety

                            of the pardon process has been further compromised because it is the

                            president who should make the ultimate decision regarding pardon, and

                            not [the] cabinet …
…
viii.the propriety

                            of the pardon process will be further compromised if the materials

                            placed before [the] cabinet are not made available to the appellant

                            …
…
ix.the appellant

                            must not be excuted without the benefit of a properly conducted pardon

                            process …
…
x.whether declarations can be granted in actions

                            begun under order 53 …
[emphasis in bold in original omitted]
mr ravi elaborated on all of the above grounds of appeal in his

                    oral submissions before this court as well as in two “speaking

                    notes” which he tendered to the court at the hearing of the

                    appeal.
the respondent’s case
15     the respondent’s written case joined

                    issue with all of the appellant’s grounds of appeal, and crystallised them

                    into five legal issues as follows:
(a)     whether the clemency power under

                        art 22p is exercised by the president acting in his discretion or

                        whether the president is bound by the advice of the cabinet in this regard

                        (referred to hereafter as “the discretion

                    issue”);
(b)     whether, in our local context, the clemency power is subject to judicial

                        review (referred to hereafter as “the justiciability

                        issue”);
(c)     if the justiciability issue is answered in the affirmative, whether breach

                        of natural justice is an applicable ground for reviewing the process of

                        exercising the clemency power (“the clemency process”), and,

                        if it is, whether the clemency process vis-à-vis the appellant has been tainted by apparent bias in

                        the present case as a result of the law minister’s statements

                        (referred to hereafter as “the natural justice

                    issue”);
(d)     whether the appellant is entitled to disclosure of the art 22p(2)

                        materials relating to his case so that he can make adequate representations

                        to the president on any fresh clemency petition which he may wish to file

                        (referred to hereafter as “the disclosure issue”);

                    and
(e)     whether

                        declaratory relief can be granted in proceedings commenced under o 53

                        of the rules of court (referred to hereafter as “the declaratory

                        relief issue”).
the surprises which mr ravi sprang at the hearing of this

                appeal
the application for my recusal
16     at the commencement of the hearing of this

                    appeal, mr ravi sprang a surprise by making, without any prior notice to

                    either the court or the respondent, a preliminary application for me to recuse

                    myself from hearing the appeal on the ground of apparent bias. his reasons for

                    making the application, in his own words (as recorded in the court’s notes

                    taken at the hearing of the appeal), are set out in the following

                        passages:[note: 11]
apply to disqualify chief justice from the bench. ... asking cj to

                        disqualify himself from hearing the matter: he was the ag in 2006. your honours have a conflict of interest in this matter to the

                            extent that you were the ag advising the president. the

                        outcome of this application, in the event that [the] president does not have

                        powers, must be in conflict with the ca’s reasoning. yh [your honour]

                        becomes an interested member in the outcome of this application. because if

                        yh agrees that [the] president has clemency powers, then yh would be wrong

                        as well. i’m not saying that cj is prejudiced, i’m just going by

                        apparent bias. i am only basing my proposition on the rule of law, and the

                        fact that life is at stake. i will leave it to you, to make your own

                        judgment within the province and prerogative of the court.
…
straightforward point. cj was the ag who had advised the president, who

                        had no discretion in the matter. puts cj in conflict with

                            any reading of the [singapore] constitution which states that the

                            president does have power.
…
11 april 2006, the ag became the current cj. when cases which were

                        processed by him as ag come up to court, the cj doesn’t sit to hear

                        them. when [the appellant]’s case was heard as a criminal appeal, his

                        case was not processed when cj was ag. but the current application: the

                        current cj, being the ag before, if this court rules that [the] president

                        has clemency powers, the cj must have advised cabinet wrongly as ag, and

                        therefore advised the president wrongly. if so, then all the other

                        executions would have been carried out wrongly. there is a potential of

                        reasonable apprehension of bias.
…
… it’s not whether [your honour] must have advised –

                        the fact that the president assumed he had no power. either by way of negligence, omission, the advice was wrong.

                        i do not want to go outside and tell another story.

my proposition is bentley [ie, regina v secretary of state

                        it’s not that [your honour has] advised the president. i fortify my

                        position that in 2005, mr nathan [ie,

                        president s r nathan] … gave an interview to the

                        papers to say that he had no powers, it’s only the cabinet. this

                        article shows that the president himself says he didn’t have clemency

                        powers. as it stands, it must mean that the

                            [attorneys-general] have taken that view and given such advice to the

                            president.
[emphasis added]
mr ravi explained that his lateness in making his recusal

                    application, despite his having been informed of the coram two weeks before the

                    hearing of the appeal, was due to his foreign legal advisers having advised him

                    only two days before the hearing to raise the aforesaid arguments in the

                    interests of the appellant.
17     whatever reasons mr ravi might have for

                    the lateness of his recusal application, his objections to my hearing this

                    appeal were patently without merit. his objections were based on two premises,

                    none of which were tenable in the context of the present case.
18     the first premise is that i had, qua attorney-general, given advice to the president

                    which had a bearing on the discretion issue. mr ravi was unable to make

                    good this premise. when i asked him if he had any evidence for his assertion

                    that i had, during my tenure as attorney-general, given the president such

                    advice, he replied that his position was “not that you have advised the president”[note: 12] [emphasis added], but that, because

                    the president himself had said in an interview that he did not have any

                    discretion in exercising the clemency power, “it must mean that the

                    [attorneys-general] have taken that view and given such advice to the

                        president”.[note: 13]
19     the second premise is that if i had advised the president that he had no discretion in

                    exercising the clemency power, i would have been wrong in law, and this would

                    put me in “in conflict with any reading of the

                        [singapore] constitution which states that the president does have

                        power”.[note: 14]

                    however, the legal argument which underlies this premise –

                    viz, the argument that the president can act in

                    his own discretion in exercising the clemency power – is fundamentally

                    flawed. it is trite law that the head of state in a constitution based on the

                    westminster model, such as the singapore constitution, is a ceremonial head of

                    state who: (a) must act in accordance with the advice of the cabinet in the

                    discharge of his functions; and (b) has no discretionary powers except

                    those expressly conferred on him by the constitution. in our local context,

                    art 22p is not a provision which expressly confers discretionary powers on

                    the president. this point is conclusively demonstrated by my colleagues on this

                    bench, andrew phang boon leong and v k rajah jja, in their joint

                    judgment (see, specifically, [156]–[157] and

                        [178]–[180] below). reference may also be made to the following

                    judicial pronouncements and academic writings: lee mau seng v

                        minister for home affairs and another [1971?1973] slr(r) 135 (at

                        constitutional law (with documentary

                    1976); n madhavan nair v

                        government of malaysia [1975] 2 mlj 286 (at 289 and 292

                    (pelanduk publications, 1997) (at pp 67?68).
20     notably, with reference to the clemency power

                    specifically, the constitutional law principle outlined at [19] above was stated by the then prime minister

                    on 22 december 1965 (in his parliamentary speech at the second reading of

                    the republic of singapore independence bill 1965 (bill 43 of 1965), which

                    was subsequently enacted as the republic of singapore independence act 1965

                    (act 9 of 1965)) vis-à-vis the

                    president’s role in the clemency process (see [172]–[173] below).

                    mr ravi’s argument that the president has a discretion in exercising

                    the clemency power was rejected by the judge in a carefully reasoned judgment.

                    before this court, mr ravi made no attempt whatsoever to demonstrate why

                    (in his view) the judge was wrong, apart from baldly reiterating that the judge

                    was wrong.
21     in our legal order, no judge, in discharging

                    his functions, is free to disregard fundamental principles of law. the principle

                    that under the singapore constitution, the president must act on the advice of

                    the cabinet in all matters in the discharge of his functions, except where

                    discretion is expressly conferred on him, is one such fundamental principle of

                    constitutional law. this principle is set out in art 21(1) read with

                    art 21(2) of the singapore constitution, and has been part of our

                    constitutional order ever since singapore attained internal self-government in

                    1959.
22     it was clear to this court that mr ravi

                    postulated a completely unsustainable argument vis-à-vis the president’s exercise of the clemency power

                    – one that contradicts our constitutional history, the text of

                    arts 21 and 22p and existing case law – for no reason other than it

                    suited his purpose, whatever it was. for the foregoing reasons, this court

                    rejected mr ravi’s recusal application.
the late raising of an additional ground of appeal
23     in the course of his oral submissions before

                    this court on the appeal proper, mr ravi sprang another surprise when he

                    argued that, independent of the appellant’s rights under the singapore

                    constitution, the appellant had a legitimate expectation that the president

                    would act in his discretion, as opposed to on the cabinet’s advice, in

                    deciding whether or not the appellant should be granted clemency. nevertheless,

                    given the grave personal (from the appellant’s viewpoint) and

                    constitutional implications which the decision in this appeal will have, this

                    court permitted mr ravi to raise the argument notwithstanding his lateness

                    in presenting it as one of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. for

                    convenience, i shall hereafter refer to this issue as “the legitimate

                    expectation issue”.
my approach in this judgment
24     in this judgment, i shall not discuss in

                    detail all of the issues enumerated at [15]

                    above. i shall, instead, focus on the justiciability issue, the natural justice

                    issue, the disclosure issue and the declaratory relief issue. with respect to

                    the discretion issue and the legitimate expectation issue, i have read the

                    relevant portions of phang and rajah jja’s joint judgment (namely,

                        [151]-[187] below) which deal with these two issues

                    with great clarity, and i fully agree with the decision and the reasoning set

                    out therein.
the declaratory relief issue
25     i shall begin my analysis with the

                    discretionary relief issue since it can be given short shrift in view of

                    existing case law on the type of relief available in proceedings brought under

                    o 53 of the rules of court (see, eg,

                        chan hiang leng colin and others v minister for

                        information and the arts [1996] 1 slr(r) 294 at [5]–[6] and re application by dow jones (asia)

                        inc [1987] slr(r) 627 at [14]). the case authorities show clearly that declaratory relief

                    is not a remedy provided for under o 53 of the rules of court, and, thus,

                    the court has no power to grant such relief in

                    proceedings commenced under this order. mr ravi has not convinced us that

                    his argument to the contrary is correct.
the justiciability issue 
26     i turn next to the justiciability issue,

                        ie, the issue of whether or not, in our local

                    context, the clemency power under art 22p is amenable to judicial review.

                    this issue has not hitherto been considered by this court. in this regard, i

                    note that in jabar bin kadermastan v public

                        prosecutor [1995] 1 slr(r) 326, this court held, with

                    reference to the immediate predecessor of art 22p (viz, s 8 of the republic of singapore independence act 1965

                    (1985 rev ed)), that only the president had the power to commute or remit a

                    sentence, or to stay the execution of a sentence (see also the decision to the

                    same effect in lwee kwi ling mary v public

                        prosecutor [2003] 2 slr(r) 151). these two decisions are not

                    relevant to the justiciability issue since they concern the separation of the

                    executive power from the judicial power under the singapore constitution, and

                    not the reviewability or otherwise of executive decisions made in exercise of

                    the clemency power.
preliminary points
27     before i begin my analysis of the

                    justiciability issue, there are a number of preliminary points which i wish to

                    make. the first concerns the public policy underlying the clemency power (or the

                    pardon power, as it is also called), which originated from the prerogative of

                    mercy in england. in this regard, the following passages from two commentaries

                    on the clemency power under the us constitution are apposite. the first is from

                    the section on “pardon and parole” by john glenn et al in corpus juris secundum: a

                        complete restatement of the entire american law as developed by all reported

                        cases (west group, 2010), where the authors explain the relevant

                    public policy considerations as follows (at vol 67a, §11):
the pardoning power is founded on considerations of the public good, and

                        is to be exercised on the ground that the public welfare, which is the

                        legitimate object of all punishment, will be as well promoted by a

                        suspension as by an execution of the sentence. it may also be used to the

                        end that justice be done by correcting injustice, as where after-discovered

                        facts convince the official or board vested with the power that there was no

                        guilt or that other mistakes were made in the operation or enforcement of

                        the criminal law. executive clemency also exists to afford relief from undue

                        harshness or evident mistake in the operation or enforcement of the criminal

                        law.
the second commentary is from the section on “pardon and

                    parole” by anne m payne in american

                        jurisprudence (west group, 2nd ed, 2002), where the author

                    states (at vol 59, §11):
the granting of a pardon is an act of grace, bestowed by the government

                        through its duly authorized officers or department, and is designed to

                        relieve an individual from the unforeseen injustice, because of

                        extraordinary facts and circumstances peculiar to the case, of applying the

                        punishment provided in a general statute which, under ordinary

                        circumstances, is just and beneficial. however, a pardon is more than a mere

                        act of private grace proceeding from an individual having the power to

                        exercise it, and is a part of the constitutional scheme; properly granted,

                        it is also an act of justice, supported by a wise public policy.
28     my second preliminary point relates to the

                    meaning of the terms “justiciability” and

                    “reviewability” as used in the context of judicial review

                    proceedings. judges from common law jurisdictions have often discussed the

                    question of whether judicial review applies to the clemency power in terms of

                    the “justiciability” of this power by the courts, with the concept

                    of “justiciability” frequently used synonymously with the concept

                    of “reviewability”. i shall adopt the same approach in this

                    judgment. i shall also adopt the meaning of “justiciable” set out

                    in the oxford english dictionary (clarendon press,

                    2nd ed, 1989) at vol 8, p 327, ie,

                    “[l]iable to be tried in a court of justice; subject to

                    jurisdiction”.
29     my third preliminary point, which is likewise

                    a definitional one, concerns two expressions which are often used

                    interchangeably in discussions on the clemency power –

                    viz, “clemency power” and

                    “clemency process”. indeed, in the present case, the judge

                    expressly stated that he was treating these two terms as synonyms (see [22] of the hc judgment). thus, he set out his

                    ruling on the justiciability issue as follows in the hc judgment:
67    for the reasons

                            which follow, i am … of the view that article 22p is not justiciable on the grounds

                            raised by mr ravi, viz:
(a)    that it is the president, and not the cabinet,

                                who should exercise the power to grant pardons;
(b)    that the clemency process is tainted because

                                the cabinet has pre-judged [the appellant]’s case, as

                                evidenced by the [law] minister’s statement[s];

                            and
(c)    that [the appellant] has a right to see the

                                materials before the cabinet.
…
85    in summary, the

                                clemency process is not justiciable on

                            the grounds pursued by [the appellant], because:
(a)    the power to grant pardons under

                                article 22p is exercised by the cabinet, and not the president,

                                who has no discretion in the matter;
(b)    apparent bias is not an available ground on

                                which to review the clemency process;
(c)    there is no evidence of a pre-determination of

                                [the appellant]’s imminent [clemency] petition;

                            and
(d)    there is no basis for a substantive right to

                                the materials which will be before the cabinet when it advises the

                                president on the clemency petition.
[emphasis added]
in effect, at [67] of the hc

                    judgment, the judge said that “article 22p” –

                    ie, the clemency power – was not justiciable, whilst at [85] thereof, he said that the clemency

                        process was not justiciable.
30     unlike the judge, i shall not be treating the

                    terms “clemency power” and “clemency process” as

                    synonyms in this judgment. instead, as indicated earlier, i shall use the

                    expression “the clemency power” to denote the clemency power

                        and/or its exercise where the context so

                    requires (see [12] above), and the

                    expression “the clemency process” to denote the process of

                    exercising the clemency power (see sub-para (c) of [15] above). admittedly, the distinction between the exercise of

                    the clemency power and the process of exercising that power (ie, the clemency process) is a fine one, and, arguably, the

                    distinction may not even exist at all in certain contexts (eg, the manner in which the clemency power is exercised can be

                    regarded either as an aspect of the clemency process or as an aspect of the clemency power, as defined to include (where appropriate) the exercise of

                    this power). be that as it may, i think it is worthwhile to make this

                    distinction as it is, in my view, more appropriate to use the expression

                    “the clemency process”, as opposed to “the clemency

                    power”, in discussing the natural justice issue.
the range of matters which are justiciable by the courts
31     the justiciability issue can be seen as a

                    subset of the broader question of whether there are any matters which are

                    non-justiciable, ie, which the courts do not have

                    jurisdiction to rule on. where singapore is concerned, i am of the view that by

                    virtue of the judicial power vested in the supreme court under art 93 of

                    the singapore constitution, the supreme court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on

                    every legal dispute on a subject matter in respect of which parliament has

                    conferred jurisdiction on it, including any constitutional dispute between the

                    state and an individual. in any modern state whose fundamental law is a written

                    constitution based on the doctrine of separation of powers (ie, where the judicial power is vested in an independent

                    judiciary), there will (or should) be few, if any, legal disputes between the

                    state and the people from which the judicial power is excluded. in this regard,

                    the following comment by melville fuller weston in his article “political

                    questions” (1924–1925) 38 harv l rev 296

                    (“weston’s article”) is pertinent (at p 299):
the word “justiciable” … is legitimately capable of

                        denoting almost any question. that is to say, the questions are few which

                        are intrinsically incapable of submission to … an adjudication from

                        which practical consequences in human conduct are to follow.
32     the matters which are “intrinsically

                    incapable of submission to … an adjudication” (per weston’s article at p 299) may vary greatly in

                    different legal contexts. for instance, in chandler and

                        others v director of public prosecutions [1964] ac 763

                        (“chandler”),

                    viscount radcliffe expressed the view that the question of whether it was

                    in the interests of the uk to acquire, retain or house nuclear armaments was

                    “not … a matter for judge or jury” (at 799) because it

                    involved “an infinity of considerations, military and diplomatic,

                    technical, psychological and moral” (at 799) which were not within the

                    province of the courts to assess. in contrast, the converse position was taken

                    in operation dismantle inc and others v her majesty the

                        queen [1985] 1 scr 441 (“operation

                        dismantle”), where the supreme court of canada held that

                    the courts could adjudicate on the issue of whether or not the canadian

                    government’s decision to allow the us to test cruise missiles in canada

                    violated s 7 of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms (“the

                    canadian charter”), which sets out “the right to life, liberty and

                    security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in

                    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice”.
whether the clemency power is justiciable in our local

                context
the parties’ arguments
33     mr ravi’s argument vis-à-vis the justiciability issue in the present appeal

                    is that the clemency power under art 22p is justiciable, given the

                    principle of legality laid down by this court in chng suan

                        tze v minister for home affairs and others and other appeals

                    [1988] 2 slr(r) 525 (“chng suan

                    tze”) –

                    ie, the principle that “[a]ll power has

                    legal limits” (at [86]). he

                    argues that in view of this principle (referred to hereafter as “the

                        chng suan tze principle”), the clemency

                    power is likewise subject to judicial review if the person or body of persons on

                    whom this power is conferred (“the ultimate authority”) has acted

                    illegally or outside the scope of the power, or has made a decision (pursuant to

                    the power) which is tainted by a reasonable apprehension of bias.
34     the respondent does not take the position that

                        chng suan tze was wrongly decided (ie, he accepts the chng suan

                        tze principle). rather, his position is that:
(a)     because of the doctrine of

                        separation of powers which underlies singapore’s constitutional

                        framework, “there are clearly provinces of executive decision-making

                        that are, and should be, immune from judicial review” (see lee hsien loong v review publishing co ltd and another and

                            another suit [2007] 2 slr(r) 453 at [95]).
(b)     the clemency power is one area of executive

                        power which is (or should be) non-justiciable.
(c)     if, however, the clemency power is indeed

                        justiciable, then its justiciability should be limited to a determination of

                        whether or not a particular clemency decision (ie, a particular decision as to: (i) whether or not to

                        grant clemency; and (ii) if clemency is to be granted, the form and/or

                        extent of clemency to be granted) was made in accordance with art 22p,

                        and should extend no further.
35     to elaborate on the respondent’s

                    position, its central premise is that the clemency power, howsoever exercised,

                    is non-justiciable. in support of this proposition, the respondent highlighted

                    several factors. the first is the breadth of the power conferred by

                    art 22p. this article does not spell out any limits on the scope of the

                    clemency power or how it may be exercised, except for the procedure applicable

                    in what i shall hereafter refer to as a “death sentence case”,

                        ie, a case involving an offender who has been

                    sentenced to death and who has (assuming he appeals against his conviction

                    and/or his sentence) exhausted all his rights of appeal. the second factor

                    emphasised by the respondent is that a clemency decision is based purely on

                    policy considerations. the third factor which the respondent pointed out is that

                    the clemency power in art 22p is derived from the prerogative of mercy.

                    since mercy “begins where legal rights end” (to use

                    lord diplock’s famous aphorism in michael de

                        freitas also called michael abdul malik v george ramoutar benny and

                        others [1976] ac 239 (“de

                        freitas”) at 247), the grant of mercy, so the respondent

                    submits, is not the subject of legal rights and, therefore, is not amenable to

                    judicial review.
36     in order to evaluate the opposing views of

                    mr ravi and the respondent respectively on the justiciability issue, it is

                    helpful to consider case law from and the constitutional history of england as

                    well as those former british colonies and dominions which have a legal heritage

                    similar to ours. since singapore was formerly a british colony, with the

                    clemency power previously exercisable by the governor of singapore (and,

                    subsequently, the yang di-pertuan negara) in the name and on behalf of the

                    british sovereign (see further [160]–[168] below),

                    it is only appropriate that i begin by reviewing the english position on the

                    justiciability of the clemency power.
justiciability of the clemency power in england and former british

                colonies 
(1)   the position in england
37     the traditional approach in england vis-à-vis the justiciability of the clemency power was

                    reiterated in 1971 by the english court of appeal in hanratty

                        and another v lord butler of saffron walden (1971)

                    115 sj 386 (“hanratty”),

                    namely, “[t]he law would not inquire into the manner in which [the]

                    prerogative [of mercy] was exercised” (at 386) –

                    ie, the clemency power was not reviewable by the

                    courts. lord denning mr (with whom salmon and stamp ljj agreed)

                    explained that this approach was grounded on public policy. the english

                    courts’ traditional reluctance to encroach on the prerogative of mercy

                    stems from the fact that in england, this power has been exercised by the

                    sovereign from time immemorial, and has always been regarded as an essential

                    attribute of sovereignty. this traditional approach persisted even long after

                    constitutional government had taken root in england, and even after prerogative

                    powers, including the prerogative of mercy, became exercisable by the executive

                    instead of by the british sovereign.
38     in 1985, a significant inroad into the

                    non-justiciability of prerogative powers in general was made by the house of

                    lords in its seminal decision in council of civil service

                        unions and others v minister for the civil service [1985] ac 374

                        (“gchq”). in that case, three of

                    the law lords (viz, lord scarman,

                    lord diplock and lord roskill) held that it was no longer

                    constitutionally appropriate to deny the courts supervisory jurisdiction over a

                    governmental decision merely because the legal authority for that decision

                    stemmed from a prerogative power rather than a statutory power (the other two

                    law lords, viz, lord fraser of tullybelton

                    and lord brightman, preferred to leave this point open, although they

                    agreed with their fellow law lords that, on the facts of the case, the

                    governmental decision in question was not illegal).
39     at 407 of gchq,

                    lord scarman stated:
… [t]he law relating to judicial review has now reached the stage

                        where … if the subject matter in respect of which [the] prerogative

                        power [in question] is exercised is justiciable, that is to say[,] if it is

                        a matter upon which the court can adjudicate, the exercise of the power is

                        subject to review in accordance with the principles developed in respect of

                        the review of the exercise of statutory power. …

                        today, therefore, the controlling factor in determining

                            whether the exercise of prerogative power is subject to judicial review

                            is not its source but its subject matter. [emphasis

                        added]
in essence, what lord scarman said in the above passage was that

                    the justiciability of an executive power depended not on the source of the

                    executive power in question (ie, the fact that the

                    executive power was derived from the royal prerogative did not automatically

                    render its exercise immune from judicial review), but on the subject matter in

                    respect of which the executive power was exercised, with the decisive factor

                    being whether that subject matter was one which, either as a matter of law or as

                    a matter of fact, the courts could not adjudicate on.
40     notwithstanding the change in judicial

                    attitude expressed by lord scarman, lord diplock and lord roskill

                    in gchq apropos the justiciability of prerogative

                    powers, it appears that the prerogative of mercy specifically remained immune

                    from judicial review after gchq since that case

                    did not concern that particular prerogative power (it concerned, instead, the

                    prerogative power to make orders regulating the conditions of service of staff

                    employed by the uk civil service). further, lord roskill (albeit alone

                    among the law lords) expressed the view (at 418) that the prerogative of mercy

                    was one of the prerogative powers which should remain non-justiciable (the

                    others being, in his lordship’s view, the prerogative powers relating to,

                    respectively, the making of treaties, the defence of the realm, the grant of

                    honours, the dissolution of parliament and the appointment of

                ministers).
41     the break from the traditional view (expressed

                    in, inter alia, hanratty) that there could be no judicial review of the clemency

                    power came in 1994 with the ruling of the divisional court in regina v secretary of state for the home department, ex parte

                        bentley [1994] qb 349 (“bentley”). that case concerned the execution in 1953 of a

                    19-year-old murderer (“bentley”). the then home secretary had

                    refused to grant bentley a reprieve from the death sentence even though the jury

                    at the trial had, after returning its verdict of guilty, recommended mercy for

                    bentley. in 1992, the home secretary rejected a petition by bentley’s

                    sister for bentley to be granted a posthumous free pardon (under english law,

                    the grant of a free pardon serves to “remove from the subject of the

                    pardon … ‘all pains[,] penalties and punishments whatsoever that

                    from the said conviction may ensue,’ but not … eliminate the

                    conviction itself” (see regina v foster

                    [1985] qb 115 at 130)). his reasons were that: (a) he could not substitute

                    his judgment for the judgment of the then home secretary in 1953; and

                    (b) it was the home office’s established policy not to grant a free

                    pardon to an offender unless the home secretary was satisfied that the offender

                    was both morally and technically innocent of any crime.
42     bentley’s sister applied for judicial

                    review of the home secretary’s decision on the ground that, inter alia, the home secretary had failed to recognise

                    that the prerogative of mercy was capable of being exercised in many different

                    circumstances and over a wide range, and had therefore failed to consider the

                    form of pardon which would be appropriate in bentley’s case. a preliminary

                    question arose before the divisional court as to whether the prerogative of

                    mercy was reviewable on the facts before the

                    court. the court declined to follow hanratty on the basis that it had been decided before gchq, and answered the preliminary question in the

                    affirmative, as follows (see bentley at

                    362–363 per watkins lj):
[counsel for bentley’s sister] … argues that the prerogative

                        of mercy is exercised by the home secretary on behalf of us all. it is an

                        important feature of our criminal justice system. it would be surprising and

                        regrettable in our developed state of public law were the decision of the

                        home secretary to be immune from legal challenge irrespective of the gravity

                        of the legal errors which infected such a decision. many types of decisions

                        made by the home secretary do involve an element of policy (e.g. parole) but

                        are subject to review.
we accept these arguments. [gchq] made it

                        clear that the powers of the court cannot be ousted merely by invoking the

                        word “prerogative.”

                        the question is simply whether the nature and subject

                            matter of the decision is amenable to the judicial process. are the

                            courts qualified to deal with the matter or does the decision involve

                            such questions of policy that they should not intrude because they are

                            ill-equipped to do so? looked at in this way[,] there must be cases in

                            which the exercise of the [r]oyal [p]rerogative is

                        reviewable, in our judgment. if, for example, it was clear that

                        the home secretary had refused to pardon someone solely on the grounds of

                        their sex, race or religion, the courts would be expected to interfere and,

                        in our judgment, would be entitled to do.

we conclude therefore that some aspects of the exercise

                            of the [r]oyal [p]rerogative are amenable to the judicial process. we do

                            not think that it is necessary for us to say more than this in the

                            instant case. it will be for other courts to decide on a case by case

                            basis whether the matter in question is reviewable or

                        not.
[emphasis added]
the divisional court noted lord roskill’s comment in

                        gchq that the clemency power should remain

                    immune from judicial review, but regarded it as obiter (see bentley at

                    363).
43     on the facts before it, the divisional court

                    found that the home secretary had not given sufficient consideration to his

                    power to grant some form of pardon which would be suitable to the particular

                    circumstances of the case, other than a free pardon. it did not, however,

                    declare the home secretary’s decision null and void, but merely invited

                    him to (see bentley at 365):
… look at the matter again and … examine whether it would be

                        just to exercise the prerogative of mercy in such a way as to give full

                        recognition to the now generally accepted view that [bentley] should have

                        been reprieved.
44     in my view, bentley clearly decided that the prerogative of mercy would be

                    reviewable if it were exercised based on an error of law (in that case, the home

                    secretary’s misconstruction of the type of pardon which the home office

                    could grant), or based on arbitrary and/or extraneous considerations. in other

                    words, the divisional court held that, depending on the facts of the case at

                    hand, it was possible that the prerogative of mercy would be subject to judicial

                    review like any other executive power, whether derived from a statutory source

                    or a prerogative source. however, the divisional court also affirmed the

                    long-established administrative law principle that the courts could not review

                    the merits of the home secretary’s decision

                    as to whether or not to grant clemency in a particular case.
(2)   the position in the caribbean states
45     the current legal position in the caribbean

                    states on the justiciability of the clemency power is that set out by the privy

                    council in neville lewis v attorney general of jamaica and

                        another [2001] 2 ac 50 (“lewis”). in that case, the privy council declined to

                    follow two of its own decisions, viz, de freitas, an appeal from trinidad and tobago, and

                        thomas reckley v minister of public safety and

                        immigration and others (no 2) [1996] ac 527

                        (“reckley”), an appeal from the

                    bahamas, both of which held that, under the law of the jurisdiction concerned,

                    the clemency power was not amenable to judicial review.
46     in de freitas,

                    the offender in question (“mf”) was a convicted murderer who had

                    been sentenced to death. under the constitution of trinidad and tobago, the

                    prerogative of mercy is exercisable by the governor-general on the advice of the

                    designated minister. in a death sentence case, the trial judge’s report

                    and such other information as the designated minister may require must be placed

                    before the advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy. the designated

                    minister must consult the advisory committee

                    before he advises the governor-general, but is not obliged to follow its

                    advice.
47     mf, after exhausting all his rights of appeal,

                    commenced an action in the high court of trinidad and tobago seeking a

                    declaration that the execution of the death sentence imposed on him would

                    violate his human rights and fundamental freedoms under the constitution of

                    trinidad and tobago. one of the arguments which mf made was that the functions

                    of the advisory committee were quasi-judicial in nature and thus had to be

                    performed in accordance with the rules of natural justice. this meant, mf

                    contended, that whenever the advisory committee met to consider what advice to

                    give to the designated minister vis-à-vis the

                    prerogative of mercy in a death sentence case, the offender in question was

                    entitled to be shown the materials placed before the advisory committee, and was

                    also entitled to be legally represented and heard at a hearing before the

                    advisory committee.
48     the privy council unanimously rejected

                    mf’s argument. lord diplock said (at 247–248):
except in so far as it may have been altered by the constitution [of

                        trinidad and tobago,] the legal nature of the exercise of the royal

                        prerogative of mercy in trinidad and tobago remains the same as it was in

                        england at common law. at common law this has always been

                            a matter which lies solely in the discretion of the sovereign, who by

                            constitutional convention exercises it in respect of england on the

                            advice of the home secretary to whom her majesty delegates her

                            discretion. mercy is not the subject of legal rights. it begins where

                            legal rights end. a convicted person has no legal right even to have his

                            case considered by the home secretary in connection with the exercise of

                            the prerogative of mercy. in tendering his advice to the sovereign the

                            home secretary is doing something that is often cited as the exemplar of

                            a purely discretionary act as contrasted with the exercise of a

                            quasi-judicial function. while capital punishment was still a

                        lawful penalty for murder in england it was the practice of the home

                        secretary in every capital case to call for a report of the case from the

                        trial judge and for such other information from such other sources as he

                        thought might help him to make up his mind as to the advice that he would

                        tender to the sovereign in the particular case. but it was never the

                        practice for the judge’s report or any other information obtained by

                        the home secretary to be disclosed to the condemned person or his legal

                        representatives.
section 70(1) of the constitution [of trinidad and tobago] makes it

                        clear that the prerogative of mercy in trinidad and tobago is of the same

                        legal nature as the royal prerogative of mercy in england. it is exercised

                        by the governor-general but “in her majesty’s name and on her

                        majesty’s behalf.” by section 70(2) the governor-general

                        is required to exercise this prerogative on the advice of a minister

                        designated by him … this provision does no more than spell out a

                        similar relationship between the designated minister and the

                        governor-general acting on behalf of her majesty to that which exists

                        between the home secretary and her majesty in england under an unwritten

                        convention of the british constitution. it serves to emphasise the personal

                        nature of the discretion exercised by the designated minister in tendering

                        his advice. the only novel feature is the provision in section 72(1)

                        and (2) that the [designated] minister before tendering his advice must, in

                        a case where an offender has been sentenced to death, and may, in other

                        cases, consult with the advisory committee established under

                        section 71, of which the [designated] minister himself is chairman; but

                        section 72(3) expressly provides that he is not obliged in any case to

                        act in accordance with their advice. in capital cases the advisory committee

                        too must see the judge’s report and any other information that the

                        [designated] minister has required to be obtained in connection with the

                        case, but it still remains a purely consultative body without any

                        decision-making power.

in their lordships’ view these provisions are not

                            capable of converting the functions of the [designated] minister, in

                            relation to the advice he tenders to the governor-general, from

                            functions which in their nature are purely discretionary into functions

                            that are in any sense quasi-judicial. this being so [an

                        offender in a death sentence case] has no legal right to have disclosed to

                        him any material furnished to the [designated] minister and the advisory

                        committee when they are exercising their respective functions under

                        sections 70 to 72 of the constitution [of trinidad and tobago].
[emphasis added]
49     some twenty years later, in 1996, the privy

                    council reviewed its approach in de freitas and

                    affirmed it in reckley, an appeal from the

                    bahamas. the clemency regime in that jurisdiction is similar to the clemency

                    regime in trinidad and tobago, in that: (a) the prerogative of mercy is

                    exercised by the governor-general on the advice of the designated minister; and

                    (b) in a death sentence case, the designated minister must place before the

                    advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy the trial judge’s report of

                    the case and such other information as he (the designated minister) may require.

                    however, unlike the position in trinidad and tobago, in a death sentence case in

                    the bahamas, the designated minister is not

                    required to consult the advisory committee before he advises the

                    governor-general on whether or not mercy should be granted to the offender

                    concerned. the designated minister may consult the advisory committee if he

                    wishes, but even if he does do so, he is not obliged to accept its

                    advice.
50     in reckley, the

                    offender in question (“tr”) was convicted of murder and sentenced

                    to death. his clemency petition to the designated minister was rejected without

                    his being given the opportunity to see and comment on the trial judge’s

                    report and the other materials placed before the advisory committee. tr filed a

                    constitutional motion alleging that his constitutional rights would be violated

                    if he were executed without his having the opportunity to see those materials

                    and make representations to the advisory committee.
51     the privy council applied the principle laid

                    down in de freitas and rejected tr’s

                    argument. lord goff of chieveley, delivering the privy council’s

                    judgment, said that the observations of lord diplock in de freitas were apposite to the corresponding provisions of the

                    bahamian constitution. at 539–540 of reckley, lord goff said:
it is of some interest to observe that articles 90 to 92

                        of the present bahamian constitution first appeared in the constitution of

                        1963, which came into force at a time before capital punishment was

                        abolished in great britain in 1965. at that time, there can be no doubt that

                        the status of the home secretary’s discretion in death sentence cases

                        in england was as described by lord diplock [in de

                            freitas]; and it appears that the statutory intention, when

                        enacting articles 90 to 92 of the bahamian constitution of 1963, was to

                        replicate that discretion, save that the designated minister was to be

                        provided with the benefit of advice from an advisory committee. it was

                        recognised by lord diplock in abbott v.

                            attorney-general of trinidad and tobago [1979] 1 w.l.r.

                        1342, 1346, that section 89 of the constitution of trinidad and tobago

                        (identical to article 92 of the bahamian constitution) imposes duties

                        upon the designated minister and the advisory committee arising under public

                        law; and further that no warrant of execution should be issued[:]
“until after the advisory committee has considered the case and

                            proffered its advice to the designated minister and the designated

                            minister has tendered his own advice (which may differ from that of the

                            advisory committee) to the president” – in [t]he bahamas,

                            to the governor-general.
even so, their lordships consider that the introduction

                            of the advisory committee, and the statutory provisions governing the

                            exercise of its functions in death sentence cases, reinforce

                            lord diplock’s analysis in de freitas … [at] 247–248. first of all, it is

                        made plain that every death sentence case must be considered by the advisory

                        committee. there is no question of such consideration depending on any

                        initiative from the condemned man or his advisers. second, despite the

                        obvious intention that the advisory committee shall be a group of

                        distinguished citizens, and despite the fact that the [designated] minister

                        is bound to consult with them in death sentence cases, he is not bound to

                        accept their advice. this provides a strong indication of an intention to preserve the status of the [designated]

                            minister’s discretion as a purely personal discretion,

                        while ensuring that he receives the benefit of advice from a reputable and

                        impartial source. indeed it may be inferred that the reason why provision

                        was made in the [bahamian] constitution for an advisory committee was to

                        provide a constitutional safeguard in circumstances where the [designated]

                        minister’s discretionary power was of such a nature that it was not

                        subject to judicial review. third, the material which has to be taken into

                        consideration at the meeting of the advisory committee is, apart from the

                        trial judge’s report, “such other information derived from the

                        record of the case or elsewhere as the minister may require.” this

                        provision, which is consistent with the practice formerly applicable in

                        england in the consideration of death sentence cases by the home secretary,

                        is inconsistent with the condemned man having a right to make

                        representations to the advisory committee.
the point can be placed in a broader context. a man accused of a capital

                        offence in [t]he bahamas has of course his legal rights. in particular he is

                        entitled to the benefit of a trial before a judge and jury, with all the

                        rights which that entails. after conviction and sentence, he has a right to

                        appeal to the [bahamian] court of appeal and, if his appeal is unsuccessful,

                        to petition for leave to appeal to the privy council. after his rights of

                        appeal are exhausted, he may still be able to invoke his fundamental rights

                        under the [bahamian] constitution. for a man is still entitled to his

                        fundamental rights, and in particular to his right to the protection of the

                        law, even after he has been sentenced to death. if therefore it is proposed

                        to execute him contrary to the law, for example because there has been such

                        delay that to execute him would constitute inhuman or degrading punishment,

                        or because there has been a failure to consult the advisory committee on the

                        prerogative of mercy as required by the [bahamian] constitution, then he can

                        apply to the [bahamian] supreme court for redress under article 28 of

                        the [bahamian] constitution. but the actual exercise by

                            the designated minister of his discretion in death sentence cases is

                            different. it is concerned with a regime, automatically applicable,

                            under which the designated minister, having consulted with the advisory

                            committee, decides, in the exercise of his own personal discretion,

                            whether to advise the governor-general that the law should or should not

                            take its course. of its very nature the [designated] minister’s

                            discretion, if exercised in favour of the condemned man, will involve a

                            departure from the law. such a decision is taken as an act of mercy or,

                            as it used to be said, as an act of grace. as lord diplock said

                            in de freitas … [at] 247g:

                            “mercy is not the subject of legal rights. it begins where legal

                            rights end.” and the act of the advisory committee in advising

                            the [designated] minister is of the same character as the act of the

                            [designated] minister in advising the

                        governor-general.
[emphasis added]
52     approximately five years later, in 2000, in

                        lewis, an appeal from jamaica, the majority of

                    the privy council (namely, lord slynn of hadley, lord nicholls of

                    birkenhead, lord steyn and lord hutton (collectively referred to

                    hereafter as “the majority in lewis”)) departed from the earlier approach taken in

                        de freitas and reckley. the material facts of lewis, which involved six offenders who had been convicted of

                    murder and sentenced to death (“the applicants in lewis”), are, in simplified form, as

                follows.
53     under s 90 of the jamaican constitution,

                    the governor-general, acting on the advice of the jamaican privy council

                    (“the jpc”), may grant clemency to an offender in a death sentence

                    case. in this regard, the governor-general must forward to the jpc the trial

                    judge’s written report of the case and such other information as he (the

                    governor-general) may require so that the jpc may advise him on whether or not

                    mercy should be granted to the offender concerned.
54     the applicants in lewis, after exhausting all their domestic avenues for reprieve

                    from the death sentences imposed on them, applied to the united nations human

                    rights committee (“the unhrc”) and the inter-american commission

                    on human rights (“the iachr”) alleging breach of their human

                    rights. pending the decision of these two international human rights bodies, the

                    jpc considered the clemency petitions of all the applicants in lewis without their knowledge, without their seeing the

                    materials before the jpc and without their making representations to the jpc.

                    acting on the jpc’s advice, the governor-general declined to grant

                    clemency to all the applicants in lewis, who then

                    brought judicial review proceedings to challenge the governor-general’s

                    decision on the basis that their constitutional right to the protection of the

                    law had been violated since they had been denied natural justice by the jpc when

                    it considered their clemency petitions.
55     the majority in lewis (lord hoffmann dissenting) ruled in favour of the

                    applicants in lewis, holding that:
(a)     although there was no legal right to

                        mercy, and although the merits of a decision of the governor-general (acting

                        on the jpc’s advice) made pursuant to the prerogative of mercy were

                        not reviewable by the courts, the prerogative of mercy should nonetheless,

                        in the light of jamaica’s international obligations, be exercised

                        pursuant to “procedures which [were] fair and proper and to that end

                        … subject to judicial review” (per lord slynn at 79).
(b)     in considering what natural justice required, it

                        was relevant to have regard to international human rights norms laid down in

                        treaties to which jamaica was a party, regardless of whether or not the

                        provisions of those treaties were independently enforceable under

                        jamaica’s domestic law.
(c)     in a death sentence case:
(i)       the offender was entitled

                            to have sufficient notice of the date on which the jpc would consider

                            his case so that he or his legal advisers could prepare representations.

                            the jpc was bound to consider such representations before deciding what

                            recommendation to give to the governor-general vis-à-vis whether or not clemency should be granted to

                            the offender.
(ii)       when a report by an international human rights

                            body was available, the jpc should consider it and should give an

                            explanation if it did not accept the recommendations in the

                            report.
(iii)       the offender should normally be given a copy of all the documents

                            available to the jpc, and not merely the gist of those

                        documents.
(d)     the defects in the procedure adopted in relation to the clemency

                        petitions of the applicants in lewis had

                        resulted in a breach of the rules of fairness and natural justice.

                        accordingly, the applicants in lewis had been

                        deprived of the protection of the law which they were entitled to either

                        under s 13(a) of the jamaican constitution (which provides that every

                        person in jamaica is entitled to, inter alia,

                        “the protection of the law”) or at common

                law.
56     lord hoffmann issued a strong dissent in

                        lewis, stating (at 87–89):
there are three questions which arise. the first (“the jamaican

                        privy council issue”) is whether the [jpc], before deciding whether

                        or not to recommend to the governor[-]general that a sentence of death be

                        commuted, is required to disclose to the prisoner the information which it

                        has received pursuant to section 91 of the [jamaican] constitution. the

                        second (“the inter-american commission issue”) is whether it

                        would be unlawful to execute a sentence of death while the prisoner’s

                        petition remained under consideration by the [iachr]. … [the third

                        question set out by lord hoffmann is not relevant to the present appeal

                        and has thus been omitted from this quote.]
all … these questions have been considered and answered in recent

                        decisions of the board. the jamaican privy council issue was decided in the

                        negative in reckley …, when the board

                        decided not to depart from its earlier decision in de

                            freitas … the inter-american commission issue was

                        decided in the negative in fisher v minister of public

                            safety and immigration (no 2) [2000] 1 ac 434 and

                        most recently in higgs v minister of national

                            security [2000] 2 ac 228. …
the board now proposes to depart from its recent decisions on all [of the

                        above] points. i do not think that there is any

                            justification for doing so. it was appropriate in reckley … for the board to review its

                        previous decision in de freitas …

                        twenty years had passed, during which there had been important developments

                        in administrative law. in particular, the notion once entertained that an

                        exercise of the prerogative was, as such, immune from judicial review had

                        been repudiated by the house of lords in [gchq]. it was arguable that the reluctance of the courts to

                        impose a general rule of audi alterem partem upon the exercise of the

                        prerogative of mercy was a mere relic of outdated theory. but the board

                        decided in …

                        reckley … that there were still, in

                        modern conditions, strong enough grounds for maintaining the old rule. in

                            burt v governor general [1992] 3 nzlr

                        672 cooke p similarly decided that although there were no conceptual

                        obstacles to requiring the governor[-]general to observe the principle of

                        audi alterem partem in exercising the prerogative of mercy, pragmatic

                        considerations in new zealand pointed the other way. the board in …

                        reckley … took the same view of

                        conditions in the caribbean in 1996. nothing has happened since then which

                        could justify revisiting the decision not to depart from de freitas …
on the inter-american commission issue, the majority have found in the

                        ancient concept of due process of law a philosopher’s stone undetected

                        by generations of judges which can convert the base metal of executive

                        action into the gold of legislative power. it does not however explain how

                        the trick is done. fisher v minister of public safety and

                            immigration (no 2) [2000] 1 ac 434 and higgs v minister of national security [2000]

                        2 ac 228 are overruled but the arguments stated succinctly in the

                        former and more elaborately in the latter are brushed aside rather than

                        confronted. in particular, there is no explanation of how, in the domestic

                        law of jamaica, the proceedings before the [iachr] constitute a legal

                        process (as opposed to the proceedings of any other non-governmental body)

                        which must be duly completed. nor can there be any question of the

                        [applicants in lewis] having a legitimate

                        expectation (as that term is understood in administrative law) that the

                        state would await a response to their petitions. all the petitions were

                        presented after the [jamaican] government had issued the instructions

                        [prescribing time limits for applications to the unhrc and/or the iachr by

                        offenders sentenced to death, and stipulating that no further postponement

                        of execution would be granted after the expiry of those time limits] and a

                        legitimate expectation can hardly arise in the face of a clear existing

                        contrary statement of policy. …
[emphasis added]
57     despite lord hoffmann’s powerful

                    dissent, the legal position in the caribbean states generally after lewis is that the clemency power is subject to judicial

                    review, although the merits of the clemency decision made in a particular case

                    remain non-justiciable (see, eg, the decision of

                    the caribbean court of justice in attorney-general and others

                        v joseph (jeffrey) and boyce (lennox) (2006) 69 wir 104

                        (“joseph and boyce”) and the

                    decision of the high court of trinidad and tobago in allan

                        henry and others v the attorney general of trinidad and tobago and the

                        commissioner of prisons (1 december 2009,

                    unreported)).
(3)   the position in canada
58     in canada, the clemency power was held by

                    reed j in ivan william mervin henry v minister of

                        justice (1992) 54 ftr 153 to be reviewable. in this regard,

                    it appears that the canadian position is that the clemency power is reviewable

                    on both procedural and substantive grounds, with the courts being prepared to

                    review a clemency decision on the merits in an

                    appropriate case. this emerges from the decision in wilbert

                        colin thatcher v the attorney general of canada, the honourable allan rock,

                        minister of justice, and the attorney general of saskatchewan

                    [1997] 1 fc 289 (“thatcher”).
59     in thatcher,

                    rothstein j pointed out (at [6])

                    that ever since the decision of the supreme court of canada in operation dismantle, cabinet decisions made pursuant to

                    prerogative powers had been subject to judicial review for compatibility with

                    the canadian charter. specifically, rothstein j cited the following passage

                    from dickson j’s judgment in operation

                        dismantle at 455:
… [c]abinet decisions fall under s. 32(1)(a) of the [canadian] charter [this provision sets out the

                        scope of application of the canadian charter] and are therefore reviewable

                        in the courts and subject to judicial scrutiny for compatibility with the

                        [canadian] constitution. … [t]he executive branch of the canadian

                        government is duty bound to act in accordance with the dictates of the

                        [canadian] charter. [emphasis in original omitted]
in effect, rothstein j held (in thatcher) that the merits of a

                    clemency decision and the manner in which the

                    decision was made could be scrutinised for compatibility with, respectively, the

                    substantive rights and the procedural rights set out in the canadian

                    charter.
(4)   the position in australia
60     the traditional position in australia was set

                    out by the high court of australia in horwitz v connor,

                        inspector general of penal establishments of victoria (1908)

                    6 clr 38 (“horwitz v connor”).

                    that case concerned an accused who had been sentenced to a total of six

                    years’ imprisonment. midway through his term of imprisonment, a writ of

                        habeas corpus was issued directing his

                    immediate release from prison even though the governor in council had not

                    ordered remission of any part of the imprisonment term. the supreme court of

                    victoria discharged the writ of habeas corpus. the

                    high court of australia refused to grant the accused special leave to appeal

                    against the supreme court of victoria’s decision on the ground that (at

                    40) “no court ha[d] jurisdiction to review the discretion of the governor

                    in council in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy”.
61     the position laid down in horwitz v connor was upheld by both lander j at first

                    instance and the court of appeal of the australian capital territory

                    (“act”) in eastman v australian capital

                        territory (2008) 227 flr 262 (“eastman (act)”). it should

                    be noted, however, that lander j, while accepting that he was bound by

                        horwitz v connor, also stated (see [78]–[79] of lander j’s judgment as reproduced at

                        [40] of eastman

                        (act)):
… i am not, i think, prevented … from concluding that the

                        processes [pertaining to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy] …

                        are subject to judicial review.
i think therefore i am entitled to inquire into whether the decision-maker

                        in the executive discharged its obligations at law in reaching its decision.

                        the decision itself is for the executive and [is] not subject to review.

                        however, if the executive has not conducted itself in accordance with the

                        law in reaching that decision and, in particular, [has] not observed the

                        rules of natural justice, the decision must be set aside.
in contrast, the act court of appeal appeared to take a narrower view.

                    it noted the privy council decisions (in appeals from the caribbean states)

                    departing from the traditional view set out in horwitz v

                        connor (namely, that the prerogative of mercy was not

                    reviewable), but stated (see eastman (act) at

                        [38]):
… [w]e are reluctant to treat those decisions as necessarily

                        offering a principled basis for departing from well-established legal

                        propositions. similarly, we are not persuaded that we may depart from the

                        decision in horwitz v connor in the interests

                        of promoting a consistent body of administrative law. until the high court

                        [of australia] holds to the contrary, the decision in horwitz v connor is binding on us.
62     the high court of australia dismissed the

                    application for special leave to appeal against the act court of appeal’s

                    decision (see david harold eastman v australian capital

                        territory [2008] hcasl 553) on the ground (per heydon and kiefel jj) that it was pointless to allow

                    the application since there was no reason to doubt the act court of

                    appeal’s decision on the particular issue which would form the crux of any

                    appeal against that decision. it should, however, be noted that kirby j,

                    whilst agreeing with the decision to dismiss the application, stated (at

                        [2]) that in a proper case, judicial

                    review would be available as a matter of law (heydon and kiefel jj did not

                    comment on this point in their joint judgment). thus, it would appear that in

                    australia, the law on whether the clemency power is reviewable by the courts is

                    not settled.
(5)   the position in new zealand
63     turning now to clemency cases from new

                    zealand, the new zealand court of appeal examined the justiciability of the

                    clemency power in burt v governor-general [1992]

                    3 nzlr 672 (“burt”). the

                    appellant in that case (“burt”) was convicted of murder and

                    sentenced to life imprisonment. his petition to the governor-general in council

                    for a full pardon was dismissed on the ground that the trial verdict could not

                    be considered unsafe. under s 406 of the crimes act 1961 (nz), the

                    governor-general in council, when considering a clemency petition, may (but is

                    not required to) refer to the new zealand court of appeal either a question

                    relating to the petitioner’s conviction or sentence or any other point

                    arising in the clemency petition, whereupon the new zealand court of appeal must

                    rule on the matter referred to it. in burt, the

                    governor-general in council rejected burt’s clemency petition without

                    referring any matter to the new zealand court of appeal for its consideration.

                    burt commenced judicial review proceedings, alleging that the governor-general

                    in council had failed to act fairly and reasonably in dealing with his clemency

                    petition. the governor-general in council applied to dismiss the action on the

                    ground that burt had no reasonable cause of action since his complaint concerned

                    the exercise of a prerogative, rather than a statutory, power. the

                    governor-general in council’s application was allowed at first instance,

                    whereupon burt appealed.
64     the new zealand court of appeal dismissed

                    burt’s appeal. cooke p, who delivered the judgment of the court,

                    acknowledged that the argument that the prerogative of mercy was justiciable, at

                    least to the extent of ensuring that elementary standards of fair procedure were

                    followed, “[could not] by any means be brushed aside as absurd, extreme

                    or contrary to principle” (at 681), partly because the issues raised by a

                    clemency petition were often not foreign at all to the judicial function.

                    nevertheless, after referring to the various safeguards in new zealand against

                    wrongful convictions and unfair procedures, cooke p held that (at 683)

                    “no pressing reason ha[d] been made out for altering the practice

                    regarding the [r]oyal prerogative of mercy”.
(6)   the position in india
65     in india, the clemency power is subject to

                    judicial review. in maru ram v union of india and

                        others (1981) 1 scc 107 (“maru

                        ram”), a decision by a five-member bench of the supreme

                    court of india, it was held in the joint judgment of three of the judges

                        (viz, y v chandrachud cj,

                    p n bhagwati j and v r krishna iyer j) that (at

                        [62]):
wide as the power of pardon, commutation and release … is, it

                        cannot run riot; for no legal power can run unruly like john gilpin on the

                        horse but must keep sensibly to a steady course. … [a]ll public power, including constitutional power, shall

                        never be exercis[ed] arbitrarily or mala fide and, ordinarily, guidelines

                        for fair and equal execution are guarantors of the valid play of power. we

                        proceed on the basis that these axioms are valid in our constitutional

                        order. [emphasis in original]
the position laid down in maru ram was

                    followed by a two-member bench of the indian supreme court in epuru sudhakar and another v govt of a p and others (2006)

                    8 scc 161 (“epuru sudhakar”),

                    where the court held (at [22]) that it

                    was “fairly well settled that the exercise or non-exercise of pardon

                    power by the president or governor, as the case [might] be, [was] not immune

                    from judicial review”.
66     

          epuru sudhakar

                    is an instructive case on the legal limits of judicial review of the clemency

                    power. in that case, the sons of the deceased, who had been murdered by the

                    second respondent, sought judicial review of the order of the governor of andhra

                    pradesh (“the andhra pradesh governor”) remitting seven years out

                    of the ten-year imprisonment sentence which had been imposed on the second

                    respondent upon his conviction for murder. the andhra pradesh governor had made

                    the remission order on the basis of, inter alia,

                    erroneous statements that the second respondent was “a good congress

                    worker” [emphasis in original omitted] (see epuru

                        sudhakar at [55]) and had

                    been falsely implicated in the murder, which had allegedly been committed by

                    another respondent. the indian supreme court held that the clemency process had

                    been tainted by not only the misleading information placed before the andhra

                    pradesh governor, but also the andhra pradesh governor’s conduct in taking

                    into account the assertion that the second respondent was “a good

                    congress worker” [emphasis in original omitted] (see epuru sudhakar at [55]).

                    that factor, the indian supreme court held, had “no relevance to the

                    objects sought to be achieved i.e. the consideration of the question whether

                    pardon/remission was to be granted” (see epuru

                        sudhakar at [56]). as the

                    remission order had been made based on extraneous and irrelevant grounds, the

                    indian supreme court set it aside.
(7)   the position in hong kong
67     in hong kong, the legal position on the

                    justiciability of the clemency power is similar to the english position

                        post-bentley. this can be seen from the hong

                    kong high court case of ch’ng poh v the chief executive

                        of the hong kong special administrative region case no 182

                    of 2002 (3 december 2003, unreported) (“ch’ng poh”), where hartmann j held (at

                        [38]) that while the merits of any clemency decision made by the chief

                    executive of the hong kong special administrative region of the people’s

                    republic of china (“sar chief executive”) pursuant to

                    art 48(12) of the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region

                    of the people’s republic of china (“the basic law”) were not

                    subject to judicial review, the lawfulness of the

                    process by which such a decision was made was open to judicial review. his

                    honour explained that this was because although the basic law gave the sar chief

                    executive prerogative powers, it did not seek to place him above the law as his

                    powers were defined and constrained by the basic law, the office of sar chief

                    executive being a creature of that law (at [35]).
(8)   the position in malaysia
68     in malaysia, the courts have consistently held

                    that both the clemency power and the merits of a clemency decision cannot be

                    questioned by the courts. in public prosecutor v soon seng

                        sia heng [1979] 2 mlj 170, which concerned (inter alia) the decision of the yang di-pertuan agong to

                    commute the death sentence of an offender who had, at the age of 14, been

                    convicted and sentenced to death under the emergency (security cases)

                    regulations 1975, the federal court made no order on the application for the

                    yang di-pertuan agong’s decision to be reviewed, stating (at 171 per suffian lp):
when considering whether to confirm, commute, remit or pardon, his majesty

                        does not sit as a court, is entitled to take into consideration matters

                        which courts bound by the law of evidence cannot take into account, and

                        decides each case on grounds of public policy; such decisions are a matter

                        solely for the executive. we cannot confirm or vary them; we have no

                        jurisdiction to do so. the royal prerogative of mercy, as is recognised by

                        its inclusion in chapter 3 part iv of the [malaysian]

                        constitution, is an executive power …
69     the federal court took the same approach in

                        chow thiam guan v superintendent of pudu prison & the

                        government of malaysia and connected appeals [1983] 2 mlj

                    116 (“chow thiam guan”). that case

                    concerned an application by the appellant for the execution of the death

                    sentence imposed on him to be stayed pending the hearing of an appeal which he

                    had filed in the federal court on the sole ground that the death sentence was

                    unconstitutional. the federal court, citing de

                        freitas, held that the courts had no jurisdiction to deal with

                    the stay application as “[a]ny stay of execution would be … an

                    extension of the prerogative of mercy, [which was] exercisable only by his

                    majesty the yang di-pertuan agong in accordance with article 42 of the

                    [malaysian] constitution” (at 119).
70     

          chow thiam guan

                    was followed in sim kie chon v superintendent of pudu prisons

                        & ors [1985] 2 mlj 385, a decision of the supreme court

                    of malaysia. the appellant in that case (“sim”), who had been

                    sentenced to death and who had exhausted all his avenues of appeal, filed an

                    action against (inter alia) the pardons board,

                    alleging that it had not considered his clemency petition properly. the high

                    court of malaysia struck out the action. on appeal, the malaysian supreme court

                    upheld that order, stating (at 387):
… [p]roceedings in court aimed at questioning the propriety or

                        otherwise of such a decision [viz, a decision

                        made in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy] are … not

                        justiciable. by the same token[,] a contention of any violation of the

                        fundamental right which rests wholly on or [is] dependent upon such an

                        allegation is also not justiciable. it is our considered view that the power

                        of mercy is a high prerogative exercisable by the yang di-pertuan agong

                        …, who acts with the greatest conscience and care and without fear of

                        influence from any quarter … ([s]ee hanratty …).
a second challenge by sim to the rejection of his clemency petition

                    was dismissed in superintendent of pudu prison & ors v

                        sim kie chon [1986] 1 mlj 494 (“sim kie chon (no 2)”) by the malaysian supreme

                    court, which held (at 497):
… [w]hen the constitution has empowered the nation’s highest

                        executive as the repository of the clemency power, the court cannot

                        intervene and judicial review is excluded by implication.
71     the case which bears the closest factual

                    correspondence to the present case is karpal singh v sultan

                        of selangor [1988] 1 mlj 64 (“karpal singh”). in that case, the applicant applied for a

                    declaration that a public statement allegedly made by the sultan of selangor

                    (“the selangor sultan”) and reported in two english newspapers

                    –

                    viz, that he would not pardon anyone who had been

                    sentenced to the mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking in selangor

                    – was in violation of art 42 of the malaysian constitution as the

                    selangor sultan had effectively predetermined any clemency petition which might

                    be filed by a convicted drug trafficker. the applicant contended that the

                    selangor sultan could only reject a petition for clemency after considering the

                    advice of the selangor pardons board and then applying his mind to the petition

                    before him. the chief justice of malaysia dismissed the application on the

                    ground that the allegation had not been proved, and, therefore, the issue was

                    hypothetical. he also held, citing sim kie chon

                        (no 2), that “an issue concerning the process of

                    clemency … [was] clearly non-justiciable” (see karpal singh at 67), and stated that “mercy [was] not the

                    subject of legal rights” (at 66).
72     most recently, in juraimi

                        bin husin v pardons board, state of pahang & ors [2002]

                    4 mlj 529 (“juraimi bin

                    husin”), the federal court applied lord roskill’s

                        obiter dictum in gchq that the prerogative of mercy was not justiciable. in

                        juraimi bin husin, the appellant (who had been

                    sentenced to death for murder) submitted a clemency petition to the sultan of

                    pahang. his petition was rejected. he applied for a stay of execution of his

                    death sentence pending his application to challenge the constitutionality of the

                    rejection of his clemency petition. the high court of malaysia referred to the

                    federal court for determination the question of whether the courts could review

                    the decision-making process of the sultan of pahang vis-à-vis the clemency power in art 15 of the laws of the

                    constitution of pahang, read with art 42 of the malaysian constitution. the

                    federal court answered this question in the negative, stating (at 537):
… [t]he effect of making the decision making process justiciable

                        would, in the final analysis, make the decision itself [vulnerable] to be

                        held null and void. this would have the same effect as [making] the decision

                        itself justiciable. consequently, we are of the view that any attempt to

                        make the decision process justiciable would indirectly make the decision

                        itself justiciable.
in other words, the court held that since the clemency decision made

                    in any given case was not justiciable, the process of making that decision was

                    also not justiciable.
analysis of the position in singapore 
73     i turn now to analyse what the legal position

                    in singapore is vis-à-vis the justiciability of

                    the clemency power.
74     i start by stating that the clemency power is

                    a legal power of an extraordinary character. it is unlike all other legal powers

                    in that:
(a)     it is an executive power which is

                        exercised as an act of executive grace and not as a matter of legal right

                        (see, eg, de

                            freitas and reckley).
(b)     a decision to grant clemency is “[a] determination of the

                        ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by

                        inflicting less [punishment] than what the judgment fixed” (per oliver wendell holmes j in biddle, warden v perovich 274 us 480 (1927)

                            (“biddle v perovich”) at

                        486). conversely, a decision not to grant clemency represents a

                        determination by the ultimate authority that the public welfare is better

                        served by allowing the law to take its course, ie, by carrying out the punishment prescribed by the

                        law.
(c)     ordinarily, the law should be allowed to take its course. however, when the

                        clemency power is exercised in favour of an offender, it will

                        “involve a departure from the law” (per lord goff in reckley

                        at 540) in that, in the interests of the public welfare, the law (in terms

                        of the punishment mandated by the law) is prevented from taking its

                        course.
(d)     the

                        considerations of public welfare that the ultimate authority deems relevant

                        in making a clemency decision are entirely a matter of policy for it to

                        decide. as was said by s h kapadia j at [65] of epuru

                            sudhakar (a decision relied upon by mr ravi),

                        “[t]he president and the governor [viz,

                        the ultimate authority in the context of india’s clemency regime] are

                        the sole judges of the sufficiency of facts and of the appropriateness of

                        granting … pardons and reprieves”.
(e)     in the specific context of a death

                        sentence case (which is also the context of the present appeal), the grant

                        of clemency to the offender confers a gift of life on him. this is because

                        the offender has effectively already been deprived of his life by the law

                        due to his conviction for a capital offence. if clemency is granted to the

                        offender, his life will be restored to him, whereas if clemency is not

                        granted, his life will be forfeited as decreed by the law. in other words,

                        in a death sentence case, the clemency decision made, be it in favour of or

                        against the offender, does not deprive the

                        offender of his life; the law (in terms of the conviction and death sentence

                        meted out on the offender by a court of law) has already done

                    so.
75     given that the clemency power is a

                    constitutional power vested exclusively in the executive, it is not justiciable

                        on the merits, firstly, on the basis of the

                    doctrine of separation of powers (see sub-para (d) of [74] above) and, secondly, on the basis of

                    established administrative law principles (see, eg, chandler at 809–810

                        per lord devlin and operation dismantle at 470 per

                    wilson j). in our local context, this entails that, assuming the clemency

                    power is exercised in accordance with law, the merits of the clemency decision

                    made will fall outside the purview of our courts. our courts cannot look into

                    whether a clemency decision is wise or foolish, harsh or kind; neither can they

                    substitute their own decision for the clemency decision made by the president

                    simply because they disagree with the president’s view on the matter. this

                    principle is common ground between the parties in the present

                appeal.
76     however, this conclusion –

                    viz, that the merits of a clemency decision are

                    not reviewable by our courts – does not, in my view, entail that the

                    clemency power in our constitutional context is therefore an

                    “extra-legal” power in the sense of being a power beyond any legal

                    constraints or restraints. in this regard, the following observations of the

                    indian supreme court in maru ram (another decision

                    relied upon by mr ravi) are pertinent:
62.    … wide as the power of pardon … is,

                            it cannot run riot; for no legal power can run unruly like john gilpin

                            on the horse but must keep sensibly to a steady course. … [a]ll

                                public power, including constitutional

                            power, shall never be exercis[ed] arbitrarily or mala fide and,

                            ordinarily, guidelines for fair and equal execution are guarantors of

                            the valid play of power. we proceed on the basis that these axioms are

                            valid in our constitutional order.

65.    pardon, using this expression in the amplest

                            connotation, ordains fair exercise, as we have indicated above.

                            political vendetta or party favouritism cannot but be interlopers in

                            this area. the order which is the product of extraneous or mala fide

                            factors will vitiate the exercise. while constitutional power is beyond

                            challenge, its actual exercise may still be vulnerable. likewise,

                            capricious criteria will void the exercise. for example, if the chief

                            minister of a state releases everyone in the prisons in his state on his

                            birthday or because a son has been born to him, it will be an outrage on

                            the [indian] constitution to let such madness survive.

                        …
[emphasis in original]
77     in my view, the aforesaid observations of the

                    indian supreme court are equally applicable to the clemency power under

                    art 22p. they are substantially a restatement of the chng suan tze principle that no legal power – including a

                    constitutional power (see [79]–[80] below)

                    – is beyond the reach of the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts if it

                    is exercised beyond its legal limits (ie,

                        ultra vires the enabling law) or if it is

                    exercised mala fide (ie, for an extraneous purpose).
78     in chng suan

                    tze, this court formulated the chng suan

                        tze principle as follows (at [86]):
in our view, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is

                        contrary to the rule of law. all power has legal limits and the rule of law

                        demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of

                        discretionary power.
more accurately stated, the principle is that “all legal powers … have legal limits[;] [t]he notion

                    of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law”

                    [emphasis added] (see law society of singapore v tan guat neo

                        phyllis [2008] 2 slr(r) 239 (“phyllis tan”) at [149]; see also raja azlan shah ag cj’s

                    statement in the malaysian federal court case of pengarah

                        tanah dan galian, wilayah persekutuan v sri lempah enterprise sdn

                        bhd [1979] 1 mlj 135 (at 148) that “[e]very legal

                    power must have legal limits, otherwise there is

                dictatorship”).
79     significantly, after chng

                        suan tze was decided, parliament enacted the constitution of the

                    republic of singapore (amendment) act 1989 (act 1 of 1989) to amend

                    art 149 of the constitution of the republic of singapore (1985 rev ed)

                    by inserting what is now art 149(3) of the singapore constitution. the

                    effect of this constitutional amendment was to restrict our courts’

                    supervisory jurisdiction, apropos national security decisions made under the

                    internal security act (cap 143, 1985 rev ed), to reviewing such

                    decisions for procedural improprieties only. save for this limitation,

                    parliament left untouched the full amplitude of the chng suan

                        tze principle, and thereby implicitly endorsed it. thus, in

                        phyllis tan, this court stated that the

                        chng suan tze principle, which was applied to

                    a statutory power in chng suan

                        tze (viz, the power to make

                    detention orders and to suspend such orders under, respectively, s 8 and

                    s 10 of the internal security act), was also applicable to a constitutional power (viz,

                    the attorney-general’s prosecutorial power under art 35(8) of the

                    singapore constitution).
80     specifically, what this court said in

                        phyllis tan was as follows (at [149]):
the discretionary power to prosecute under the [singapore] constitution is

                        not absolute. it must be exercised in good faith for the purpose [for which]

                        it is intended, ie, to convict and punish

                        offenders, and not for an extraneous purpose. as the court of appeal said in

                            chng suan tze … at [86], all legal powers, even a

                        constitutional power, have legal limits. the notion of a subjective or

                        unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law. in our view, the

                        exercise of the prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review in

                        two situations: first, where the prosecutorial power is abused, ie, where it is exercised in bad faith for an

                        extraneous purpose, and second, where its exercise contravenes

                        constitutional protections and rights (for example, a discriminatory

                        prosecution which results in an accused being deprived of his right to

                        equality under the law and the equal protection of the law under art 12

                        of the [singapore] constitution).
on the basis of the chng suan tze

                    principle as elaborated on in phyllis tan, our

                    courts must have the power to review the clemency power under art 22p on

                    the same legal basis as that stated in the above quotation.
81     a further reason (apart from the chng suan tze principle) for holding that the clemency

                    power is amenable to judicial review lies in the specific procedural safeguards

                    prescribed by art 22p for the conduct of the clemency process in death

                    sentence cases. article 22p, which is set out in full below, makes it clear

                    that these procedural safeguards apply only to death sentence cases, and are

                    inapplicable to non-death sentence cases:

22p.—(1) the

                        president, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the

                        cabinet —
(a)    grant a pardon

                                to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads

                                to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the

                                principal offenders, if more than one;
(b)    grant to any

                                offender convicted of any offence in any court in singapore, a

                                pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or

                                respite, either indefinite or for such period as the president may

                                think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such

                                offender; or
(c)    remit the whole

                                or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed

                                by law.
(2)    where any offender has been condemned to death by

                            the sentence of any court and in the event of an appeal such sentence

                            has been confirmed by the appellate court, the president shall cause the

                            reports which are made to him by the judge who tried the case and the

                            chief justice or other presiding judge of the appellate court to be

                            forwarded to the attorney-general with instructions that, after the

                            attorney-general has given his opinion thereon, the reports shall be

                            sent, together with the attorney-general’s opinion, to the cabinet

                            so that the cabinet may advise the president on the exercise of the

                            power conferred on him by clause (1).
82     unlike the position in non-death sentence

                    cases, in a death sentence case, the president is required under art 22p(2)

                    to cause the report of the trial judge and (where there is an appeal from the

                    trial judge’s decision) the report of the presiding judge of the appellate

                    court to be sent to the attorney-general, who must give his opinion thereon. the

                    attorney-general’s opinion and the aforesaid report(s), which collectively

                    form the art 22p(2) materials in a death sentence case, must then be sent

                    to the cabinet so that the cabinet may advise the president on the exercise of

                    the clemency power. in my view, the requirement that the trial judge’s

                    report, the report of the presiding judge of the appellate court (where there is

                    an appeal) and the attorney-general’s opinion on the report(s) must be

                    sent to the cabinet for its consideration necessarily implies a constitutional

                    duty on the cabinet’s part to consider those materials impartially and in

                    good faith before it advises the president on the exercise of the clemency

                    power.
83     it therefore follows that if, hypothetically

                    speaking, conclusive evidence is produced to the court to show that the cabinet

                    never met to consider the offender’s case at all, or that the cabinet did

                    not consider the art 22p(2) materials placed before it and merely tossed a

                    coin to determine what advice to give to the president (see, in this regard, the

                    example given in lewis at 76), the cabinet would

                    have acted in breach of art 22p(2). if the courts cannot intervene to

                    correct a breach of art 22p of this nature, the rule of law would be

                    rendered nugatory. in this regard, it should be noted that in singapore (just as

                    in many other common law jurisdictions which have elevated the clemency power

                    from a common law prerogative power to a constitutional power under a written

                    constitution), the making of a clemency decision pursuant to art 22p is now

                    “not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power

                    … [but] a part of the [c]onstitutional scheme” (see biddle v perovich at 486; see also epuru sudhakar at [62]).
84     my conclusion that the clemency power is

                    subject to judicial review may also be said to be a corollary of the right to

                    life and personal liberty guaranteed by art 9(1) of the singapore

                    constitution, which provides that “[n]o person shall be deprived of his

                    life or personal liberty save in accordance with law”. in reckley, lord goff said at 540 (also reproduced at

                        [51] above):
a man accused of a capital offence in [t]he bahamas has of course his

                        legal rights. in particular he is entitled to the benefit of a trial before

                        a judge and jury, with all the rights which that entails. after conviction

                        and sentence, he has a right to appeal to the [bahamian] court of appeal

                        and, if his appeal is unsuccessful, to petition for leave to appeal to the

                        privy council. after his rights of appeal are exhausted, he may still be

                        able to invoke his fundamental rights under the [bahamian] constitution.

                            for a man is still entitled to his fundamental

                            rights, and in particular to his right to the protection of the law,

                            even after he has been sentenced to death. if therefore it is

                        proposed to execute him contrary to the law, for example … because

                        there has been a failure to consult the advisory committee on the

                        prerogative of mercy as required by the [bahamian] constitution, then he can

                        apply to the [bahamian] supreme court for redress under article 28 of

                        the [bahamian] constitution. [emphasis added]
85     i agree with this statement of law

                    (interpreted mutatis mutandis) as regards the

                    applicability of art 9(1) of the singapore constitution to the clemency

                    process, not because an offender has any constitutional or legal right or even

                    any expectation with respect to the grant of clemency to him, but because the

                    requirements of art 22p(2) must be complied with as that is what the law

                    mandates. as just pointed out at [82]–[83] above, in a

                    death sentence case, the cabinet must consider impartially and in good faith the

                    art 22p(2) materials submitted to it before it advises the president on how

                    the clemency power should be exercised. that said, i reiterate that a decision

                    not to exercise the clemency power in favour of the offender in a death sentence

                    case does not, in the legal sense, deprive him of

                    his life or personal liberty since he has already been sentenced to death by a

                    court in accordance with law (see sub-para (e) of [74] above). if clemency is granted to an offender in a death

                    sentence case, it restores to him his life, which the law has already decreed is

                    to be forfeited.
the natural justice issue 
86     i turn now to the natural justice issue,

                        ie, the question of whether breach of natural

                    justice is an applicable ground for reviewing the clemency process (as defined

                    at sub-para (c) of [15] above), and, if

                    it is, whether the clemency process vis-à-vis the

                    appellant has been tainted by apparent bias in the present case as a result of

                    the law minister’s statements.
the rules of natural justice in administrative law
87     in arguing that there has been a breach of

                    natural justice in the present case, mr ravi relied on two specific rules

                    applicable in singapore as well as in commonwealth jurisdictions to judicial

                    review of administrative decisions (see william wade & christopher forsyth,

                        administrative law (oxford university press,

                    10th ed, 2009) at p 372). in my discussion of the natural justice

                    issue, i shall refer to these two rules collectively as “the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice” so as to distinguish them

                    from the “fundamental rules of natural justice” discussed by

                    lord diplock in the privy council cases of ong ah chuan

                        v public prosecutor [1981] ac 648 (“ong

                        ah chuan”) (at, inter alia,

                    671) and haw tua tau v public prosecutor [1982] ac

                    136 (“haw tua tau”) (at, inter alia, 153), which rules will hereafter be termed

                    “the ong ah chuan rules of natural

                    justice”.
88     the two specific rules which make up the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice are the following:
(a)     the rule encapsulated by the maxim

                            “nemo iudex in sua causa”

                        (“no one shall be a judge in his own cause”), which i shall

                        hereafter refer to as “the rule against bias”, as this rule is

                        more commonly known; and
(b)     the rule encapsulated by the maxim “audi alteram partem” (“hear the other

                        side”), which i shall hereafter refer to as “the hearing

                        rule”.
a breach of either of these rules in the

                    course of making an administrative decision is an established ground for setting

                    aside the decision in judicial review proceedings. the issue in the present

                    appeal is whether the administrative law rules of natural justice apply to the

                    clemency process as well.
89     before i proceed to analyse this issue, i

                    should highlight two points concerning my use of the terms “bias”

                    and “the rule against bias” in this part of my

                judgment.
90     first, unless otherwise indicated, the word

                    “bias” should be understood as denoting both actual bias and

                    apparent bias since the legal objection to apparent bias applies a fortiori to actual bias, especially bias that amounts

                    to a predetermination of the relevant matter to be decided. correspondingly, the

                    expression “the rule against bias” will, unless otherwise

                    indicated, cover both actual bias and apparent bias. (in this regard, there will

                    be instances in the discussion below where i shall refer to apparent bias and

                    the rule against apparent bias specifically in keeping with the basis on which

                    this case was argued in the court below.)
91     second, the rule against bias is different from and should not be equated with the constitutional prohibition against

                        discrimination, ie, the protection against unequal treatment conferred by

                    art 12 of the singapore constitution. what the rule against bias prohibits

                    is a person acting as a judge in his own cause in any matter

                        where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest. as

                    stated in lord woolf, jeffrey jowell & andrew le sueur, de smith’s judicial review (sweet & maxwell,

                    6th ed, 2007) (“de smith”) at

                    para 10-006:
the principle expressed in the maxim nemo iudex in sua

                            causa (no one should be a judge in his own cause) refers not

                        only to the fact that no one shall adjudicate his own case; it also refers

                        to the fact that no one should adjudicate a matter in which he has a

                        conflicting interest. in order to give effect to those two aspects of the

                        principle, the concern is not only to prevent the distorting influence of

                            actual bias, but also to protect the

                        integrity of the decision-making process by ensuring that, however

                        disinterested the decision-maker is in fact, the circumstances should not

                        give rise to the appearance of bias. as has

                        been famously said: “justice should not only be done, but should

                        manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done”. [emphasis in

                        original]
the parties’ arguments
92     before the judge, mr ravi argued that the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice applied to the clemency process, and

                    that pursuant to (specifically) the rule against bias, apparent bias in the

                    course of the clemency process would vitiate the clemency decision made at the

                    end of that process. in contrast, the respondent’s position was that since

                    the clemency power was not justiciable, apparent bias was not a ground which

                    could be invoked to challenge the clemency process in any given case. the judge

                    held that “apparent bias [was] not an available ground on which to review

                    the clemency process” (see sub-para (b) of [85] of the hc judgment), but it is not clear

                    from the context whether he was holding that the clemency power was not

                    justiciable per se, or that it was not justiciable

                    on the facts before him.
93     in the present appeal, mr ravi’s

                    contention is that the clemency process is an integral part of the process of

                    depriving a person of his life “in accordance with law” for the

                    purposes of art 9(1) of the singapore constitution. according to

                    mr ravi, the term “law” in art 9(1) (and likewise

                    art 12(1), which protects a person from discriminatory laws and/or actions)

                    incorporates the administrative law rules of natural justice, and, thus, the

                    clemency process must comply with those rules.
94     as authority for his proposition, mr ravi

                    cited lord diplock’s pronouncement in ong ah

                        chuan (at 670–671) on the meaning of the word

                    “law” as used in the then equivalent of arts 9(1) and 12(1)

                    of the singapore constitution, as follows:
in a constitution founded on the westminster model and particularly in

                        that part of it that purports to assure to all individual citizens the

                        continued enjoyment of fundamental liberties or rights, references to

                        “law” in such contexts as “in accordance with

                        law,” “equality before the law,” “protection of

                        the law” and the like … refer to a system of law which

                        incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part

                        and parcel of the common law of england that was in operation in singapore

                        at the commencement of the constitution. it would have been taken for

                        granted by the makers of the constitution that the “law” to

                        which citizens could have recourse for the protection of fundamental

                        liberties assured them by the constitution would be a system of law that did

                        not flout those fundamental rules. if it were otherwise it would be [a]

                        misuse of language to speak of law as something which affords

                        “protection” for the individual in the enjoyment of his

                        fundamental liberties, and the purported entrenchment (by article 5) of

                        articles 9(1) and 12(1) would be little better than a mockery.
mr ravi also referred to: (a) haw tua

                        tau, where the privy council (likewise per lord diplock) reiterated its views as set out in the

                    above passage from ong ah chuan; (b) the

                    decision of the caribbean court of justice in joseph and

                        boyce (at [62]–[64]); and

                    (c) the decision of the court of appeal of guyana in abdool salim yasseen and thomas v attorney-general (1996)

                    62 wir 98, where george ja referred (at 113–114) to the above

                    extract from ong ah chuan.
95     in contrast, the respondent’s case on

                    the natural justice issue in this appeal is that, as argued in the court below,

                    the administrative law rules of natural justice do not apply to the clemency

                    process because the clemency power is not justiciable. the respondent submits

                    that the extraordinary nature of the clemency power renders it unsuitable for

                    the clemency process to be subjected to the administrative law rules of natural

                    justice, which sit most comfortably in the context of judicial and

                    quasi-judicial decisions that involve the determination of rights and remedies.

                    in support of this proposition, the respondent cited ch’ng poh, where hartmann j, in discussing the

                    exercise of the clemency power set out in art 48(12) of the basic law, said

                    (at [111]) that “it would be

                    wrong in principle for [the] court to impose judicial or quasi-judicial

                    procedures and attitudes on what [was] the essence of an executive act”.

                    the respondent also referred to thatcher (a case

                    cited by mr ravi as well), where rothstein j made the point that the

                    duty of fairness on the part of the minister of justice (viz, the ultimate authority in the canadian context) must

                    necessarily be “less than that applicable to judicial proceedings”

                    (at [13]), and that even within the

                    context of s 7 of the canadian charter (which expressly provides for the

                    application of “the principles of fundamental justice”), all that

                    the canadian charter required in the clemency context was that the minister of

                    justice must “act in good faith and conduct a meaningful review”

                    (at [13]) of each clemency case before

                    him.
96     another reason advanced by the respondent as

                    to why the rule against apparent bias specifically is not applicable to the

                    clemency process is that this conclusion is supported by the very terms of

                    art 22p itself. in a death sentence case, art 22p(2) requires the

                    attorney-general, who (in his capacity as the public prosecutor) initiated the

                    criminal proceedings against the offender concerned, to give his opinion on the

                    trial judge’s report on the case and (if there is an appeal from the trial

                    judge’s decision) the report of the presiding judge of the appellate

                    court. this, in the respondent’s view, is further indication that the rule

                    against apparent bias has no application to the clemency process.
97     the respondent argues that even if the

                    clemency process is subject to procedural fairness as manifested in the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice (which is what mr ravi

                    contends), the only procedural requirements are those set out in art 22p,

                    and that to superimpose the administrative law rules of natural justice onto the

                    clemency process would result in the unwarranted creation of new constitutional

                    rights within the clemency regime by way of judicial pronouncement. in this

                    regard, the respondent emphasises that an offender has no legal right to

                    mercy.
98     for the foregoing reasons, the respondent

                    contends that the administrative law rules of natural justice have no

                    application to the clemency process, although he “does

                        not dispute that the rule against bias is a fundamental principle of natural

                        justice”[note: 15]

                    [emphasis added].
whether the administrative law rules of natural justice apply to the

                clemency process
the conceptual distinction between the administrative law rules of

                natural justice and the ong ah chuan rules of natural justice
99     in assessing the merits of the parties’

                    respective arguments on the applicability or otherwise of the administrative law

                    rules of natural justice to the clemency process, it is important to bear in

                    mind the conceptual difference between these rules

                    and the ong ah chuan rules of natural justice.

                    this conceptual difference is best appreciated by examining the context in which

                    the pronouncements on the ong ah chuan rules of

                    natural justice were made in ong ah chuan and

100    in ong ah

                        chuan, one of the issues before the privy council was whether

                    s 15 of the misuse of drugs act 1973 (act 5 of 1973), which provided

                    that a person who had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine would be

                    presumed, unless the contrary was proved, to have had the drug in his possession

                    for the purpose of trafficking, was unconstitutional. the appellants argued that

                    the presumption in s 15 (“the s 15 presumption”)

                    violated the then equivalent of art 9(1) of the singapore constitution as

                    it replaced the presumption of innocence with the presumption of guilt, and also

                    violated the then equivalent of art 12(1) of the singapore constitution as

                    it amounted to a denial of the equal protection of the law. in the course of the

                    hearing, lord diplock asked counsel for the public prosecutor if the public

                    prosecutor was contending that “provided a statute [was] an act of the

                    singapore parliament[,] then however unfair or absurd or oppressive it [might]

                    be[,] it [was] justified by article 9(1)” (see ong ah chuan at 659). counsel for the public prosecutor replied

                    that the issue was not relevant – to which lord diplock responded (at

                    659):
their lordships cannot accept that because they will have to deal with the

                        point. they are not disposed to find that article 9(1) justifies all

                        legislation whatever its nature.
101    proceeding on the basis that it was

                        not the case that the then equivalent of

                    art 9(1) of the singapore constitution “justifie[d] all legislation

                    whatever its nature” (at 659), the privy council examined whether the

                    s 15 presumption contravened the then equivalent of either art 9(1) or

                    art 12(1), and ruled in the negative. it was in this context that

                    lord diplock propounded his famous formulation of the meaning of the word

                    “law” as used in the then equivalent of arts 9(1) and 12(1),

                    as follows (at 670–671):
… their lordships are unable to accept the narrow view of the

                        effect of articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the constitution [ie, the then equivalent of the singapore

                        constitution] for which counsel for the public prosecutor contended. this

                        was that since “written law” is defined in article 2(1)

                        to mean “this constitution and all acts and ordinances and subsidiary

                        legislation for the time being in force in singapore” and

                        “law” is defined as including “written law,” the

                        requirements of the constitution are satisfied if the deprivation of life or

                        liberty complained of has been carried out in accordance with provisions

                        contained in any act passed by the parliament of singapore, however

                        arbitrary or contrary to fundamental rules of natural justice the provisions

                        of such act may be. to the full breadth of this contention one limitation

                        only was conceded: the arbitrariness, the disregard of fundamental rules of

                        natural justice for which the act provides, must be of general application

                        to all citizens of singapore so as to avoid falling foul of the

                        anti-discriminatory provisions of article 12(1).
even on the most literalist approach to the construction of the

                        constitution this argument in their lordships’ view involves the

                        logical fallacy of petitio principii. the definition of “written

                        law” includes provisions of acts passed by the parliament of

                        singapore only to the extent that they are “for the time being

                            in force in singapore”; and

                        article 4 provides that “any law enacted by the legislature

                        after the commencement of this constitution which is inconsistent with this

                        constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.” so

                        the use of the expression “law” in articles 9(1) and

                        12(1) does not, in the event of challenge, relieve the court of its duty to

                        determine whether the provisions of an act of parliament … relied

                        upon to justify depriving a person of his life or liberty are inconsistent

                        with the constitution and consequently void.
in a constitution founded on the westminster model and particularly in

                        that part of it that purports to assure to all individual citizens the

                        continued enjoyment of fundamental liberties or rights, references to

                        “law” in such contexts as “in accordance with

                        law,” “equality before the law,” “protection of

                        the law” and the like, in their lordships’ view, refer to a

                        system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice

                        that had formed part and parcel of the common law of england that was in

                        operation in singapore at the commencement of the constitution. it would

                        have been taken for granted by the makers of the constitution that the

                        “law” to which citizens could have recourse for the protection

                        of fundamental liberties assured to them by the constitution would be a

                        system of law that did not flout those fundamental rules. if it were

                        otherwise it would be [a] misuse of language to speak of law as something

                        which affords “protection” for the individual in the enjoyment

                        of his fundamental liberties, and the purported entrenchment (by

                        article 5) of articles 9(1) and 12(1) would be little better than

                        a mockery.

102    in haw tua

                    tau, a similar challenge was made to the constitutionality of

                    ss 188(2) and 195(1)–195(3) of the criminal procedure code

                    (cap 113, 1970 rev ed) (“the 1970 cpc”) as amended by

                    the criminal procedure code (amendment) act 1976 (act 10 of 1976), which

                    abrogated the common law right of an accused to make an unsworn statement from

                    the dock without subjecting himself to cross-examination. it was argued that the

                    aforesaid provisions of the 1970 cpc (as amended) were inconsistent with the

                    then equivalent of art 9(1) of the singapore constitution. the privy

                    council rejected this argument, reiterating (at 147 per lord diplock) the formulation in ong

                        ah chuan (at 670–671) of the meaning of the word

                    “law” as used in (inter alia) the

                    then equivalent of art 9(1).
103    it can be seen from the above outline of

                        ong ah chuan and haw tua

                        tau that in both cases, the ong ah

                        chuan rules of natural justice were articulated and applied in

                    the context of a constitutional challenge to the validity of legislation, and

                    not in the judicial review context, where what is challenged is an

                    administrative decision made pursuant to valid

                    legislation. for this reason, it is my view that a distinction must be made

                    conceptually between the ong ah chuan rules of

                    natural justice and the administrative law rules of natural justice. this

                    distinction stems from the difference in the juridical status of these two

                    categories of rules of natural justice. as i have just mentioned, the ong ah chuan rules of natural justice operate at the

                    constitutional level in relation to the validity of legislation, whereas the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice operate at an executive level in

                    relation to the validity of administrative decisions.
104    to elaborate, the effect of the privy

                    council’s ruling in ong ah chuan is that the

                        ong ah chuan rules of natural justice have

                    been incorporated into the content or meaning of the term “law” as

                    used in arts 9(1) and 12(1) of the singapore constitution, and form part of

                    “the ‘law’ to which citizens [can] have recourse for the

                    protection of [the] fundamental liberties assured to them by the [singapore]

                    constitution” (see ong ah chuan at

                    670–671). it follows that these fundamental rules have the status of

                    constitutional rules and, thus, can only be abrogated or amended by a

                    constitutional amendment under art 5 of the singapore constitution. in

                    contrast, the administrative law rules of natural justice, which apply to

                    judicial review of administrative decisions made under valid legislation, can be

                    abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation either directly or indirectly

                    (see, eg, de smith

105    in drawing a conceptual distinction between

                    the ong ah chuan rules of natural justice and the

                    administrative law rules of natural justice, i do

                        not imply that these two categories of rules of natural justice

                    are different rules. they are the same in nature and function, except that they

                    operate at different levels of our legal order, one to invalidate legislation on

                    the ground of unconstitutionality, and the other to invalidate administrative

                    decisions on the ground of administrative law principles (as to which, see

                        chng suan tze at [119]).
106    i mentioned earlier (at [88] above) that the administrative law rules of

                    natural justice consist of two specific rules, viz, the rule against bias and the hearing rule. in my view, these

                    two rules are the same in nature as the ong ah

                        chuan rules of natural justice as incorporated in substantive

                    legislation in the criminal justice context. this can be seen from the following

                    passage in ong ah chuan (at 671 per lord diplock):

one of the fundamental rules of natural justice in the

                            field of criminal law is that a person should not be punished for an

                            offence unless it has been established to the satisfaction of an

                            independent and unbiased tribunal that he committed it. this

                        involves the tribunal being satisfied that all the physical and mental

                        elements of the offence with which he is charged, conduct and state of mind

                        as well where that is relevant, were present on the part of the accused. to

                        describe this fundamental rule as the “presumption of

                        innocence” may, however, be misleading to those familiar only with

                        english criminal procedure. observance of the rule does not call for the

                        perpetuation in singapore of technical rules of evidence and permitted modes

                        of proof of facts precisely as they stood at the date of the commencement of

                        the constitution. these are largely a legacy of the role played by juries in

                        the administration of criminal justice in england as it developed over the

                        centuries. some of them may be inappropriate to the conduct of criminal

                        trials in singapore. what fundamental rules of natural

                            justice do require is that there should be material before the court

                            that is logically probative of facts sufficient to constitute the

                            offence with which the accused is charged. [emphasis

                        added]
107    the above passage states, in substance, that

                    our criminal justice system contains the following fundamental elements:

                    (a) the accused can be convicted of the offence charged only if the

                    ingredients of the offence have been proved by the prosecution according to the

                    standard of proof applicable to criminal proceedings (ie, the standard of beyond reasonable doubt); (b) the

                    tribunal trying the accused must be independent and unbiased; and (c) the

                    accused must be heard on his defence to the offence charged. accordingly,

                    legislation that abrogates any of these fundamental elements may be open to

                    challenge on the ground of inconsistency with art 9(1).
108    to return to the more immediate question

                    raised by the natural justice issue, since the administrative law rules of

                    natural justice were part of the common law of singapore even before the

                    commencement of the very first predecessor of the singapore constitution, there

                    is no reason why, in principle, they cannot apply to the making of a clemency

                    decision, which is an executive decision, albeit one made under a constitutional

                    power. in other words, even though the grant of clemency is a matter of

                    executive grace and not of legal right, i see no reason why the administrative

                    law rules of natural justice should not apply to the clemency process, provided the application of these rules is not

                    inconsistent with the terms of art 22p – an issue which i shall now

                    examine.
whether applying the administrative law rules of natural justice to

                the clemency process would be inconsistent with art 22p
(1)   the rule against bias
109    as mentioned earlier (see [96] above), the respondent argues (inter alia) that the rule against apparent bias is not

                    applicable to the clemency process because art 22p(2) requires the

                    attorney-general, who (in his capacity as the public prosecutor) initiated the

                    criminal proceedings against the offender concerned, to give his opinion on the

                    report of the trial judge and (if there is an appeal from the trial

                    judge’s decision) the report of the presiding judge of the appellate court

                    on the case. this requirement, it is contended, is inconsistent with the rule

                    against apparent bias; therefore, art 22p itself has abrogated the

                    rule.
110    with respect, i do not accept the logic of

                    the above argument. when the attorney-general decides whether or not to

                    prosecute an offender for an offence, his decision is based on whether there is

                    sufficient evidence to show that the offender committed that offence. in

                    contrast, when the attorney-general is giving his opinion under art 22p(2),

                    he is not giving an opinion on the same matter (as he has already decided that

                    the offender should be prosecuted, and as the offender has already been charged,

                    tried by a court of law and convicted), but is instead giving an opinion on

                    whether there is a case for granting clemency to the offender. there is no

                    conflict of interest involved. in any case, the issue of bias is relevant not so

                    much to the opinion of the attorney-general as to the decision of the ultimate

                    authority on whether or not to grant clemency – it is the possibility of

                    bias on the part of the ultimate authority that is relevant for the purposes of

                    the rule against bias as applied to the clemency process.
111    in my view, the rule against bias does apply

                    to the ultimate authority in the clemency regime. in our local context, it is

                    clear from the terms of art 22p that the ultimate authority is the

                    president since it is in him that the clemency power is vested. what is disputed

                    in this appeal (and this forms the discretion issue) is whether the president

                    acts in his discretion in exercising the clemency power, or whether he is bound

                    by the cabinet’s advice. if the former represents the correct

                    constitutional position, then what is relevant, vis-à-vis the rule against bias, is the possibility of bias on

                    the president’s part; if, however, the latter is the correct

                    constitutional position, then what is of concern is the possibility of bias on

                    the cabinet’s part.
112    regardless of whether it is the possibility

                    of bias on the president’s part or on the cabinet’s part that is

                    relevant for the purposes of the rule against bias, i accept that it is not

                    beyond the realms of possibility for the president or one or more members of the

                    cabinet to be placed in a position of conflict of interest vis-à-vis the clemency decision to be made (eg, if the president or a member of the cabinet is related to

                    the offender in question by blood or by other ties of kinship). but, it is also

                    important to bear in mind that an allegation of bias or conflict of interest on

                    the part of the ultimate authority is, in effect, a factual assertion. given the

                    evidentiary rule that “he who asserts must prove”, such an

                    assertion will be accepted by the court only if it is proved to the

                    court’s satisfaction. in this regard, i would add that the issue of bias

                    is less likely to arise when clemency is not

                    granted (see epuru sudhakar) than when it

                        is granted: this is because in the former

                    scenario, the ultimate authority has merely decided to let the law take its

                    course.
(2)   the hearing rule
113    in contrast to my ruling on the

                    applicability of the rule against bias, i am of the view that the hearing rule

                    does not apply to the clemency process. as mentioned at [27] above, the clemency power is derived from the prerogative

                    of mercy, which is a common law power.

                    historically, at common law, an offender seeking mercy had no right to be heard

                    during the clemency process (see, eg, horwitz v connor, hanratty, de freitas and reckley). this was the position in singapore when the

                    clemency power was a prerogative power. after the clemency power in singapore

                    became a constitutional power (in the sense of a power entrenched in a written

                    constitution (as to which, see [169]–[171] below)),

                    the common law position that an offender had no right of hearing during the

                    clemency process continued to apply. in the words of lord diplock in

                        de freitas at 247 (as applied mutatis mutandis to our local context), “[e]xcept

                    in so far as it may have been altered by the constitution[,] the legal nature of

                    the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy in [singapore] remain[ed] the same as it was in england at common law”

                    [emphasis added].
114    in short, the hearing rule has never applied

                    to the clemency process in singapore, both during the time when the clemency

                    power was a prerogative power and, subsequently, after this power became a

                    constitutional power. this situation is reflected by the absence of any

                    provision in art 22p for an offender (regardless of the offence which he

                    has been convicted of) to be heard during the clemency process. this is the

                    position even in a death sentence case. all that art 22p(2) specifically

                    provides for in a death sentence case is that the art 22p(2) materials

                    relating to the offender must be considered by the cabinet impartially and in

                    good faith before it advises the president on the exercise of the clemency power

                    (see [82]–[83] above). notably, art 22p(2) does not provide for any

                    right on the part of the offender in a death sentence case to file a clemency

                    petition. furthermore, even if the offender files a clemency petition, under the

                    terms of art 22p(2), the petition does not form part of the art 22p(2)

                    materials. that said, it is an established procedure in death sentence cases for

                    the prisons department to ask the offender (through his counsel) to file a

                    clemency petition, if he wishes, within three months of his conviction (or of

                    the conclusion of his appeal against conviction and/or sentence, as the case may

                    be). if the offender does file a clemency petition, the cabinet will no doubt

                    consider it together with the art 22p(2) materials relating to the offender

                    before advising the president on the exercise of the clemency

                power.
115    for the foregoing reasons, i hold that

                    whilst the rule against bias applies to the clemency process, the hearing rule

                    does not.
whether the law minister’s statements created a reasonable

                suspicion of bias by reason of predetermination
116    with the foregoing analysis of the law in

                    mind, i now examine mr ravi’s argument that the law minister’s

                    statements have engendered “a reasonable suspicion of bias by reason of predetermination”[note: 16] [emphasis added]. mr ravi

                    alleges that the law minister and, in turn, the rest of the cabinet have already

                    predetermined the advice to be given to the president vis-à-vis whether the appellant should be granted clemency. the

                    question before this court is whether there is any merit in this

                    allegation.
117    in the court below, mr ravi contended

                    that the law minister’s statements gave rise to “a reasonable

                    suspicion of bias by reason of predetermination”[note: 17]

                    as they showed that:
(a)     the law minister and, in turn, the

                        rest of the cabinet predetermined, even before receiving any fresh clemency

                        petition which the appellant might file, that the appellant should not be

                        granted clemency (see prayer 6 of os 740/2010);

                    and
(b)     the law

                        minister and his fellow cabinet ministers also predetermined, prior to the

                        release of this court’s judgment in yong vui kong

                            (no 2) on 14 may 2010, that the appellant should

                        not be granted clemency in the event of his appeal (viz, cca 13/2008) being dismissed (see prayer 7 of

                        os 740/2010).
those arguments were rejected by the

                    judge.
118    mr ravi reiterated the above arguments

                    before this court. in order to evaluate their merits, it is necessary to examine

                    closely the material parts of the law minister’s statements as reported in

                    the 10 may 2010 edition of today. they are as

                        follows:[note: 18]
[the law minister] was replying to a resident during a dialogue session at

                        siglap south community centre who asked if there would be changes on

                            this policy [ie, the mandatory death penalty for serious drug trafficking

                        offences], in light of the case of [the appellant].
…
“you save one life here, but 10 other lives will be gone. what will

                        your choice be?”
if [the appellant] escapes the death penalty, drug

                            barons will think the signal is that young and vulnerable traffickers

                            will be spared and can be used as drug mules, argued [the law

                        minister].
[emphasis added]
the following passage from the 15 may 2010 edition of today is also relevant:[note: 19]
the resident had asked if [the appellant]’s case would affect

                            singapore’s laws on the mandatory death

                            penalty.
[the law minister] replied: “[the appellant] (who was sentenced to

                        hang for trafficking in 47g of heroin) is young. but if we say, ‘we

                        let you go’, what’s the signal we’re sending?
“we’re sending a signal to all drug barons out there: just

                        make sure you choose a victim who’s young or a mother of a young child

                        and use them as the people to carry drugs into singapore.”
[emphasis added]
119    in my view, there are four difficulties with

                    mr ravi’s attempt to make out a case of “reasonable suspicion

                    of bias by reason of predetermination”[note: 20] based on the law

                    minister’s statements.
120    first, if one reads the material portions of

                    the law minister’s statements in their proper context and in good faith

                        (ie, without attributing bad faith to the law

                    minister as a starting point), it is plain that the law minister’s

                    statements were nothing more than an articulation of the government’s

                    policy of adopting a tough approach to serious drug trafficking offences by

                    imposing the death penalty as the mandatory punishment for these offences so as

                    to check and deter them. under s 213 of the criminal procedure code

                    (cap 68, 1985 rev ed), which was the applicable provision at the time

                    of the appellant’s offence (see now s 314 of the criminal procedure

                    code 2010 (act 15 of 2010)), the minimum age for imposing the death penalty

                    on an offender is the age of 18 (taking the age of the offender at the time he

                    committed the offence in question). hence, when the law minister referred to the

                    appellant as “young”,[note: 21] he was doing

                    no more than restating the legislative policy on the minimum age at which the

                    death sentence can be imposed on an offender and pointing out that if clemency

                    were to be shown to the appellant simply because he was only 19 years old at the

                    time of his offence, the aforesaid legislative policy would be undermined. the

                    law minister was not in any way indicating that

                    the appellant, in the event of his appeal in cca 13/2008 being dismissed,

                    should not be granted clemency.
121    second, in arguing that the law

                    minister’s statements have given rise to “a reasonable suspicion of

                    bias by reason of predetermination”,[note: 22] mr ravi has conveniently

                    ignored in its entirety the reasoning of the high court of australia in

                        minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia

                        legeng (2001) 205 clr 507 (“jia

                        legeng”) and hot holdings pty limited v

                        creasy and others (2002) 210 clr 438. jia

                        legeng, in particular, is pertinent in the present

                appeal.
122    the facts of jia

                        legeng are as follows. a chinese national living in australia

                    (“jia”) applied for a special entry permit. pending the processing

                    of his application, jia committed a number of offences in australia and was duly

                    convicted. subsequently, his application for a special entry permit was rejected

                    by the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs (“the

                    immigration minister”). jia appealed to the administrative appeals

                    tribunal (“the tribunal”), which set aside the immigration

                    minister’s decision and remitted the matter to the immigration minister

                    with a direction that jia qualified for a transitional (permanent) visa. shortly

                    after the tribunal’s decision, the immigration minister, in a radio

                    interview, expressed his concern about the tribunal’s decision and the way

                    in which the tribunal had dealt with a number of cases similar to that of jia.

                    the immigration minister did grant jia a transitional (permanent) visa as the

                    tribunal directed, but then exercised his discretion under s 501 of the

                    migration act 1958 (cth) (“the 1958 migration act”) to cancel the

                    visa on the ground that jia was not a person of good character; the immigration

                    minister also exercised his discretion under s 502 of that act to declare

                    jia an excluded person. jia applied for judicial review of the immigration

                    minister’s decision, contending that it was affected by bias or,

                    alternatively, had been made in circumstances where there was a reasonable

                    apprehension of bias.
123    the high court of australia ruled that the

                    immigration minister’s decision was not vitiated by bias. in their joint

                    judgment, gleeson cj and gummow j explained their reasoning as follows

                    (see jia legeng at [102]):
… [l]awyers usually equate “bias” with a departure

                        from the standard of even-handed justice which the law requires from those

                        who occupy judicial, or quasi-judicial, office. the [immigration] minister

                        is in a different position. the statutory powers in question [ie, the statutory powers under ss 501 and 502

                        of the 1958 migration act] have been reposed in a political official, a

                        member of the executive government, who not only has general accountability

                        to the electorate and to parliament, but who, in s 502, is made subject

                        to a specific form of parliamentary accountability. … the powers

                        given by ss 501 and 502 … [enable] the [immigration] minister in

                        effect to reverse the practical consequences of decisions of the tribunal in

                        the cases of the persons involved, even though no new facts or circumstances

                        ha[ve] arisen; and even though the [immigration] minister [was] involved in

                        the proceedings before the tribunal. as the circumstances of the radio

                        interview demonstrate, the [immigration] minister himself can be drawn into

                        public debate about a matter in respect of which he may consider exercising

                        his powers. he [may] equally well [be] asked questions about the cases in

                        parliament. the position of the [immigration] minister is

                            substantially different from that of a judge, or quasi-judical officer,

                            adjudicating in adversarial litigation. it would be wrong to apply to

                            his conduct the standards of detachment which apply to judicial officers

                            or jurors. there is no reason to conclude that the

                        legislature intended to impose such standards upon the [immigration]

                        minister, and every reason to conclude otherwise. [emphasis added]
124    in essence, what the high court of australia

                    held in jia legeng was that where a minister made

                    a public statement on the government’s policy on any issue, the rule

                    against bias ought not to be applied to him as though he were a judicial officer

                    or a quasi-judicial officer should he later be required to exercise his

                    discretion on a matter relating to that policy. i agree with this reasoning as,

                    otherwise, no minister would be able to speak on any governmental policy in

                    public lest his statement be construed as a predetermination of any matter which

                    he might subsequently have to decide in connection with the policy in question.

                    as stated in thatcher at [13] (see [95] above), the

                    duty of fairness which the rule against bias imposes on a minister must, by

                    virtue of a minister’s position, be less onerous than the corresponding

                    duty of fairness incumbent on a judge or a tribunal exercising a quasi-judicial

                    function.
125    applying the reasoning in jia legeng analogously, i find it unrealistic to regard the law

                    minister’s statements as evidence of bias or as giving rise to “a

                    reasonable suspicion of bias by reason of predetermination”.[note: 23]

                    to do so would mean, as i have just stated, that a government minister cannot

                    say anything in public (or, for that matter, even in parliament) to explain the

                    policy of any law which he has introduced or is about to introduce without

                    creating the spectre of bias in relation to (and thereby disqualifying him from

                    deciding) any particular matter apropos that law which might subsequently

                    require his decision.
126    the third weakness in mr ravi’s

                    contention on predetermination arising from the law minister’s statements

                    is that mr ravi has side-stepped the difficulty of explaining how, even if

                    those statements do indeed evince the law minister’s predetermination not

                    to grant clemency to the appellant, such predetermination can be attributed to

                    the other 20 ministers who currently make up the cabinet. in this regard,

                    mr ravi’s assertion that the law minister’s statements have

                    also infected the other members of the cabinet with bias consists only of empty

                    words, supported neither by facts nor by logic. that assertion has been advanced

                    merely to get over the difficulty of attributing the law minister’s bias

                    (assuming it is indeed reasonably apprehended) to the other 20 members of the

                    cabinet. although all cabinet decisions are made collectively under our

                    constitutional system, which is based on the westminster model, in any

                    discussion at a cabinet meeting on what advice should be given to the president

                    on the clemency decision to be made in a particular death sentence case, each

                    minister can only speak for himself. hence, mr ravi’s argument, even

                    taken at its highest, cannot cross this much higher hurdle of having to show

                    that when the law minister made the statements complained of (ie, the law minister’s statements), he was speaking on

                    behalf of his cabinet colleagues in relation to the advice to be given to the

                    president apropos whether or not clemency should be granted to the

                    appellant.
127    the fourth flaw in mr ravi’s

                    argument on predetermination arising from the law minister’s statements is

                    one that i mentioned during the parties’ oral arguments before this court

                    – namely, if one accepts mr ravi’s arguments, the logical

                    consequence would be that any articulation by a cabinet minister of the

                    government’s policy on the death penalty would lead to the entire cabinet

                    being disqualified from advising the president under art 22p(2) on the

                    exercise of the clemency power in all death sentence cases. the result (as

                    contended by mr ravi) would be that none of the death sentences imposed on

                    convicted persons can be carried out. effectively, the appellant’s death

                    sentence (and, likewise, all other death sentences which have yet to be carried

                    out) would have to be commuted. this would also in effect mean the abrogation or

                    suspension of the death penalty, a consequence too absurd to

                contemplate.
128    for the aforesaid reasons, there is no merit

                    in mr ravi’s contention that the clemency process vis-à-vis the appellant has been tainted by “a reasonable

                    suspicion of bias by reason of predetermination”[note: 24]

                    as a result of the law minister’s statements.
the disclosure issue
129    i now move on to discuss the disclosure

                    issue. to recapitulate, this issue concerns the question of whether the

                    appellant is entitled to disclosure of the art 22p(2) materials relating to

                    his case so as to afford him an opportunity to make adequate representations to

                    the president on any fresh clemency petition which he (the appellant) may file.

                    in the present case, the art 22p(2) materials consist of: (a) the

                    report of the judge who heard yong vui kong (hc),

                    (b) my report on cca 13/2008 in my capacity as the presiding judge of

                    the appellate court in that appeal; and (c) the opinion of the

                    attorney-general on these two reports. mr ravi relies strongly and

                        solely on the majority judgment in lewis (and its progeny) in support of his argument that

                    the appellant is entitled to such disclosure. as mentioned at

                    sub-para (c)(iii) of [55] above, the

                    majority in lewis held that the offender in a

                    death sentence case was entitled to be given a full copy – and not merely

                    the gist – of all the materials placed before the jpc for consideration in

                    connection with its constitutional duty to advise the governor-general on the

                    exercise of the clemency power; this was to enable the offender to make proper

                    representations on clemency to the jpc for its consideration (for convenience, i

                    shall hereafter refer to this holding as “the disclosure holding in

                        lewis”).
130    in so ruling, the majority in lewis departed from two previous decisions of the privy

                    council, namely, de freitas and reckley, both of which held that the offender in a death

                    sentence case was not entitled to disclosure of the materials placed before the

                    advisory committee for consideration in connection with its constitutional duty

                    to advise the ultimate authority on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. in

                        de freitas, the reason given by

                    lord diplock was that the decision of the ultimate authority (viz, the governor-general of trinidad and tobago) as to

                    how the clemency power should be exercised was “a purely discretionary

                    act” (at 247). in reckley, lord goff

                    agreed with lord diplock on the ground (inter

                        alia) that the relevant bahamian constitutional provisions gave

                    no right to an offender who had been sentenced to death to present a clemency

                    petition to the ultimate authority (viz, the

                    governor-general of the bahamas) – the clemency process was

                    constitutionally required in a death sentence case, whether or not a clemency

                    petition was made.
131    it is clear from the majority judgment in

                        lewis that the key reason for the

                    majority’s decision to depart from previous authorities was art 4 of

                    the american convention on human rights of 1969 (“the 1969 american

                    convention”), which, at the time lewis was

                    decided, jamaica had ratified but had yet to incorporate into its domestic law.

                    article 4(6) of this convention provides as follows:
every person condemned to death shall have the right to

                            apply for amnesty, pardon, or commutation of sentence, which

                        may be granted in all cases. capital punishment shall not be imposed while

                        such a petition is pending decision by the competent authority. [emphasis

                        added]
pursuant to art 4(6), at the time lewis was decided, jamaica allowed offenders sentenced to death

                    to present clemency petitions to the unhrc and the iachr, and also allowed the

                    jpc to consider the recommendations of these international bodies for the

                    purpose of advising the governor-general on the exercise of the clemency power

                    (see lewis at 80). given this context, it was

                    unsurprising that the majority in lewis held that

                    the applicants in lewis had a right to make

                    representations to the jpc and to disclosure of the materials required to be

                    placed before the jpc, including the reports of international human rights

                    bodies such as the iachr.
132    as mentioned at [56] above, lord hoffmann, who had also been a member of

                    the board in reckley, delivered a powerful dissent

                    in lewis. his lordship protested that the

                    disclosure holding in lewis was a mistake as there

                    was no justification for departing from the legal position laid down in

                        reckley, given that nothing had changed in the

                    intervening period of approximately five years since that case was decided (see

                        lewis at 88–90):
the board now proposes to depart from its recent decisions on all [the]

                        points [raised in lewis]. i do not think that

                        there is any justification for doing so. …
…
i entirely accept that the board is not, as a matter of law, bound by its

                        previous decisions. and i respect the conviction of the majority that this

                        is an occasion to exercise the board’s power to overrule the earlier

                        cases. but i think it is a mistake. the fact that the board has the power to

                        depart from earlier decisions does not mean that there are no principles

                        which should guide it in deciding whether to do so.
…
… if the board feels able to depart from a previous decision simply

                        because its members on a given occasion have a “doctrinal disposition

                        to come out differently”, the rule of law itself will be damaged and

                        there will be no stability in the administration of justice in the

                        caribbean.
i also mentioned earlier (at [61]

                    above) that in the australian case of eastman

                        (act), the act court of appeal likewise did not consider that the

                    privy council decisions on appeals from the caribbean states necessarily offered

                    a principled basis for departing from the position

                    laid down by horwitz v connor (which is in pari materia with the position laid down by de freitas and reckley).
133    in the present case, the judge rejected the

                    disclosure holding in lewis (as well as the other

                    aspects of the majority decision). at [64] of the hc judgment, he said:
the jamaican position [post-lewis] is based

                        on the premise that the clemency process ameliorates the problems with a

                        mandatory death penalty. it is therefore inapplicable to singapore, where

                        the court of appeal has held [in yong vui kong

                            (no 2)], in a challenge brought by [the appellant]

                        himself, that the mandatory death penalty is perfectly constitutional. the

                        jamaican position is also based on that jurisdiction’s ratification of

                        [the 1969 american convention], a treaty which does not apply in the

                        singapore context.
134    i agree with the judge’s rejection of

                    the majority judgment in lewis as being irrelevant

                    to our local context. that judgment was based on the finding that by virtue of

                    the 1969 american convention, the applicants in lewis had a legal right to petition for clemency (see lewis at 80, where lord slynn expressly pointed out

                    that the majority in lewis “ha[d] so far

                    dealt with [the] matter on the basis that there [was] a right

                        to put in ‘representations’” [emphasis

                    added]). in contrast, lord hoffmann, in his dissenting judgment, gave a

                    very convincing explanation of why that convention should not have been applied

                    in that case.
135    in contrast to the legal backdrop against

                    which lewis was decided, the legal position in

                    singapore is absolutely clear. there is no convention that binds singapore to

                    give a right of hearing to an offender during the clemency process in a death

                    sentence case - as i held in my discussion of the natural

                    justice issue, an offender has no right to be heard during the clemency process.

                    further, the terms of art 22p do not give an offender any right to petition

                    for clemency. since the existence of a right to disclosure of the

                    art 22p(2) materials is premised on the offender in a death sentence case

                    having a right to petition for clemency and/or a right to be heard during the

                    clemency process, it follows that no such right of disclosure exists under

                    art 22p. as lord goff explained in reckley in rejecting the argument by tr (the offender in that

                    case) that the principle of fairness entailed that he should be entitled to make

                    representations to the advisory committee and should, for that purpose, be

                    entitled to see the materials placed before the committee (at 542):
in support of this proposition, reliance was placed on the decision of the

                        house of lords in reg. v. secretary of state for the home

                            department, ex parte doody [1994] 1 a.c. 531. that case

                        was however concerned with a different subject matter, viz. the exercise by

                        the home secretary of his statutory power to release on licence a person

                        serving a sentence of life imprisonment. it was there held that the home

                        secretary was bound to afford a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence

                        the opportunity to submit in writing representations as to the penal element

                        in the sentence which he must serve, and further that, to enable those

                        representations to be effective, he [ie, the

                        home secretary] must make available to the prisoner the gist of the material

                        upon which he will [rely] when making his decision. what is important for

                        present purposes, however, is that lord mustill (with whose speech the

                        remainder of the appellate committee agreed) was careful, at

                        p. 556g–h, to distinguish that case from a case in which the

                        prisoner is “essentially in mercy” where there is “no

                        ground to ascribe to him the rights which fairness might otherwise

                        demand:” see p. 556h. that is precisely the present case. indeed

                        it is clear from the constitutional provisions under which the advisory

                        committee is established, and its functions are regulated, that the condemned man has no right to make representations to the

                            committee in a death sentence case; and,

                            that being so, there is no basis on which he is entitled to be supplied

                            with the gist of other material before the committee. this is entirely

                            consistent with a regime under which a purely personal discretion is

                            vested in the minister. of course the condemned man is at

                        liberty to make such representations, in which event the minister can (and

                        no doubt will in practice) cause such representations to be placed before

                        the advisory committee, although the condemned man has no right that he

                        should do so. [emphasis added]
this is likewise the position in our local context under

                    art 22p.
136    i am also of the view that the disclosure

                    holding in lewis is flawed in so far as it was

                    influenced by considerations such as: (a) the possibility that false or

                    incorrect materials might be placed before the advisory body tasked with

                    advising the ultimate authority on how the clemency power should be exercised;

                    and/or (b) the possibility that the advisory body’s members might be

                    unconsciously biased against the offender or might decide the matter in an

                    arbitrary or perverse manner. the majority in lewis expressed these concerns (at 76) as follows:
on the face of it there are compelling reasons why a body which is

                        required to consider a petition for mercy should be required to receive the

                        representations of a man condemned to die and why he should have an

                        opportunity in doing so to see and comment on the other material which is

                        before that body. this is the last chance[,] and in so far as it is possible

                        to ensure that proper procedural standards are maintained[,] that should be

                        done. material may be put before the body by persons

                            palpably biased against the convicted man or which is demonstrably false

                            or which is genuinely mistaken but capable of correction. information

                            may be available which by error of counsel or honest forgetfulness by

                            the condemned man has not been brought out before. similarly

                        if it is said that the opinion of the [advisory body] is taken in an

                        arbitrary or perverse way – on the throw of a dice or on the basis of

                        a convicted man’s hairstyle – or is otherwise arrived at in an

                        improper, unreasonable way, the court should prima facie be able to

                        investigate.
are there special reasons why this should not be so?
in [reckley] much importance was attached to

                        the composition of the advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy. the

                        experience, status, independence of the members is no doubt an important

                        feature of the process. it provides a valuable protection and prevents the

                        autocratic rejection of a petition by one person. their lordships do not

                        however accept that this is a conclusive reason why judicial review should

                        be excluded. [the members] may unconsciously be biased,

                            there may still be inadvertently a gross breach of fairness in the way

                            the proceedings are conducted. …
[emphasis added]
137    in my view, these concerns may be relevant

                    for the purpose of deciding whether, as a matter of principle, the clemency

                    power is justiciable. however, they are not relevant to the question of whether

                    the materials placed before the advisory body should be disclosed to an offender

                    sentenced to death who has no right to present a clemency petition and no right

                    to be heard during the clemency process.
138    more importantly, in my view, the risks

                    highlighted by the majority in lewis have no

                    bearing on the clemency process under art 22p(2) (ie, the clemency process in death sentence cases), where the

                    persons directly involved in the making of a clemency decision are:
(a)     the trial judge and, if there is an

                        appeal, the presiding judge of the appellate court, who are required to

                        write reports on the case;
(b)     the attorney-general, who is required to give his

                        opinion on those reports;
(c)     the members of the cabinet, who are required to consider

                        the aforesaid reports and the attorney-general’s opinion (viz, the art 22p(2) materials) impartially and

                        in good faith before advising the president on how the clemency power should

                        be exercised; and
(d)     the president, who is the ultimate authority in our local

                        context.
139    given the high constitutional offices held

                    by these individuals, no court is justified in hypothesising that the trial

                    judge and (where there is an appeal) the presiding judge of the appellate court

                    may write biased or inaccurate reports, or that the attorney-general may give a

                    spiteful opinion on the offender’s case, or that the cabinet members

                    and/or the president may be unconsciously prejudiced against the offender or may

                    not give his case full and fair consideration. in my view, until the contrary is

                    shown, the courts, instead of proceeding on such fanciful hypotheses, should

                    proceed on the basis of presumptive legality encapsulated in the maxim

                        “omnia praesumuntur rite esse

                    acta” – all things are presumed to have been done

                    rightly and regularly, ie, in conformity with the

                    law.
140    for the above reasons, i hold that the

                    appellant has no right to disclosure of the art 22p(2) materials relating

                    to his case.
conclusion
141    for the reasons given above, i would dismiss

                    this appeal.


        andrew phang boon leong and v k rajah jja:
introduction
142    this appeal raises a very important issue as

                    to whether the clemency power under art 22p of the constitution of the

                    republic of singapore (1985 rev ed, 1999 reprint) (“the

                    singapore constitution”) is amenable to judicial review, and, if so, the

                    extent to which the exercise of this power is subject to the legal principles

                    applicable in judicial review proceedings. we have read the foregoing judgment

                    of the chief justice (“chan cj”), and we fully agree with it.

                    for convenience, we will, in this judgment, use the same abbreviations as those

                    used in chan cj’s judgment.
143    as the background facts have been fully set

                    out in the hc judgment as well as in chan cj’s judgment, we will not

                    revisit them in this judgment. suffice it to say that in this appeal, the

                    appellant is challenging the judge’s dismissal of his application for

                    judicial review in os 740/2010, which was made under o 53 of the rules

                    of court (cap 322, r 5, 2006 rev ed). os 740/2010 is an

                    extraordinary application because the principal relief sought by the appellant

                    is a declaration – a form of relief which is not provided for under

                    o 53 of the rules of court (see [25]

                    above and also [189] below). the specific

                    declaratory order which the appellant seeks is a declaration that “it is

                    the … president and not his advisors [ie,

                    the cabinet, in the present context] who has the discretion to decide whether or

                    not to grant the [appellant]’s petition for clemency, this being a matter

                    in respect of which the president may decide in his discretion under

                    article 21(2) of the [singapore] constitution”.[note: 25] together with this

                    declaration, the appellant seeks, inter alia, an

                    order prohibiting the president from delegating to the cabinet his discretion to

                    grant clemency. the other reliefs sought by the appellant are set out in the

                    judgment of chan cj (at [8]–[9]

                above).
144    in his judgment, chan cj categorised

                    the issues raised by the appellant in this appeal under the following five heads

                    (at [15] above):
(a)the discretion issue;
(b)the justiciability issue;
(c)the natural justice issue;
(d)the disclosure issue; and
(e)the declaratory relief issue.
in addition, as mentioned in chan cj’s judgment (see

                        [23] above), mr ravi raised the

                    legitimate expectation issue.
mr ravi’s application for chan cj’s

                disqualification
145    before we consider the issues set out in the

                    preceding paragraph, it is desirable that we express our views on

                    mr ravi’s surprising application, made right at the outset of the

                    hearing of this appeal without any prior notice to either this court or the

                    respondent, to disqualify chan cj from hearing the appeal (for convenience,

                    we will hereafter refer to this application as “mr ravi’s

                    disqualification application”).
146    as can be seen from [16] above, mr ravi’s objection to

                    chan cj’s hearing the appeal was based on chan cj’s tenure

                    as the attorney-general of singapore from 1992 to 2006 – a fact which was

                    known to mr ravi long before this appeal was filed. specifically,

                    mr ravi’s objection was directed at the discretion issue.

                    mr ravi argued that chan cj, during his tenure as attorney-general,

                    must have advised the president that he (the president) had no discretion in

                    exercising the clemency power under art 22p. that being the case,

                    mr ravi submitted, should chan cj now decide that the president

                        has a discretion in exercising the clemency

                    power, he would have been remiss or negligent in his advice to the president

                    regarding clemency decisions made during his tenure as attorney-general. this,

                    mr ravi contended, would put chan cj in conflict as regards any

                    interpretation of the singapore constitution favourable to the appellant’s

                    case on the discretion issue, ie, any

                    interpretation to the effect that the president has a discretion in deciding

                    whether or not to grant clemency to an offender under art 22p. in effect,

                    the implicit suggestion at the heart of mr ravi’s disqualification

                    application was that chan cj would have to decide against the appellant on

                    the discretion issue in order to cover up his remiss or negligence (if any)

                    during his tenure as attorney-general.
the law on judicial disqualification
147    the basic rule which underlies the law on

                    judicial disqualification is that a judge is automatically disqualified from

                    hearing a case if he has a personal interest in the outcome of the case (see

                        william dimes v the proprietors of the grand junction

                        canal, t e skidmore, a boham, and

                        w w martin (1852) 3 hl cas 759; 10 er

                    301 (“dimes”)). the rationale of

                    this rule (“the judicial disqualification rule”) is that where a

                    judge is personally interested in the outcome of the case before him, he will

                    not be able to give an impartial and objective judgment on the case. if he were

                    to be allowed to adjudicate on the case notwithstanding this risk, that would,

                    without more, undermine public confidence in the integrity of the administration

                    of justice (see dimes at 793–794; 315). a

                    more recent and well-publicised example of the application of this rule is the

                    decision of a panel of the house of lords in regina v bow

                        street metropolitan stipendiary magistrate and others, ex parte pinochet

                        ugarte (no 2) [2000] 1 ac 119 setting aside the earlier

                    decision of another panel of the house of lords in regina v

                        bow street metropolitan stipendiary magistrate and others, ex parte pinochet

                        ugarte [2000] 1 ac 61 on the ground of apparent bias on the

                    part of one of the members of the panel in the earlier decision.
148    although it is of the utmost importance that

                    judges adhere scrupulously to the judicial disqualification rule, we are of the

                    view that any attempt to recuse a judge from hearing a case on the ground of

                    conflict of interest must be based on credible grounds, and must not be

                    motivated by any extraneous purpose; otherwise, the rule could become a charter

                    for abuse by manipulative advocates. in this regard, we respectfully endorse the

                    english court of appeal’s observation in locabail (uk)

                        ltd v bayfield properties ltd and another [2000] qb 451

                        (“locabail”) that a judge

                    “would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or frivolous

                        objection as he would [be] to ignore an objection of

                    substance” [emphasis added] (at [21]).
this court’s reasons for dismissing mr ravi’s

                disqualification application
149    this court dismissed mr ravi’s

                    disqualification application for the reasons set out by chan cj at

                        [17]-[22] above. we would only add that in our view,

                    mr ravi’s disqualification application was frivolous as it was based

                    on the most tenuous of grounds (to echo the words of the english court of appeal

                    in locabail at [21]). having regard to the timing of the application and the

                    manner in which it was made, it appeared to us that the application was

                    calculated to diminish the judicial process and disrupt the hearing of the

                    appeal so that a fresh hearing had to be convened. significantly, when pressed

                    by this court to explain why he had made the application in a dramatic fashion

                    only at the commencement of the hearing of this appeal when he had known as

                    early as 4 january 2011 (some two weeks before the hearing) that

                    chan cj would preside over this appeal, mr ravi admitted that he

                        “had thought about it, but … never

                        seriously felt that it would be that serious”[note: i] [emphasis added]. in our view,

                    whatever concerns mr ravi might have had about chan cj’s hearing

                    this appeal could not have been as serious as he claimed.
150    our conclusion that mr ravi’s

                    disqualification application was devoid of merit was reinforced by the

                    consideration that mr ravi ought to have known that one of the central

                    premises of his disqualification application –

                    viz, that the president can act in his discretion

                    in exercising the clemency power – was wholly untenable, notwithstanding

                    that it had been boldly dressed up as a plausible legal argument. as we will show below, mr ravi, in seeking

                    to derive support for his argument from the legislative history of the clemency

                    power in this jurisdiction, referred (albeit in a piecemeal fashion) to

                    materials that proved, at every juncture, that his argument was in fact flawed

                    in its understanding of both the relevant legislative history as well as the

                    very language of the relevant provisions of the singapore constitution.

                    mr ravi’s own research showed (although mr ravi failed to either

                    recognise or accept this) that: (a) it was established

                        law in singapore even before 9 august 1965 (“singapore

                        day”), the day on which singapore became an independent sovereign

                        republic, that in our local context, the ultimate authority (as defined

                        at[33] above) had no discretion in exercising the clemency power;

                        and (b) this legal position was confirmed by parliament on singapore

                        day itself. all the previous presidents since singapore day have

                    exercised the clemency power on the basis that they were bound by the advice of

                    the cabinet. as chan cj observed in his judgment (at [22] above), mr ravi wanted to overturn this

                    aspect of our constitutional order for no reason other than that it suited his

                    purpose in the present proceedings.
the discretion issue
151    turning now to the discretion issue, this

                    issue raises a very simple point of law, namely: under our constitutional

                    framework, does the ultimate authority have a discretion in exercising the

                    clemency power, or is he bound to follow the cabinet’s advice? in this

                    regard, it should be noted that the discretion issue does not concern the question of who the ultimate authority is under

                    our constitutional framework – it is clear from the wording of

                    art 22p (especially art 22p(1)) that the ultimate authority in our

                    local context is the president since it is he who carries out the formal act of

                    either granting or refusing clemency to an offender (in this regard, see also

                        [111] above).
the judge’s decision on the discretion issue
152    mr ravi’s argument before the

                    judge was that the president did not necessarily have to act on the advice of

                    the cabinet in exercising the clemency power. his argument rested specifically

                    on the word “may” in the phrase “may, on the advice of the

                    cabinet” in art 22p(1). it was contended that art 22p vested

                    the clemency power in the president and not the cabinet; therefore, in view of

                        art 21(2)(i) of the singapore

                    constitution, the president could act in his own discretion in exercising the

                    clemency power. mr ravi cited no authority for his argument, perhaps

                    because he was unable to find any supporting authority and/or perhaps because he

                    thought it was unnecessary to cite any authority in support, the law on this

                    point being (in his view) clear and well established.
153    in the hc judgment, the judge rejected

                    mr ravi’s argument as follows:
69    under the [singapore] constitution, the default

                            position is that the president acts in accordance with the advice of the

                            cabinet or a minister acting under the general authority of the cabinet.

                            this is specifically provided for under art 21(1) of the

                            [singapore] constitution:

discharge and performance of

                            functions of president


21.—(1) except as provided by

                            this constitution, the president shall, in the exercise of his functions

                            under this constitution or any other written law, act

                                in accordance with the advice of the cabinet or of a minister acting

                                under the general authority of the cabinet.
…
the exceptions to this default position are exhaustively set

                        out in art 21(2), which provides that the president may act in his

                        discretion for the following functions:
(2)    the president

                                    may act in his discretion in the

(a)    the

                                    appointment of the prime minister in accordance with

(b)    the

                                    withholding of consent to a request for a dissolution of

                                    parliament;
(c)    the

                                    withholding of assent to any bill under article *5a, 22e,

                                    22h, 144(2) or 148a;
*article 5a was not in operation at the date of this

                                reprint.
(d)    the

                                    withholding of concurrence under article 144 to any

                                    guarantee or loan to be given or raised by the

                                    government;
(e)    the

                                    withholding of concurrence and approval to the appointments and

                                    budgets of the statutory boards and government companies to

                                    which articles 22a and 22c, respectively,

                                apply;
(f)    the

                                    disapproval of transactions referred to in article 22b(7),

                                    22d(6) or 148g;
(g)    the

                                    withholding of concurrence under article 151(4) in relation

                                    to the detention or further detention of any person under any

                                    law or ordinance made or promulgated in pursuance of

                                    part xii;
(h)    the exercise

                                    of his functions under section 12 of the maintenance of

                                    religious harmony act (cap. 167a); and
(i)    any other

                                    function the performance of which the president is authorised by

                                    this constitution to act in his discretion.
...
(5)    the legislature

                                may by law make provision to require the president to act after

                                consultation with, or on the recommendation of, any person or body

                                of persons other than the cabinet in the exercise of his functions

                                other than —
(a)    functions

                                    exercisable in his discretion; and
(b)    functions

                                    with respect to the exercise of which provision is made in any

                                    other provision of this constitution.
…
70    mr ravi submitted that based on the saving

                            clause under art 21(2)(i), the

                            president may act in his own discretion to grant pardons since the

                            discretion to do so is vested with the president and not the cabinet

                            under [art] 22p. however[,] on a plain reading of

                            [art] 22p(1), it is clear that the president does not have any

                            discretion and can only act on the advice of the cabinet in granting a

                            pardon to a convicted offender …
[emphasis in original]
our decision on the discretion issue
154    we agree with the judge’s

                    interpretation of art 22p as set out in the above extract from the hc

                    judgment. mr ravi’s argument on the discretion issue is wholly

                    misconceived. mr ravi pursued his argument even though he (and, presumably,

                    his advisers) must have known that the position which he advocated was not the

                    law under a constitution based on the westminster model (such as the singapore

                    constitution (see ong ah chuan at 669)) since he

                    actually referred to (inter alia) a decision of

                    the supreme court of india (viz, maru ram) in connection with his argument on the

                    justiciability issue, (seemingly) without being aware that that decision made it

                    abundantly clear that the ultimate authority had no discretion in the exercise

                    of the clemency power (see below at [175]).

                    indeed, as alluded to at [150] above, in

                    citing authorities which he believed to be supportive of his case on the

                    discretion issue, mr ravi in fact undermined his own case.
155    in our view, there are four factors which

                    render mr ravi’s argument on the discretion issue untenable,

                    namely:
(a)     the wording of

                    art 22p;
(b)     the

                        legislative history of the clemency power in this

                    jurisdiction;
(c)     case

                        law on the clemency power; and
(d)     the nature of the president’s powers under

                        singapore’s constitutional framework.
we shall

                    elaborate on these factors seriatim in the analysis which follows.
the wording of art 22p
156    taking the first of the aforesaid factors,

                    the wording of art 22p makes it clear that the president has no discretion

                    as to how the clemency power should be exercised in a particular case. this

                    article provides as follows:

22p.—(1) the

                        president, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of

                            the cabinet —
(a)    grant a pardon

                                to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads

                                to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the

                                principal offenders, if more than one;
(b)    grant to any

                                offender convicted of any offence in any court in singapore, a

                                pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or

                                respite, either indefinite or for such period as the president may

                                think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such

                                offender; or
(c)    remit the whole

                                or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed

                                by law.
(2)    where any offender has been condemned to death by

                            the sentence of any court and in the event of an appeal such sentence

                            has been confirmed by the appellate court, the president shall cause the

                            reports which are made to him by the judge who tried the case and the

                            chief justice or other presiding judge of the appellate court to be

                            forwarded to the attorney-general with instructions that, after the

                            attorney-general has given his opinion thereon, the reports shall be

                            sent, together with the attorney-general’s opinion, to the cabinet

                                so that the cabinet may advise the president on

                                the exercise of the power conferred on him by

                                clause (1).
[emphasis added]
157    the words “on the advice of the

                    cabinet” in art 22p(1) cannot be any clearer, especially when they

                    are read in the light of the words “act in accordance with the advice of

                    the cabinet” in art 21(1). the aforesaid words in art 22p(1)

                    mean what they say. they do not mean what mr ravi says they mean, ie, that the president may act against the advice of the cabinet. mr ravi has made great

                    play on the word “may” in the phrase “may, on the advice of

                    the cabinet” in art 22p(1) as vesting a personal discretion in the

                    president. mr ravi is wrong. the word “may” in that context

                    does not connote a personal discretion which allows the president to reject the

                    advice of the cabinet as to how the clemency power is to be exercised in a

                    particular case – otherwise, the advice of the cabinet would be pointless.

                    the word “may” in art 22p(1) simply vests the president with

                    the constitutional power to make a clemency decision (as defined at

                    sub-para (c) of [34] above) on the

                    advice of the cabinet –

                    ie, that word has an authorising or enabling

                    effect, absent which the president would have no legal power to make any

                    decision under art 22p.
the legislative history of the clemency power in this

                jurisdiction
158    our view that the president has no

                    discretion in exercising the clemency power is incontrovertibly supported by the

                    legislative history of the clemency power in this jurisdiction (presently

                    embodied in art 22p).
159    from 1819 to 1963, singapore was part of the

                    uk. the first direct election to the legislative council of singapore was held

                    in 1948 (singapore having become a separate crown colony in 1946) pursuant to

                    the singapore colony orders in council 1946 to 1948, which comprised the

                    singapore colony order in council 1946 (gn no s 2/1946), the singapore

                    colony (amendment) order in council 1947 (gn no s 128/1947), the

                    singapore colony (amendment) order in council 1948 (gn no s 75/1948)

                    and the singapore colony (amendment) (no 2) order in council 1948 (gn

                    no s 113/1948). the first real change in singapore’s

                    constitutional order came with the appointment in 1953 of the constitutional

                    commission headed by sir george rendel (commonly known as “the

                    rendel commission”), most of whose recommendations were implemented

                    through the promulgation of the singapore colony order in council 1955 (gn

                    no s 38/1955) (“the 1955 order in

                council”).
(1)   the 1955 order in council
160    section 6 of the 1955 order in council

                    provided for a governor and commander-in-chief (“governor”) over

                    the colony of singapore. under s 19, the governor was obliged to consult

                    with the council of ministers (consisting of the governor as president, three

                        ex officio ministers and six appointed

                    ministers (see s 17)), and had to act in accordance with the advice of the

                    council of ministers in the exercise of all powers conferred upon him, except

                        (inter alia) “in the exercise of any

                    power which he [was] directed or empowered to exercise in his discretion”

                    (see s 19(1)(i)). the power to grant pardon was conferred upon the governor

                    under s 14 as follows:
14.    when any offence has been committed for which the

                            offender may be tried in the colony the governor may, as he shall see

                            fit, in her majesty’s name and on her majesty’s behalf,

                            grant a pardon to any accomplice in such offence who shall give such

                            information as shall lead to the conviction of the principal offender,

                            or of any one of such principal offenders if more than one; and further,

                            may grant to any offender convicted of any such offence in any court

                            within the colony a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions,

                            or any respite, either indefinite or for such period as the governor may

                            think fit, of the execution of any sentence passed on such offender, and

                            may remit the whole or any part of such sentence or of any penalties or

                            forfeitures otherwise due to her majesty.
that power was expressly stated in s 15 to be exercisable by

                    the governor “acting in his

                    discretion” [emphasis added].
161    the instructions passed under the royal sign

                    manual and signet to the governor and commander-in-chief of the colony of

                    singapore dated 24 february 1955 (“the 1955 royal

                    instructions”), which were published in the colony of

                        singapore government gazette supplement (gn

                    no s 73/1955) on 4 march 1955, formed the constitutional

                    framework for the colony of singapore at that time, along with the 1955 order in

                    council. under s 12 of the 1955 royal instructions, the exercise of the

                    power of pardon in death sentence cases was regulated as follows:

12.—(1)(a) whenever any offender shall have been condemned by

                        the sentence of any civil court in the colony to suffer death, the governor shall call upon the judge who presided at the

                            trial to make to him a written report of the case of such offender, and

                            shall cause such report to be taken into consideration at a meeting of

                            the council of ministers, and he may cause the said judge to

                        be specially summoned to attend such meeting and to produce his notes taken

                        thereat.
(b)    the governor shall

                            not pardon or reprieve any such offender unless it shall appear

                            expedient to him so to do upon receiving the advice

                                of the council of ministers thereon; but he is to decide either to extend or to withhold a pardon or

                                reprieve according to his own deliberate judgment, whether the

                                members of the council of ministers concur therein or

                                otherwise; entering, nevertheless, in the minutes of the

                            council his reasons at length in case he should decide … such

                            question in opposition to the judgment of the majority of the members

                            thereof.
[emphasis added]
162    the terms of s 12 of the 1955 royal

                    instructions made it plain that the governor had a personal discretion in

                    exercising the power of pardon. while he had the benefit of the advice of the

                    council of ministers, he could decide, “according to

                        his own deliberate judgment” [emphasis added] (see

                        s 12(1)(b)), not to follow that advice.

                    this was consistent with the governor’s express power to grant pardon

                    “acting in his discretion” under s 15 of the 1955 order in

                    council. however, as s 12(1)(b) of the 1955

                    royal instructions also made clear, the governor’s discretion in this

                    regard was not wholly unfettered: in the event

                    that the governor decided to disregard the advice of the council of ministers,

                    he was obliged to give his reasons for doing so “at length” (see

                        s 12(1)(b)). it is noteworthy that such a

                    situation obtained during a time when singapore was still a british

                    colony.
(2)   the singapore (constitution) order in council 1958 (gn

                no s 293/1958)
163    time did not stand still after the aforesaid

                    constitutional framework was established. the british government decided to

                    grant statehood to singapore in 1959, leading to the colony of singapore being

                    renamed “the state of singapore” under the state of singapore act

                    1958 (c 59) (uk) (“the state of singapore act”). although

                    singapore ceased to be called “the colony of singapore”, its

                    legislature remained subject to the provisions of the colonial laws validity act

                    1865 (c 63) (uk) (see o hood phillips, “the constitution of the

                    state of singapore” [1960] pl 50 (“phillips”) at p 53).
164    on 3 june 1959 (following the general

                    election held on 30 may 1959), the singapore (constitution) order in

                    council 1958 (gn no s 293/1958) (“the 1958 order in

                    council”), which was made pursuant to s 1 of the state of singapore

                    act, came into force. under the 1958 order in council, responsibility for

                    internal security, finance and law was transferred from the uk to elected

                    ministers. singapore thereby acquired internal

                        self-government, with a prime minister and other ministers

                    forming the cabinet, which was collectively responsible to the legislative

                    assembly. the instructions passed under the royal sign manual and signet to the

                    yang di-pertuan negara, singapore, dated 12 december 1958 (“the 1958

                    royal instructions”), which were published in the colony of singapore government gazette supplement (gn

                    no s 166/1959) on 10 april 1959, completed the constitutional

                    instruments that were applicable to singapore at that particular point in

                    time.
165    under s 4(1) of the 1958 order in

                    council, the queen’s representative in singapore was given the malay title

                    of “yang di-pertuan negara” (ie,

                    head of state). the functions of the yang di-pertuan negara were “similar

                    to those of a governor-general of a dominion or head of state as regards such

                    matters as the appointment and dismissal of ministers, assenting to bills and

                    dissolving the [legislative] assembly” (see phillips at p 55). under s 9 of the 1958 order in

                    council, the yang di-pertuan negara had the power to grant pardon as

                    follows:
9.    the yang di-pertuan

                            negara, as occasion shall arise, may, in her majesty’s name and on

                            her majesty’s behalf —
(i)    grant a pardon to any accomplice in any

                                offence (being an offence for which the offender may be tried in

                                singapore) who gives information which leads to the conviction of

                                the principal offender or any one of the principal offenders if more

                                than one;
(ii)   grant to any offender convicted of any

                                offence in any court in singapore a pardon, either free or subject

                                to lawful conditions, or any respite, either indefinite or for such

                                period as the yang di-pertuan negara may think fit, of the execution

                                of any sentence passed on such offender; and
(iii)   remit the whole or any part of any such

                                sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture otherwise due to her

                                majesty:
provided that the power conferred by this section shall not extend to any

                        trial before, or any conviction in or any sentence, penalty or forfeiture

                        imposed by any court-martial (however styled) other than a court-martial

                        constituted by or under any law which was enacted (whether before or after

                        the appointed day [as defined in s 1(1) of the 1958 order in council])

                        by any legislature in singapore and which is applicable only to naval or

                        military forces raised in singapore by virtue of any law so enacted.
166    unlike the 1955 order in council and the

                    1955 royal instructions, neither the 1958 order in

                    council nor the 1958 royal instructions expressly

                    provided that the power of pardon was exercisable by the yang di-pertuan negara

                    acting in his discretion. instead, s 2(a) of

                    the 1958 royal instructions required the yang di-pertuan negara to consult with

                    the cabinet, or a minister acting under the general authority of the cabinet, in

                    the exercise of all his powers and functions, other than: (a) those powers

                    and functions which were expressed to be exercisable by him on the advice of any

                    person or authority other than the cabinet (for example, on the advice of the

                    united kingdom commissioner or the public service commission referred to in

                    s 15 and s 76 respectively of the 1958 order in council); and

                    (b) those powers and functions which were expressed to be exercisable by

                    him in his discretion (for example, the appointment and the dismissal of the

                    prime minister under s 21(1) and s 22(1)(c) respectively of the 1958 order in council, and the

                    dissolution of the legislative assembly under s 62(3) thereof). where the

                    yang di-pertuan negara was required to consult with the cabinet or a minister or

                    some other person or authority, he must act in

                    accordance with the advice given (see ss 2(b)

                    and 2(c) of the 1958 royal instructions).

                    particularly in relation to the exercise of the power of

                        pardon, s 1 of the 1958 royal instructions provided for the

                    following procedure:
1.    where any offender has been condemned to death by

                            the sentence of any court, the yang di-pertuan negara shall cause the

                            report which is made to him by the judge who tried the case to be

                            forwarded to the state advocate-general with instructions that, after

                            the state advocate-general has advised thereon, the report shall be

                            sent, together with the state advocate-general’s advice, to the

                            cabinet, so that the cabinet may advise the yang

                                di-pertuan negara on the exercise of the powers conferred on him by

                                section 9 of the [1958 order in council]. [emphasis

                            added]
(3)   the sabah, sarawak and singapore (state constitutions) order

                in council 1963 (gn sp no s 1/1963)
167    singapore obtained its independence from the

                    uk by joining the federation of malaya and the former british colonies of north

                    borneo and sarawak to form the federation of malaysia (“the

                    federation”) on 16 september 1963. under s 4(2)(c) of the malaysia act (no 26 of 1963)

                    (m’sia) (“the malaysia act”), singapore became a state of

                    the federation. as a state of the federation, singapore operated the state

                    constitution set out in sched 3 to the sabah, sarawak and singapore (state

                    constitutions) order in council 1963 (gn sp no s 1/1963) (“the

                    constitution of the state of singapore”) under the overarching purview of

                    the federation of malaysia constitution (“the 1963 federal

                    constitution”). under art 5(3) of the constitution of the state of

                    singapore, the legislature was empowered to make provision for requiring the

                    yang di-pertuan negara to act after consultation with or on the recommendation

                    of any person or body of persons other than the cabinet in the exercise of his

                    functions, other than functions exercisable in his discretion (see

                        art 5(3)(a) of the constitution of the

                    state of singapore) and functions in respect of which provision for the exercise

                    was made in any other provision of either the constitution of the state of

                    singapore or the 1963 federal constitution (see art 5(3)(b) of the constitution of the state of singapore).
168    under art 42(1) of the 1963 federal

                    constitution, the ruler or governor of a state (which, under s 5 of the

                    malaysia act, included the yang di-pertuan negara in singapore) had the power to

                    grant pardon in respect of all offences committed in his state, except offences

                    tried by court martial. under art 42(4)(b),

                    this power was to be exercised on the advice of a pardons board constituted for

                    that state. there was no provision expressly stating that the power to grant

                    pardon was exercisable by the yang di-pertuan negara acting in his personal

                    discretion.
(4)   the republic of singapore independence act 1965 (act 9

                of 1965) and art 22p 
169    when singapore left the federation on

                    singapore day (ie, 9 august 1965) and became

                    an independent sovereign republic, the singapore government retained the

                    constitution of the state of singapore and supplemented it with specific

                    articles from the 1963 federal constitution via the republic of singapore

                    independence act 1965 (act 9 of 1965) (referred to hereafter as

                    “act 9 of 1965” for short) (see evolution

                        of a revolution: forty years of the singapore constitution

                    (li-ann thio & kevin y l tan eds) (routledge-cavendish, 2009) at

                    p 1). this is not surprising in view of the fact that the constitution of

                    the state of singapore, as its very title

                    suggests, was incomplete at that particular point in time inasmuch as it was

                    intended for a state within a federation, and not

                    for a fully independent nation as such.
170    more significantly for the purposes of the

                    present appeal, act 9 of 1965 reserved to the president the power to grant

                    pardon as follows:

grant of pardon.

8.—(1) the

                        president, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the

                        cabinet —
(a)    grant a pardon

                                to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads

                                to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the

                                principal offenders, if more than one;
(b)    grant to any

                                offender convicted of any offence in any court in singapore, a

                                pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or

                                respite, either indefinite or for such period as the president may

                                think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such

                                offender; or
(c)    remit the whole

                                or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed

                                by law.
(2)    where any offender has been condemned to death by

                            the sentence of any court and in the event of an appeal such sentence

                            has been confirmed by the appellate court, the president shall cause the

                            reports which are made to him by the judge who tried the case and the

                            chief justice or other presiding judge of the appellate court to be

                            forwarded to the attorney-general with instructions that, after the

                            attorney-general has given his opinion thereon, the reports shall be

                            sent, together with the attorney-general’s opinion, to the cabinet

                            so that the cabinet may advise the president on the exercise of the

                            power conferred on him by subsection (1).
sections 8(1) and 8(2) of act 9 of 1965 were

                    subsequently reproduced as ss 8(1) and 8(2) of the republic of singapore

                    independence act 1965 (1985 rev ed) (“the

                rsia”).
171    sections 8(1) and 8(2) of act 9 of

                    1965/the rsia have since been incorporated, verbatim, into the singapore

                    constitution as arts 22p(1) and 22p(2) respectively (see halsbury’s laws of singapore vol 1 (lexisnexis,

                    2008 reissue) at para 10.843, fn 1). the specific procedure laid

                    down in art 22p(2) is the same as the procedure which has been adopted

                    since the 1958 order in council and the 1958 royal instructions came into force,

                        viz: the president (previously, the yang

                    di-pertuan negara) shall cause the report made to him by the trial judge and (in

                    the event of an appeal from the trial judge’s decision) the report made to

                    him by the presiding judge of the appellate court to be forwarded to the

                    attorney-general (previously, the state advocate-general) for the

                    attorney-general to provide his opinion thereon, and, thereafter, the aforesaid

                    report(s) shall be sent, together with the attorney-general’s opinion, to

                    the cabinet for its consideration so that it may advise the president on the

                    exercise of the clemency power.
172    mr ravi, in trying to make good his

                    argument on the discretion issue, traced the historical development of the

                    clemency power in this jurisdiction from the time when the clemency power was a

                    prerogative power exercisable by the governor of singapore and then the yang

                    di-pertuan negara right through to singapore day, when this power was enacted

                    via s 8 of act 9 of 1965. in the course of doing so, mr ravi referred

                    to the speech in parliament of the then prime minister, mr lee kuan yew

                    (“mr lee”), at the second reading of the bill to enact

                    act 9 of 1965 (viz, the republic of singapore

                    independence bill 1965 (bill 43 of 1965)

                    (“bill 43/1965”)), as follows (see singapore parliamentary debates, official report

                    (22 december 1965) vol 24 at col 439):
clause 8 [which later became s 8 of act 9 of 1965] invests

                        the power of pardon [i]n the president who will exercise

                            it in accordance with the advice of the cabinet. [emphasis

                        added]
173    nothing can be clearer than the above words

                    in showing that the clemency power, although exercised by and in the name of the

                    president, is to be exercised in accordance with

                    the advice of the cabinet. in this regard, it is also significant that the

                    explanatory statement to bill 43/1965 stated that “[t]he power of

                    pardon [was to be] made exercisable by the president on the

                        advice of the cabinet” [emphasis added]. mr ravi

                    cited mr lee’s speech in parliament at the second reading of

                    bill 43/1965 (“mr lee’s parliamentary speech on

                    bill 43/1965”) to support his argument (vis-à-vis the justiciability issue) that the clemency power was

                    subject to judicial review, but it failed to register in his mind that the same

                    statement completely undermined his other argument (vis-à-vis the discretion issue) that the president was not bound

                    by the advice of the cabinet in exercising the clemency power.
174    therefore, as the legislative history of the

                    clemency power in singapore clearly demonstrates, apart from ss 14 and 15

                    of the 1955 order in council and s 12 of the 1955 royal instructions (which

                    made it abundantly clear that the governor could act in his discretion according

                    to his own deliberate judgment when exercising the clemency power, albeit with

                    certain significant conditions (see above at [160]–[162])), none

                    of the legislative predecessors of art 22p since 1958 (when, significantly,

                    singapore was on the cusp of embarking on the incipient steps of its journey

                    towards full independence) expressly stated that the president could exercise

                    the clemency power acting in his discretion. the legislative history of the

                    clemency power in this jurisdiction indicates plainly that art 22p excludes

                    any role for the president’s personal discretion in the exercise of the

                    clemency power.
case law on the clemency power
175    let us now turn to the relevant case law on

                    the exercise of the clemency power which supports our conclusion that the

                    president has no discretion in exercising the clemency power. in the context of

                    the justiciability issue, mr ravi referred to two indian supreme court

                    decisions (viz, maru

                        ram and epuru sudhakar (see

                        [65]–[66] above)) as authorities in support of his argument that the

                    clemency power was not immune from judicial review. however, he appeared to have

                    overlooked the following passage from [61] of maru ram, which undermined

                    his argument, vis-à-vis the discretion issue, that

                    the president could act in his own discretion in exercising the clemency power

                    and was not bound by the advice of the cabinet. at [61] of maru ram, three members of

                    the court (namely, y v chandrachud cj,

                    p n bhagwati j and v r krishna iyer j) stated in

                    their joint judgment:
it is fundamental to the westminster system that the cabinet rules and the

                        queen reigns being too deeply rooted as foundational to our system no

                        serious encounter was met from the learned solicitor-general whose sure

                        grasp of fundamentals did not permit him to controvert the proposition, that

                            the president and the governor, be they ever so high

                            in textual terminology, are but functional euphemisms promptly acting on

                            andonlyon the advice of the council of ministers have in a

                            narrow area of power. the subject is now beyond controversy,

                        this court having authoritatively laid down the law in [samsher singh v state of punjab and another air 1974

                        sc 2192]. so, we agree, even without reference to article 367(1)

                        [of the indian constitution, which provides for the application of the

                        general clauses act 1897 (act no 10 of 1897) (india) to the

                        interpretation of the indian constitution] and sections 3(8)(b) and 3(60)(b) of the

                        general clauses act, 1897 [which define the terms “central

                        government” and “state government” respectively as used

                        in indian legislation], that, in the matter of exercise of the powers under

                        articles 72 and 161 [ie, the power vested

                        in, respectively, the president and the governor of a state to grant

                        clemency], the two highest dignitaries in our

                            constitutional scheme act and must act not on their own judgment but in

                            accordance with the aid and advice of the ministers.

                        article 74, after the 42nd amendment [which states that the president

                        shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with the advice

                        of the council of ministers] silences speculation and obligates compliance.

                        the governor vis-à-vis his cabinet is no higher than the president save in a

                        narrow area which does not include article 161. the

                            constitutional conclusion is that the governor is but a shorthand

                            expression for the state government and the president is an abbreviation

                            for the central government. [emphasis in original in italics;

176    in kehar singh and

                        another v union of india and another air 1989 sc 653

                        (“kehar singh”) (which

                    mr ravi did not cite to us), the supreme court of india (consisting of a

                    bench of five judges) said (at [7] per r s pathak cj):
the power to pardon is a part of the constitutional scheme … in the

                        indian republic. it has been reposed by the people through the constitution

                        in the head of the state, and enjoys high status. it is a constitutional

                        responsibility of great significance, to be exercised when occasion arises

                        in accordance with the discretion contemplated by the context. it is not

                        denied, and indeed it has been repeatedly affirmed in the course of argument

                        by [counsel for the petitioners] that the power to pardon rests on the

                        advice tendered by the executive to the president, who subject to the

                        provisions of art. 74(1) of the constitution, must act in accordance

                        with such advice. we may point out that the constitution bench of this court

                        held in [maru ram] that the

                            [clemency] power under art. 72 is to be exercised on the advice of

                            the central government and not by the president on his own, and that the

                            advice of the government binds the head of the state.

                        [emphasis added]
177    in our view, what was stated by the supreme

                    court of india in maru ram and kehar singh is elementary constitutional law that any student of

                    the subject must know, namely: under a constitution based on the westminster

                    model, like ours, the president is a constitutional head of state and must act

                    on the advice of the cabinet in the exercise of his executive powers, except for

                    those powers that, by express constitutional authority, he may exercise acting

                    in his discretion, such as the appointment of the prime minister and the

                    dissolution of parliament. this also brings us to the next factor which rebuts

                    mr ravi’s argument on the discretion issue, namely, the nature of the

                    president’s powers under our constitutional framework. specifically, what

                    we will examine below is whether the clemency power is one of the powers which

                    the singapore constitution permits the president to exercise in his

                    discretion.
the nature of the president’s powers under singapore’s

                constitutional framework
178    prior to the establishment of the elected

                    presidency via s 4 of the constitution of the republic of singapore

                    (amendment) act 1991 (act 5 of 1991), which came into effect on

                    30 november 1991, the position under our constitutional framework was that

                    “[t]he president was a constitutional head of state with very little

                    discretionary powers, save in the appointment of the prime minister and the

                    dissolution of parliament at the request of the prime minister” (see

                    kevin y l tan & thio li-ann, constitutional law in malaysia and singapore (lexisnexis,

                    3rd ed, 2010) at p 362; see also the authorities cited by chan cj

                    at [19] above). in contrast, after the

                    establishment of the elected presidency, the president was vested with certain

                    additional discretionary powers (“the additional discretionary

                    powers”). these are now specified in art 21(2) of the singapore

                    constitution (reproduced in the extract from [69] of the hc judgment quoted at [153] above), which explicitly declares that the president

                        “may act in his discretion”

                    [emphasis added] in exercising such powers. these words clearly serve to

                    distinguish the additional discretionary powers from the president’s

                    traditional pre-existing powers prior to the establishment of the elected

                    presidency, the latter powers being exercisable by the president only “in

                    accordance with the advice of the cabinet or of a minister acting under the

                    general authority of the cabinet” (see art 21(1)).
179    according to constitutional amendments to safeguard financial assets and the integrity

                        of the public services (white paper, cmd 10 of 1988,

                    29 july 1988), the purpose of conferring the additional discretionary

                    powers on the president was to enable him to “[protect] the

                    republic’s financial assets, and [preserve] the integrity of the public

                    services” (at para 20). in a subsequent white paper explaining the

                    proposed constitutional amendments to provide for the elected presidency,

                        safeguarding financial assets and the integrity of the

                        public services: the constitution of the republic of singapore (amendment

                        no 3) bill (cmd 11 of 1990, 27 august 1990), the

                    additional discretionary powers were summarised as follows:

summary of discretionary powers

48.    the president will

                            have the discretion to withhold concurrence to:
a.    the budgets of the government, and of key

                                government companies and statutory boards;
b.    any debt, guarantee or loan to be incurred,

                                given or raised by the government;
c.    certain appointments to office;
d.    requests to issue a proclamation of

                                emergency;
e.    detentions under the internal security act,

                                contrary to the recommendations of the advisory board;

                            and
f.    decisions by a minister under the maintenance

                                of religious harmony bill, contrary to the recommendations of the

                                presidential council for religious harmony.
49.    the president can also authorise director cpib to

                            carry out any inquiries or investigations into a minister if the prime

                            minister had withheld consent to such investigations.
the power to pardon is conspicuously absent from this list of

                    personal discretionary powers. this is manifestly understandable, given that

                    that power is not a power or function which is related to the president’s

                    ultimate duty of protecting singapore’s financial assets and preserving

                    the integrity of the public services.
180    in the light of all these considerations, on

                    a plain reading of the singapore constitution, the president may not exercise

                    the clemency power acting in his personal discretion. instead, the clemency

                    power falls under the default position with regard to the president’s

                    powers as stated in art 21(1), ie:

                    “the president shall … act in accordance with the advice of the

                    cabinet or of a minister acting under the general authority of the

                    cabinet”. thus, the president may only exercise the clemency power in

                    favour of an offender in circumstances where the cabinet has advised him to do

                    so. where the cabinet has advised him not to grant a pardon, there is no

                    provision under either art 22p or elsewhere in the singapore constitution

                    that confers upon the president the power to act in his own personal discretion

                    contrary to the advice of the cabinet.
summary of our views on mr ravi’s argument on the

                discretion issue
181    the four factors analysed above –

                    namely, the wording of art 22p, the legislative history of the clemency

                    power in this jurisdiction, case law on the clemency power and the nature of the

                    president’s powers under our constitutional framework – demonstrate

                    the fallacy of mr ravi’s argument on the discretion issue (ie, that the president may exercise the clemency power

                    in his own discretion and is not bound by the cabinet’s advice). what

                    undermined this argument completely was that mr ravi himself rebutted it

                    (albeit unwittingly) when he read to us mr lee’s parliamentary speech

                    on bill 43/1965 in the mistaken belief that that speech supported his

                    argument (see [172]-[173] above). in this regard, we would caution that whilst

                    counsel has unfettered licence to raise all arguable points of law in support of

                    a client’s case, it is improper for counsel to make an obviously hopeless

                    argument (ie, an argument which any reasonable

                    lawyer would know is bound to fail), especially if he advances the argument for

                    an extraneous purpose. such conduct may (depending on the facts in question)

                    amount to a serious abuse of process, even if it occurs in a situation where

                    counsel is acting for a client in a case of the utmost gravity for the client,

                    as in the present case.
the legitimate expectation issue
182    having dealt with the discretion issue, we

                    now turn to the related matter of the legitimate expectation issue. as pointed

                    out by chan cj at [23] above,

                    mr ravi raised the legitimate expectation issue only in the course of his

                    oral submissions before this court, and did not give advance notice to the

                    respondent even though he knew beforehand that he was going to bring up the

                    issue. he claimed that, as in the case of his objection to chan cj’s

                    hearing this appeal, it did not occur to him until very late in the day that the

                    legitimate expectation issue was an issue which “would be that

                    full mr ravi’s argument on the legitimate expectation issue as set

                    out in the “first speaking note on behalf of the appellant”

                    (“the first speaking note”):
14.    further, a

                            legitimate expectation has arisen to the effect that it is the president

                            who will make the clemency

                            decision.
15.    it is

                            well-established that: “where a public authority has issued a

                            promise or adopted a practice which represents how it proposes to act in

                            a given area, the law will require the promise or practice to be

                            honoured unless there is good reason not to do so”: nadarajah v secretary of state for the home

                                department[2005] ewca civ 1363 at [68]. this

                            principle is in the interests of “good administration” and

                            such expectations may “go beyond enforceable legal rights,

                            provided they have some reasonable basis”: attorney general v ng yuen shiu[1983] 2 w.l.r. 735 at 638f (privy

                            council).
16.    the legitimate

                            expectation in the present case derives from two

                            sources.
17.    in the first place,

                            the respondent himself in the present proceedings has accepted that

                            “in theory it is the president who exercises the prerogative of

                            mercy” (exhibit mr-3 at

                            [31])[.]
18.    in additions

                                [sic], reliance is placed on the

                            following newspaper articles relating to the clemency power (emphasis

                            added):
a.    “reprieve

                                a drug case …

                                    cheong.
19.    in relation to these articles it is important to

                            note that the straits times is under the

                            direct control of the government and therefore its contents constitute

                            statements of state practice authorised by the government. as a result,

                            and in accordance with the principle of legitimate expectation, the law

                            will require the state to abide by its repeatedly expressed statement of

                            practice that the clemency decision is to be taken by the president, and

                            not the cabinet.
[underlining and emphasis in bold in original]
184    it is unnecessary for us to discuss at

                    length the law in singapore as regards legitimate expectations for the purposes

                    of dealing with mr ravi’s argument on the legitimate expectation

                    issue. this is because mr ravi himself destroyed his own case on this issue

                    when, in contradiction of his stance that the appellant had a legitimate

                    expectation that the clemency power would be exercised by the president in his

                    discretion, he read out to us a newspaper article (viz, sue-ann chia, “drug trafficker asks for

                    clemency”

                    the straits times (19 march 2005) at

                    p 42), in which president s r nathan

                    (“president nathan”) was reported to have said:
… it is the cabinet that considers all the factors involved before

                        making a decision on [a] plea for clemency …
… i am constitutionally bound to adhere to the rules of [the]

                        cabinet and [its] recommendations. …
by the above statements, president nathan was clearly reiterating

                    to the public the constitutional position that he was under a duty to act in

                    accordance with the advice of the cabinet in exercising the power of clemency,

                    and had no discretion in the matter, even if he personally wished to grant

                    clemency to an offender. in view of president nathan’s statements, it

                    was impossible for mr ravi to argue that the appellant had a legitimate

                    expectation that the president would do what he had said he could not do, ie, exercise the

                    clemency power in his discretion.
185    indeed, we found mr ravi’s

                    argument on the legitimate expectation issue to be absolutely without merit,

                    both on the facts and on the law. with regard to

                    the facts relied on by mr ravi (ie, the

                    newspaper reports mentioned at para 18 of the first speaking note), those

                    newspaper reports do not in any way show that the president or the cabinet

                    previously promised the public that the clemency power would be exercised by the

                    president in his discretion, as opposed to on the cabinet’s advice. none

                    of the aforesaid newspaper reports conveys a representation or promise of any

                    kind, whether by the president or the cabinet, other than a representation of

                    fact that, as reported, an offender had been granted clemency.

                    mr ravi’s contention that “the straits

                        times is under the direct control of the government and therefore

                    its contents constitute statements of state practice authorised by the

                        government”[note: 26] clearly rests on misconceived

                    assumptions of the relationship between the press and the elected government in

                    singapore. thus, any purported expectation on the appellant’s part that

                    the president exercises the clemency power in his own discretion is neither

                    legitimate nor well founded.
186    apropos the law on legitimate expectations,

                    for an alleged legitimate expectation to give rise to enforceable legal rights,

                    it is not enough that the alleged expectation exists; it must, in addition, be

                    legitimate. an expectation is legitimate only if it is founded upon a promise or

                    practice by a public authority that can be said to be bound to fulfil the

                    expectation. clear statutory words will override any expectation (see the house

                    of lords decision of regina v director of public

                        prosecutions, ex parte kebilene and others [2000] 2 ac 326

                    at 368 per lord steyn). in this regard, we

                    have demonstrated above (at [156]–[157]) that it

                    is clear from the words “on the advice of the cabinet” in

                    art 22p(1) that the president cannot possibly make any promise to an

                    offender that he will act in his discretion in deciding whether or not to grant

                    clemency to that offender.
187    in short, mr ravi has failed to show,

                    both on the facts and on the law, that the expectation relied on by the

                    appellant exists. that expectation existed only as a theoretical argument

                    advanced by mr ravi. it is devoid of any merit, and we reject it. we are

                    also minded to observe that the lack of even a scintilla of legal substance in

                    mr ravi’s submissions on this issue (as well as on the discretion

                    issue), coupled with the manner in which the submissions were made, borders on

                    an abuse of process.
the other issues arising in this appeal
188    the other issues in this appeal which we

                    have to decide are the justiciability issue, the natural justice issue, the

                    disclosure issue and the declaratory relief issue (see [15] and [144] above). with

                    regard to all these four issues, we agree with chan cj’s carefully

                    reasoned judgment. we would only add a few observations of our

                own.
189    

          vis-à-vis the

                    declaratory relief issue, as chan cj pointed out at [25] above, o 53 of the rules of court does

                    not provide for declaratory relief (see also [143] above). accordingly, the declaration sought by the

                    appellant (reproduced at [143] above) was a

                    non-starter from the outset, and the same applies to all the other reliefs

                    prayed for in os 740/2010 which are dependent on that declaration being

                    granted.
190    in so far as the justiciability issue is

                    concerned, we agree with chan cj that the clemency power is subject to

                    judicial review if it is exercised contrary to the chng suan

                        tze principle as elaborated on in phyllis

                        tan (see [80]

                above).
191    with respect to the natural justice issue,

                    we agree with chan cj that the rule against bias applies to the clemency

                    process in principle, whereas the hearing rule does not (see, respectively,

                        [111] and [113] above). we would also point out that, given the nature of

                    the clemency power, the cabinet, when advising the president on the exercise of

                    this power, cannot be held to the same standard of impartiality and objectivity

                    as that applicable to a court of law or a tribunal exercising a quasi-judicial

                    function. all that is required of the cabinet is that it must abide by the

                    process set out in art 22p, and must give its consideration fairly and

                    objectively to the matter at hand, having regard to the purpose of the clemency

                    power.
192    in this regard, it is important to bear in

                    mind that the grant of clemency is an act of grace on the part of the ultimate

                    authority. that being so, the cabinet, in advising the president (the ultimate

                    authority in our local context) on whether or not to grant clemency in a

                    particular case, is entitled to take into account the public policy

                    considerations concerning the nature of the offence in question and the

                    legislative policy underlying the imposition of the prescribed punishment for

                    that offence. the cabinet is not expected to ignore these policy considerations,

                    and its conduct in giving effect to such considerations by advising the

                    president not to grant clemency in a particular case cannot, without more,

                    amount to bias, whether actual or apparent.
193    with respect to the disclosure issue, as

                    noted by chan cj, mr ravi relied heavily on the disclosure holding in

                        lewis (as defined at [129] above) to support the argument that the appellant should

                    be given disclosure of the art 22p(2) materials relating to his case so

                    that he can make adequate representations to the president on any fresh clemency

                    petition which he may wish to file. one of the reasons underlying the disclosure

                    holding in lewis was the concern of the majority

                    in lewis that the advisory body which was to

                    advise the ultimate authority on the exercise of the clemency power might act

                    “in an arbitrary or perverse way … or … in an improper,

                    unreasonable way” (see lewis at

                76).
194    apropos the aforesaid risk, we agree with

                    chan cj that it would be unjustifiable for our courts to regard it as a

                    factor favouring mr ravi’s argument on the disclosure issue, given

                    the constitutional standing of the persons involved in the clemency process in

                    our local context. indeed, in our view, it would be not only unjustifiable, but

                    also wholly improper for our courts to be influenced by this risk. anything is

                    possible, but the courts should not give countenance to fanciful fears of unfair

                    or unjust practices in the exercise of the clemency power when there is not a

                    single iota of evidence to warrant such fears – which is the position in

                    the present case. mr ravi’s argument apropos the aforesaid risk is

                    pure conjecture without any factual foundation whatsoever. in this connection,

                    we would also refer to the decision of the supreme court of india in maru ram at [62]

                    (reproduced at, inter alia, [65] above) which mr ravi relied on to

                    support his argument on the justiciability issue. it would appear that, as in

                    the case of his reliance on mr lee’s parliamentary speech on

                    bill 43/1965 to support his argument on the discretion issue (see [172], [173]

                    and [181] above), mr ravi overlooked

                    the following sentence in the concurring judgment of fazal ali j, which

                    undermined his argument on the disclosure issue (see maru

                        ram at [94]):
it cannot be doubted as a proposition of law that where a power is vested

                        in a very high authority, it must be presumed that the said authority would

                        act properly and carefully after an objective consideration of all the

                        aspects of the matter.
195    in our view, it is clear that the decision

                    of the majority in lewis (viz, that the offender in a death sentence case is entitled to

                    the full disclosure of all the materials placed before the advisory body tasked

                    with advising the ultimate authority on the exercise of the clemency power) was

                    based on considerations which have no application here. on the other hand, the

                    decisions of the privy council in de freitas and

                        reckley (viz,

                    that there is no such right of disclosure for the offender in a death sentence

                    case) were based on considerations which continue to be applicable here. we

                    agree with chan cj that the appellant is not entitled to disclosure of the

                    art 22p(2) materials relating to his case because an offender seeking

                    clemency has no constitutional right of hearing during the clemency process and

                    does not even have the constitutional right to present a clemency petition

                    (although, as pointed out by chan cj (at [114] above), in practice, an offender in a death sentence case

                    is always given the opportunity to present, if he wishes, a clemency petition to

                    the president for consideration under art 22p).
conclusion
196    for the reasons given above, like

                    chan cj, we are of the view that this appeal has no merit and we dismiss

                    it. there will be no order as to costs, having regard to the subject matter of

                    this appeal.
