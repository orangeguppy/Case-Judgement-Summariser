 at the hearing of each of these applications, hpk (represented by mr ho) was again given the opportunity to address the court of appeal. these applications were dismissed by the court of appeal.9 the costs in the costs order were eventually taxed on 23 august 2016. hpk and mr ho filed an application to set aside the taxation and in the alternative, to obtain an extension of time to apply for a review of the taxation. this was dismissed on 3 may 2017.

10 on 24 may 2017, mr ho filed os 563 seeking to be added as a party to s 36/2006 and to set aside the costs order. while os 563 was underway, the attorney-general (the “ag”) applied pursuant to s 74 of the supreme court of judicature act (cap 322, 2007 rev ed) (“scja”) to restrain mr ho (and hpk) from continuing proceedings connected with s 36/2006 on the basis that mr ho was a vexatious litigant. mr ho consented to the ag’s application and a consent order was recorded (“the vexatious litigant order”).11 as a result of the vexatious litigant order, mr ho required leave of court to continue with os 563. he therefore applied ex parte for such leave and his application was granted by chan seng onn j (“chan j”).

 12 on 29 january 2018, os 563 was heard and dismissed by the judge. because of the vexatious litigant order, mr ho also needed to obtain leave of court before he could appeal against the judge’s dismissal of os 563. mr ho again applied ex parte for such leave and it was granted by chan j on 13 march 2018.

 13 on 28 march 2018, about a month after his time to appeal against os 563 had lapsed, mr ho filed his current application before us seeking an extension of time to file and serve his notice of appeal.our decision14 a court faced with an application for extension of time should consider four factors: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; (c) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing were extended; and (d) the prejudice caused to the would-be respondent if an extension of time was in fact granted: see lee hsien loong v singapore democratic party and others and another suit [2008] 1 slr(r) 757 (“lee hsien loong”) at [28].15 on the facts of this case, the primary consideration was whether mr ho’s intended appeal against os 563 was so hopeless that granting an extension of time would really be an exercise in futility and a waste of time and costs. in our view, os 563 had no chance of success.16 although counsel for mr ho raised several issues before us and in os 563, his main contention was that mr ho was not given an opportunity to address the court on 2 august 2010 on the costs order before it was made as he was not a party to the proceedings in s 36/2006.

  applicant’s skeletal submissions in os 563, dated 23 january 2018, at paras 8–9 and 23; applicant’s skeletal submissions for the applicant’s application for extension of time to file and serve notice of appeal in os 9/2018 (“mr ho’s os 9 submissions”), dated 10 may 2018, at paras 8–9 and 33.



 in fact, mr ho claimed that he had notice of the costs order only as late as 23 august 2016 when costs were taxed. 17 mr ho’s claims could not be correct. he would have been the person instructing hpk’s counsel at the hearing on costs on 2 august 2010 and he did not allege that his then counsel failed to inform him about the costs order after it was made by the judge. mr ho was not only present at the 11 july 2014 hearing concerning the costs order, he also represented hpk. it is plain to us that mr ho was aware of the costs order by 11 july 2014 at the latest.18 the documentary evidence on record – including mr ho’s own affidavits filed in support of hpk’s subsequent successive applications to challenge the costs order – proved this to be so. in his affidavit dated 21 july 2014, mr ho detailed exchanges between himself and the court of appeal at the 11 july 2014 hearing. at that hearing, mr ho addressed the court of appeal on why he should not be made personally liable for costs. the suspended costs order was explained to mr ho and was then restored. on at least three further occasions after 11 july 2014, mr ho had the opportunity to ventilate his case on the costs order before the court of appeal. there could therefore be no doubt that mr ho had notice of the costs order by 11 july 2014 at the latest and had been heard on the same issue several times. indeed, many of the grounds raised before us appeared to have similarly been raised before the court of appeal on those prior occasions.19 mr ho’s application in os 563 was merely another attempt to re-open the proceedings in s 36/2006 and the court of appeal’s decision on the costs order. such matters have long been concluded. in our view, the judge was therefore entirely justified in dismissing os 563. mr ho’s appeal against the judge’s dismissal of os 563 would ultimately be a non-starter. accordingly, we dismissed his application.observations on the ex parte proceedings20 before we conclude, we think it is useful to address one other point canvassed by counsel for mr ho. as mr ho was subject to the vexatious litigant order, he had to satisfy the high court that his intended proceedings were not an abuse of process of the court and that there was a prima facie ground for the proceedings: s 74(1)(b) of the scja. it was submitted that since mr ho had succeeded in obtaining leave to continue proceedings in the two applications before chan j, os 563 could not be an abuse of process and had a prima facie chance of success.

  mr ho’s os 9 submissions, at paras 15 and 24; see also ho soo fong’s affidavit in os 9/2018, dated 28 march 2018, at paras 26 and 29.



21 mr ho’s applications were made ex parte, in revitech’s absence. the court’s attention was not brought to the fact that mr ho had had the opportunity to address the court of appeal on multiple occasions on the merits of the costs order. mr ho’s affidavits and submissions before chan j claimed that he had notice of the costs order only on 23 august 2016, which, as shown above, could not be correct. they made no mention of the 11 july 2014 hearing or his three applications thereafter to set aside, stay and vary the costs order. other than a cursory reference to mr ho’s affidavit filed in os 563, which in turn made passing reference to the court of appeal’s reinstatement of the costs order, none of the materials either directly or indirectly explained that the court of appeal had considered and upheld the costs order after submissions were made on whether mr ho should be made to pay costs personally. had the full history of the proceedings been brought to the court’s attention, leave to continue might not have been granted as os 563 and the intended appeal from its dismissal would be frivolous and completely hopeless in merit.  in those circumstances, mr ho could not rely on the ex parte proceedings as evidence of the merits of his proposed appeal from os 563. conclusion22 for the above reasons we dismissed the present application with costs. after hearing the parties on costs, we ordered mr ho to pay revitech costs fixed at $3,300 inclusive of disbursements, which is the amount that revitech asked for. we also made the usual consequential orders on the security for costs.tay yong kwang        belinda ang saw eanjudge of appeal   judgeyong zhee hoe (surian & partners) for the applicant;ong xin ying samantha (wnlex llc) for the respondent. annex: chronology of eventss/nodateevent1 24 january 2006hpk files writ of summons against revitech in s 36/20062 9 to 20 october 2006first tranche of s 36/20063 21 to 24 may 2007second tranche of s 36/2006 heard before lai j (as she then was)4 13 november 2007lai j delivers judgment for second tranche of s 36/2006; no appeal was filed5 6 january to 28 september 2009third tranche of s 36/2006 heard before lai j6 8 april 2010lai j delivers judgment for third tranche of s 36/2006, reserving the issue of costs 7 5 may 2010hpk files notice of appeal against the merits of lai j’s decision in the third tranche (ca 74/2010)8 1 august 2010revitech files written submissions seeking costs order against ho personally on indemnity basis9 2 august 2010costs hearing for s 36/2006, lai j issues the costs order against ho personally if hpk unwilling or unable to pay10 30 september 2010court of appeal hears ca 74 and reserves the costs order pending assessment of liability and damages11 20 august 2013hpk’s counsel indicates that hpk not participating in assessment of liability and damages12 3 october 2013revitech extracts the costs order in orc 6837/201313 29 october 2013assessment of liability and damages hearing pursuant to ca 74 without hpk’s participation, resulting in damages in favour of revitech14 23 january 2014hpk’s counsel mr edwin lee (eldan law llp) discharges himself15 28 may 2014revitech files written submissions requesting for ho to be appointed to represent hpk before the court of appeal for ca 74 for reinstatement of costs order16 30 may 2014hearing before court of appeal on costs order adjourned17 11 july 2014court of appeal hearing on costs order, costs order reinstated18 21 july 2014ho files sum 3656 to set aside the court of appeal’s decision to reinstate the costs order19 1 october 2014court of appeal hears and dismisses sum 365620 12 december 2014ho files sum 6346 to stay the execution of the costs order21 12 february 2015court of appeal hears and dismisses sum 634622 12 august 2015ho files sum 210 to vary the decisions in s 36/2006 and ca 7423 9 september 2015court of appeal hears and dismisses sum 21024 22 june 2015court of appeal delivers judgment in agq v attorney-general and another appeal [2015] 4 slr 760, wherein ho and hpk had taken out suit against the government of singapore25 23 august 2016costs order taxed at $249,600 (with disbursements of $126,414.92) in bc 152/201026 24 may 2017ho files os 563 to add himself as party to s 36/2006 and to set aside the costs order27 4 august 2017the ag files os 892 seeking to prevent ho and hpk from continuing proceedings related to s 36/2006 without leave of the high court28 11 october 2017ho consents to the vexatious litigant order29 7 november 2017ho files ex parte os 1220 to seek leave to pursue os 563, which is subsequently granted30 29 january 2018os 563 is heard and dismissed by lai sj31 22 february 2018ho files ex parte os 223 to institute an appeal against os 56332 13 march 2018leave is granted in os 22333 21 march 2018order granting leave in os 223 is extracted34 28 march 2018ho files os 9 seeking extension of time to file notice of appeal
