2 Mr Ng claims that although the BOC account was in their joint names, and the money in it came from the sale proceeds of a property that was also in their joint names, he was the sole beneficial owner of the property and the money in the bank account. Accordingly, he contended that Mdm Thum was not entitled to any of the money that she took.Background3 Mr Ng and Mdm Thum (now in their 80s) were in a romantic relationship for over 40 years – from the 1970s until the relationship soured towards the end of 2019.

Specifically, Mdm Thum says that she only came to know of Mr Ng’s wife and children some years later, when they turned up at the Sennett Lane home of Mr Ng and Mdm Thum (a linked bungalow bought in Mr Ng and Mdm Thum’s joint names)

 – I will deal with this at [53]–[63] below. By the end of 2014, the time deposits in the BOC account had been reduced to a total of $1,550,004.38.

 There is a small difference between what Mdm Thum withdrew and the time deposits that remained in the account, and they do not add up to the preceding balance of $1,532,140.94 (but instead, the lower figure of $1,522,615.07). That difference is likely due to Mdm Thum withdrawing interest and/or the incurring of bank charges reducing the remaining balance. For instance, the BOC statement dated 31 December 2014 shows that in 2014, $27,002.32 was paid in interest.

 Furthermore, in withdrawing $762,000 from the BOC account, on 9 March 2020 a $1,019,595.05 deposit was withdrawn ahead of maturity (the maturity date was 13 August 2020),

 for which charges may have been incurred. The parties did not make an issue of these differences, and I accept that what Mdm Thum withdrew from the BOC account represented half of the balance that was then in the account – she explained that she had sought the branch manager’s assistance to divide the balance 50-50.

 That is slightly less than the $762,000 which Mdm Thum had withdrawn earlier that month, but the parties made no issue of this. Again, the difference is likely due to interest and/or bank charges. When Mr Ng withdrew the remaining money from the BOC account and closed it, he would have terminated all of the time deposits ahead of maturity.

 Thus, from the time Mdm Thum withdrew the disputed $762,000 from the BOC account on 9 March 2020, Mr Ng withdrew slightly more from the two accounts ($766,466.62, being $761,048.42 plus $5,418.20).The parties’ positions10 Mr Ng’s claim to the $762,000 withdrawn by Mdm Thum rests on two contentions:

The evidence13 Mr Ng and Mdm Thum were the main witnesses in this case. There was some contemporaneous documentary evidence, but it was not complete. Family members of Mr Ng and Mdm Thum gave evidence on aspects of the matter, as did their next-door neighbour from Sennett Lane.14 I generally preferred Mdm Thum’s evidence to Mr Ng’s. Mdm Thum’s testimony was more consistent with her own pleadings and Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”). Her evidence was also more consistent with the documentary evidence. Crucially, the documentary evidence contradicts Mr Ng’s version of events as to how the Sennett Lane Property came to be in joint names, and how the BOC account came to be in joint names. I do, however, have some difficulties with aspects of Mdm Thum’s evidence, such as the significance of loans from her family members, and whether any of the money from the BOC account had gone towards Mdm Thum’s purchase of a flat at Pine Close in 2014 (the “Pine Close Flat”). I elaborate below.FindingsThe Sennett Lane Property15 An analysis of the parties’ interests in the Sennett Lane Property and its sale proceeds must start with their relationship, which had begun prior to the purchase of the property.Mr Ng and Mdm Thum’s relationship, and the business of Seacon Trading Company16 It is common ground that Mr Ng and Mdm Thum met in or around 1971,

Instead, he was content to stay on with Mdm Thum at the Sennett Lane Property (which continued to be in their names as joint tenants), while his wife and children moved out to stay elsewhere.39 Conspicuously, although Mr Ng contends that Mdm Thum was a co-owner in name only,

 he does not give any reason why she was named as a co-owner, or why she was named as a co-owner instead of his wife.

 This is consistent with Mr Ng’s inaction when confronted with his wife’s and children’s unhappiness regarding the manner in which the property was held. The parties’ interests in the Sennett Lane Property40 Both parties used the analytical framework in Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“Chan Yuen Lan”), which I apply in the present case. 41 The first step in the Chan Yuen Lan framework is to ask if there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property (Chan Yuen Lan at [160(a)]). The answer to that is “no”. As I stated above at [29], I consider that both Mr Ng and Mdm Thum made financial contributions to the purchase price of the property. However, I cannot discern the exact proportions of their respective financial contributions based on the available evidence. Accordingly, there is no presumption of resulting trust (that they hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price). It will thus be presumed instead that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the Sennett Lane Property in the same manner in which the legal interest is held. Here, the legal interest was held on a joint tenancy, and it is therefore presumed that Mr Ng and Mdm Thum held the Sennett Lane Property on a beneficial joint tenancy (see Damodaran s/o Subbarayan v Rogini w/o Subbarayan [2020] 5 SLR 1409 (“Damodaran”) at [33]–[34]).42 Moving to the second step, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in the first step (Chan Yuen Lan at [160(b)])? The answer to that is “no”. I find in the present case that the parties intended to hold the Sennett Lane Property as beneficial joint tenants, ie, it was jointly owned in their lifetime not in any particular proportion (unless that joint ownership were severed), with the property going to the survivor in the event of the death of one of them (see [39] above). As the answers to both the first and second steps are “no”, it follows that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the Sennett Lane Property in the same manner as that in which they hold the legal interest, ie, as beneficial joint tenants (Chan Yuen Lan at [160(c)]).43 If, as Mr Ng contended, the loans Mdm Thum procured from her family members were only extended after the Sennett Lane Property had been fully paid for, that would nevertheless be relevant in considering the parties’ intentions regarding the Sennett Lane Property at the time it was sold in or around 2011. Whatever the situation at the time the property was acquired, the parties could have a subsequent express or inferred common intention as to how they hold the beneficial interest in the property (Chan Yuen Lan at [160(f)]).44 In the present case, the Sennett Lane Property was held as a beneficial joint tenancy from the time of acquisition, and events after the purchase do not point to a change in the parties’ intention. On the contrary, Mdm Thum continued to contribute to Seacon (including by procuring loans from her family members for Seacon), and I accept that she did so in the belief (which Mr Ng shared) that Seacon was their business; and that the Sennett Lane Property which was purchased with money from Seacon was their property. The UOB account45 The Sennett Lane Property was sold in or around 2011, and the net sale proceeds of $3,738,796.99 were deposited into the UOB joint account of Mr Ng and Mdm Thum.

46 Absent evidence to the contrary, the sale proceeds of a property held on a joint tenancy would continue to be held by the co-owners as joint tenants. In particular, where those proceeds are deposited into a joint account, the co-owners continue to be joint tenants of the chose in action for the balance proceeds in the account: see Zeligs Estate v Janes [2015] BCJ No 9 (“Zeligs (SC)”) at [176]–[178].47 Here, the UOB joint account had already been opened before the net sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property were received: the January 2012 bank statement shows that there was a balance of $5,325.15 on 1 January 2012 and the net sale proceeds were then deposited on 9 January 2012.

 However, he was evidently unconcerned about Mdm Thum remaining a joint account holder of the UOB account after the sale proceeds were received, which still held over $350,000 at the end of January 2012 – he took no steps to remove Mdm Thum as a joint account holder of the UOB account. This stands in stark contrast to the cautious attitude Mr Ng claims he had in relation to Seacon’s account – he says he had not named Mdm Thum as a joint account holder out of fear that problems would arise if the relationship soured.

59 The simple truth is that the BOC account was in joint names from the time it was opened, and Mr Ng’s story is just a concoction to improve his case for claiming that all of the money in the BOC account was his.60 Part of Mr Ng’s story is that he did not include his eldest son’s name as a joint account holder of the BOC account as Mr Ng wanted to surprise him and his other children by giving the $2m to them at an appropriate time and “to seek atonement for [his] moral wrongness in having an affair with [Mdm Thum].”

62 There is no truth in Mr Ng’s story that he wanted to surprise his children later with the money in the BOC account and seek their forgiveness for his moral wrongdoing. He did not consider that there was any moral wrongdoing to seek forgiveness for. The evidence shows that he had already given his children what he wanted to in January 2012 (ie, $100,000 each to three of them and nothing to the remaining one). Mr Ng’s true intention (which was a common intention shared with Mdm Thum) was that the money in the BOC account was meant for Mr Ng and Mdm Thum in their lifetime, with the money going to the survivor upon the death of either of them, ie, the money in the BOC account was held on a joint tenancy.63 There is also no truth in Mr Ng’s story about procuring some undertaking from Mdm Thum as a pre-condition for her being added as a joint account holder of the BOC account.

 Mdm Thum was a joint account holder of the BOC account from the time it was opened; she was not added later.64 Moreover, I do not believe that Mr Ng sought, or that Mdm Thum gave, any undertaking at any point in time. In particular, Mdm Thum did not: (a) acknowledge that she was a joint account holder of the BOC account in name only;(b) acknowledge that she had not contributed any money in the BOC account;(c) acknowledge that the money in the BOC account belonged solely to Mr Ng; or(d) undertake not to draw out any money from the BOC account on the understanding that the money was reserved for the future of Mr Ng’s children.65 I accept Mdm Thum’s evidence that money was withdrawn from the BOC account for expenses, as well as for transfers back to the UOB account.

 This indicates that the parties had intended the balance for the time being in those accounts to be held by them as joint tenants. 66 In the circumstances, I find that the money in the BOC account, like the Sennett Lane Property and the money in the UOB account, was held by Mr Ng and Mdm Thum as beneficial joint tenants. The balance in the BOC account came from the sale proceeds of the Sennet Lane Property, which Mr Ng and Mdm Thum had held as beneficial joint tenants, and they continued to be beneficial joint tenants of the balance in the BOC account, until the events of March 2020.Money for Mdm Thum’s purchase of the Pine Close Flat67 Besides the $1,000,000 paid to Mdm Thum in January 2012, and the $762,000 withdrawn by Mdm Thum from the BOC account, had Mdm Thum also received from the net sale proceeds a further sum of money from Mr Ng that was used towards Mdm Thum’s purchase of the Pine Close Flat? Mr Ng pleaded that Mdm Thum had received a sum of about $500,000 for the purpose of purchasing the Pine Close Flat (which he later changed to $520,000 in his testimony),

69 I have some difficulty with Mdm Thum’s evidence on this.70 Given that she only worked as a secretary in ICB for some 10 years (in the 1960s-1970s), after which she worked for Seacon for no remuneration, it is unlikely for her to have saved up $500,000 from her employment. That amount of savings is also unlikely even if I were to include her earnings from trading on her own account. Moreover, Mdm Thum’s own evidence that she had occasionally used her savings and profits from her own trades for Seacon’s working capital makes it all the more unlikely that she could have accumulated a further $500,000 in savings (on top of what she contributed to Seacon).

 As a comparison, the Sennett Lane Property was purchased for just $160,000; and when Seacon’s overdraft with Maybank was settled from the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property, the outstanding amount on that overdraft was only $220,000.

 It is improbable that Mdm Thum could have managed to save $500,000 during that period – an amount which would have been sufficient then to purchase the Sennett Lane Property three times over, with money to spare. 71 For Mdm Thum to have had $500,000 in savings is also incongruous with her needing to procure loans from her family members to help Seacon. 72 Mdm Thum testified that of the $1m she received in January 2012 from the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property, she only used $200,000 towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat. She said that some of the remaining $800,000 went towards settling loans given by her relatives (other than Mr Goh’s loan, which was directly settled from the sale proceeds), some went towards reimbursing her for money that she had put into Seacon, some went towards paying for her daily expenses, and the rest was kept by her as savings for her old age.

 But her case is that no part of this $800,000 balance went towards purchasing the Pine Close Flat: only $200,000 of the $1m went towards that. Mdm Thum’s position, however, means that she would have needed a further $500,000 (or thereabouts) to purchase the Pine Close Flat (which she says came from her savings).73 Mr Ng’s position on the $500,000 is not without difficulty either.

 Mr Ng said that in March 2020 (when Mdm Thum withdrew the disputed $762,000 from the BOC account), he expected the BOC account to have a balance sum of at least $2m. However, after deducting from the net sale proceeds of $3,738,796.99 the payments of $1m to Mdm Thum, $300,000 (in total) to three of Mr Ng’s children, $38,000 to Mdm Thum’s nephew Mr Goh, and $2m for placement as time deposits with BOC, there would only be some $400,000 left. Mr Ng could not have given Mdm Thum $500,000 for her to purchase the Pine Close Flat, whilst still leaving $2m intact in the BOC account.74 Mr Ng initially seemed to suggest in his AEIC that he had withdrawn about $500,000 from the UOB account for Mdm Thum to use in purchasing the Pine Close Flat,

 but this is contradicted by the UOB bank statements. As I noted above at [50], the UOB bank account had a balance of $352,190.68 after various payments were made out of the account in January 2012. The bank statements indicate that $1m was withdrawn (in four withdrawals of $250,000 each) – that went to Mdm Thum, but there is nothing to show that a further $500,000 went to Mdm Thum. The balance of $352,190.68 was insufficient to support a withdrawal of about $500,000 for Mdm Thum’s use thereafter.75 In his testimony, Mr Ng then said that he had given Mdm Thum a sum of about $520,000 which had come from the BOC account, not the UOB account.

 He said that there was a placement of a $480,000 time deposit, which is what remained of an original $1m time deposit, and that showed that he had withdrawn $520,000 for Mdm Thum to use to buy the Pine Close Flat. The documents do not, however, reflect the $480,000 time deposit that Mr Ng mentioned. The four time deposits listed in the BOC statement dated 31 December 2014 are:

 is that the time deposits totalling $2m when the BOC account was opened on 11 January 2012 had been reduced to time deposits totalling $1,550,004.38 by the end of 2014 – a reduction of around $450,000. The 31 December 2014 statement also shows that $27,002.32 was paid as interest in the year 2014. If the interest paid in 2012 (from 11 January 2012 onwards) and 2013 was comparable, it would mean that by the end of 2014, there had been a net withdrawal of around $500,000 from the BOC account.77 Mdm Thum made various withdrawals from the BOC account in the course of 2014: cashier’s orders for $24,400, $580,000, and $25,000, and cash withdrawals of $22,534.38 and $25,010.14.

 78 The BOC statement of 31 December 2014 indicates that by the end of 2014, one of the $1m time deposits was simply renewed on 11 January 2014 (the anniversary of the original placement on 11 January 2012), yet the other $1m time deposit had become three-time deposits totalling just $550,004.38 (making a total balance of $1,550,004.38). Put another way, it appears that not all of the $676,944.52 withdrawn by Mdm Thum in 2014 (supposedly for the purpose of renewals and placements of time deposits) was deposited back into the BOC account.79 2014 is a significant year because the title search on the Pine Close Flat shows that the contract date for Mdm Thum’s purchase was 1 April 2014, and that the transfer to Mdm Thum was registered on 27 October 2014.

80 On the available evidence, it is likely that some money from the BOC account was used towards Mdm Thum’s purchase of the Pine Close Flat – as much as about $500,000 may have been used, as Mr Ng says.81 The question then is whether that has an impact on Mr Ng’s claim for the $762,000 withdrawn by Mdm Thum on 9 March 2020.82 Mr Ng did not begrudge Mdm Thum the sum of about $500,000 being used towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat.

 but I have found against him on that (see [42], [51] and [66] above).84 Nor is it Mdm Thum’s case that the joint ownership of the sale proceeds was ever severed prior to her withdrawing $762,000 (half of the balance in the BOC account) on 9 March 2020 and leaving the other half for Mr Ng.85 From the evidence, I cannot glean any common intention of Mr Ng’s and Mdm Thum’s, other than that the balance from time to time in the UOB account, and the BOC account, was owned by them as joint tenants; that is, until Mdm Thum’s withdrawal of $762,000 from the BOC account on 9 March 2020. 86 It follows that even if I accept that $500,000 from the BOC account had been used towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat in 2014 (whether it was withdrawn by Mdm Thum herself or withdrawn by Mr Ng and given to Mdm Thum), it does not affect Mr Ng’s claim in the present suit for the $762,000 that was withdrawn by Mdm Thum on 9 March 2020. It is not contended, nor does the evidence show, that the joint tenancy in respect of the balance in the BOC account for the time being was severed by the withdrawal of about $500,000 to be used towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat.Severance of the joint tenancy over the balance sale proceeds87 There was a small balance of $5,325.15 in the UOB account prior to the sale proceeds being received on 9 January 2012,

 which I would regard as having been withdrawn and expended in 2012 (and in any case before March 2020).88 By March 2020, what remained in the UOB account, and the BOC account, would thus be the balance of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property (including interest thereon) comprising:(a) $1,532,140.94 in time deposits in the BOC account;

The issue was whether the defendant’s withdrawal of the entire balance of the joint bank account (whilst her mother was still alive) severed the joint tenancy over the balance in the bank account, such that the rule of survivorship ceased to operate in the defendant’s favour when her mother passed away. The British Columbia Supreme Court held that the defendant’s withdrawal of all of the funds in the bank account solely for her and her husband’s benefit severed the joint nature of the account as the unity of possession was destroyed (Zeligs (SC) at [185]). 91 On appeal, the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Zeligs Estate v Janes [2016] BCJ No 1355 (“Zeligs (CA)”) affirmed the lower court’s decision. The appellate court considered whether there was severance of the joint tenancy over the sale proceeds of the jointly-held property which had been deposited in the joint account (Zeligs (CA) at [73]–[74]). The court found that the defendant’s act of transferring the entirety of the sale proceeds contained in the joint bank account to herself and her husband resulted in the severance of the joint tenancy over those sale proceeds as the unity of title was destroyed, which in turn extinguished the defendant’s right of survivorship (Zeligs (CA) at [77]–[78]). Consequently, the defendant held a half-share of what she had taken, on trust for her mother’s estate (Zeligs (CA) at [79]).92 Zeligs (SC) and Zeligs (CA) demonstrate that where the entire balance of a joint account is drawn down to zero, any joint tenancy over sale proceeds formerly in the account is necessarily severed for the four unities are no longer present. As stated by the Court of Appeal in Goh Teh Lee v Lim Li Pheng Maria and others [2010] 3 SLR 364 at [17]: the unities of interest, title, time and possession are pre-requisites for a joint tenancy to exist. 93 In the present case, Mdm Thum and Mr Ng each took around half of the balance of the sale proceeds in March 2020, and the bank accounts were closed.  Mdm Thum deposited the $762,000 which she withdrew into a bank account in her sole name, and Mr Ng deposited the $766,466.62 which he withdrew into a bank account in his sole name. Thereafter, there ceased to be any chose in action that was held jointly by both parties, and the unities of interest, title, time, and possession no longer existed. I thus find that the withdrawal of the entire balance of both the BOC and UOB accounts (which comprised the balance sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property) – with the accounts then being closed – severed the joint tenancy over the balance sale proceeds in March 2020.94 When Mdm Thum withdrew the $762,000 from the BOC account on 9 March 2020, she intended thereby to end the joint ownership of the balance sale proceeds in that account. She did not intend to share with Mr Ng the $762,000 she had taken, but neither did she intend to lay claim to the balance in the BOC account – she left it for Mr Ng to take,

 as he did on 31 March 2020. Similarly, when Mr Ng withdrew what remained in the BOC and the UOB accounts on 31 March 2020, he did not intend to share with Mdm Thum what he had taken – he intended to keep that for himself.95 In Zeligs (SC) and Zeligs (CA), one of two joint tenants emptied the joint bank account, leading to the end of the joint tenancy over the sale proceeds in the account. Here, each of the two joint tenants took around half of the balance of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property in March 2020, with the same end-result: nothing remained in their joint names, and the joint tenancy came to an end. Such conduct – where one or more joint tenants operate on their own interests in the property – is a recognised mode of severing a joint tenancy in equity: Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching [2018] 2 SLR 84 at [18]–[19].96 Absent any other intention of the parties, severance of a joint tenancy results in a tenancy in common in equal parts between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum (see Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind v Lee Sai Khim and others [2011] SGHC 64 at [25] and Damodaran at [92]–[94]). Accordingly, Mdm Thum was entitled to take a half-share of the money in the BOC account, as she did. If the balance in the UOB account were included as well, Mdm Thum took slightly less than half of the balance sale proceeds as at March 2020: she took $762,000 whilst Mr Ng took $766,466.62 ($761,048.42 from the BOC account, and $5,418.20 from the UOB account). Either way, Mdm Thum was entitled to the $762,000 that she withdrew from the BOC account on 9 March 2020.97 I have already rejected both grounds on which Mr Ng claimed the $762,000 from Mdm Thum: see [10], [44] and [66] above. What remained was a joint tenancy over the balance sale proceeds which was severed in March 2020. Mdm Thum was entitled to take half of the balance, and what she took on 9 March 2020 is slightly less than half. It follows that Mr Ng’s claim for the sum of $762,000 (or “such sums to be paid by Mdm Thum as determined by the court”

) fails.98 I could not turn back the clock to when the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property amounting to some $3.7m were first received in January 2012, and limit Mdm Thum to only receiving half of that amount thereafter. It would have been unprincipled to attempt some retrospective division of the sale proceeds equally between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum – that would have gone against their common intention that the balance sale proceeds from time to time were jointly owned (as I have found at [42], [51] and [66] above).99 In any case, the evidence before me did not allow for retrospective division of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property equally between Mr Ng and Mdm Thum. I accept Mdm Thum’s evidence that some part of the $1m that she received in January 2012 went towards paying off loans that she had procured for Seacon’s benefit, and some part went towards reimbursing her for her direct financial contributions to Seacon.

 If I were to divide the sale proceeds of some $3.7m equally between the parties, I would first have to subtract the amounts which Mdm Thum had used to pay off the loans and to reimburse herself for her financial contributions – it would not be fair for Mdm Thum to have to use her share of the sale proceeds to repay the loans or reimburse herself. However, there was no evidence of exactly how much of the $1m Mdm Thum received was used for those purposes. Furthermore, as I noted above at [67]–[80], it is likely that some money from the BOC account was used by Mdm Thum towards the purchase of the Pine Close Flat, but on the evidence I cannot say precisely how much. Moreover, although the Pine Close Flat was in Mdm Thum’s sole name, both she and Mr Ng stayed there, and the evidence does not support a finding that what was used towards purchasing the Pine Close Flat was meant to be counted towards Mdm Thum’s share of the sale proceeds of the Sennett Lane Property. Conclusion100 For the above reasons, I dismiss Mr Ng’s claim.101 In principle, Mdm Thum is entitled to costs from Mr Ng. Unless the parties agree on costs, they are to file and serve their respective cost submissions, limited to 8 pages (excluding any schedule of disbursements), within 14 days. Costs will be assessed thereafter, by me or by a registrar.Andre ManiamJudge of the High CourtKanagavijayan Nadarajan (Kana & Co) for the plaintiff;Oei Ai Hoea Anna (Tan Oei & Oei LLC) (instructed) and Sng Kheng Huat (Sng & Co) for the defendant.
