These were Blumont,

 (collectively, “BAL”). The accused persons succeeded. 2 Not only was their scheme elaborate and thoroughly planned, but it was also complex, sophisticated, highly exploitative, long running, and well-guised. Before me, the accused persons also displayed no remorse for their conduct, or regret for the damaging consequences which followed therefrom. Instead, they denied every charge brought against them and pushed the blame to others. They also cast aspersions on the integrity of the Prosecution and investigating agencies. 3 For these, amongst other reasons I will discuss in these grounds, it is – on hindsight – perhaps somewhat unsurprising that the Prosecution had described this matter as the “most serious case of stock market manipulation in Singapore”,

 an assertion which I will need to return at the very end of these grounds.4 For his involvement in the entire scheme – from its conception, its execution, to the period following its eventual discovery – the First Accused, Mr Soh Chee Wen (also known as “John Soh”), faced a total of 189 charges. These fell within five distinct groups:

  Schedule of Charges (4 Sep 2019) (“Schedule of Charges”) at pp 1–103.



 (a) First, ten charges for being a party to conspiracies to commit offences under s 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “SFA”), which proscribed “false trading and market rigging transactions”. The Second Accused, Ms Quah Su-Ling, was alleged to be his co-conspirator. It should also be noted that six of these ten charges concerned the markets for BAL shares (the “False Trading Charges”). The remaining four concerned the prices of BAL shares (the “Price Manipulation Charges”). (b) Second, 162 charges for a party to conspiracies to commit offences under s 201(b) of the SFA, which prohibited the use of manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the subscription, purchase, or sale of securities. The Second Accused was, again, alleged to be his co-conspirator. After the close of the Prosecution’s case, only 161 of these charges remained in issue before me as I had acquitted the accused persons of a single charge

 pursuant to the submissions that there had been no case to answer by the accused persons (see [1518]–[1519] below). Thus, in these grounds, I will refer only to the 161 charges as the “Deception Charges”. (c) Third, six charges for being a party to conspiracies to commit offences under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (the “Penal Code”), that was, cheating and dishonestly inducing property to be delivered (the “Cheating Charges”). In essence, these charges alleged that the accused persons had conspired to dishonestly induce two entities to deliver hundreds of millions in margin financing. (d) Fourth, three charges for being concerned in the management of Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold while being an undischarged bankrupt, contrary to s 148(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Companies Act”). I refer to these charges as the “Company Management Charges”. The First Accused had been adjudged bankrupt in Malaysia on 14 January 2002 and has remained undischarged ever since.

  First Agreed Statement of Facts (8 Feb 2019) (“1ASOF”) at para 23.



(e) Lastly, five charges for perverting the course of justice contrary to s 204A of the Penal Code and a further three charges for attempting to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 204A read with s 511 of the Penal Code (collectively, the “Witness Tampering Charges”). These eight charges essentially alleged that the First Accused had successfully tampered or attempted to tamper with the evidence of four key witnesses in these proceedings.5 The Second Accused faced 178 charges for offences falling within the first three groups of charges brought against the First Accused. As she was alleged to be his co-conspirator, the charges against her were essentially identical to those brought against him.

 There were 95 witnesses of fact for the Prosecution, though the attendance of 34 were dispensed with. Of these 95, 85 witnesses gave evidence by way of conditioned statements pursuant to s 264(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”). The Prosecution also called two experts – one on market surveillance, Professor Aitken;

 to respond to the evidence of Professor Aitken. Mr White took the stand for the remaining three days. The Second Accused elected not to give evidence in her defence and did not call any witnesses. At the trial, miscellaneous evidential and procedural disputes also arose, primarily during the Prosecution’s case, which necessitated intermediate resolution (for example, see my decisions in Public Prosecutor v Soh Chee Wen and another [2020] 3 SLR 1435 (“PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 1)”) and Public Prosecutor v Soh Chee Wen and another [2021] 3 SLR 641 (“PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 2)”).

 I imposed on the accused persons aggregate sentences of 36- and 20-years’ imprisonment, respectively. On both 5 May and 28 December 2022, I delivered fairly detailed reasons for my decisions, but, even so, I stated that full grounds would follow. These are the full grounds of my decision.8 Given the unprecedented scale of this matter, it should come as no surprise that these grounds of decision must address a very substantial number of issues and, as such, they are commensurately extensive. To aid the reader in navigating them, I will begin by stating the structure of these grounds, and then setting out a table of contents.Structure of these grounds of decision9 These grounds will proceed as follows:(a) First, following this section, I will provide some general background to this matter. As the events with which this case was concerned took place around a decade ago, it is useful to be reminded of the circumstances surrounding the discovery and investigation of the offences as well as the initiation of prosecution. (b) Second, I will state the crucial components of the Prosecution’s case. As would have been gleaned from [1] above, the essence of the Prosecution’s case was that the accused persons had successfully executed a conspiracy to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period.

 This general conspiracy (which I will call the “Scheme”), however, did not form the subject of any specific charge. The charges were instead concerned with narrower aspects of the Scheme; for example, with creating a false appearance with respect to the market for Blumont shares across different periods, or for dishonestly inducing Goldman Sachs

 to provide substantial margin financing. Nevertheless, the narrative put forth by the Prosecution in relation to the Scheme as a whole was the through line of all 367 charges which had been brought, and serves as a useful framework for organising the various strands of the case.(c) Third, I will explain the broad categories of evidence relied on by the Prosecution to prove the components of its case and, thus, the individual charges. Although the probative value and limitations of most of these categories of evidence should be clear once I turn to my substantive analyses of them, it is still useful to state – in a single section of these grounds – how the Prosecution set out to prove the entirety of its case.(d) Fourth, I will state the accused persons’ defence. As would have been gathered from [2] above, the accused persons’ principal response was to deny liability for all the charges brought against them. In this connection, efforts were made to undermine the credibility of the Prosecution’s case and the quality of the Prosecution’s evidence. Apart from this negative defence, however, the accused persons also put forth the positive case that several other actors who featured in this matter were the ones who had actually coordinated to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period. This section will therefore also generally explain that positive case. (e) Fifth, I will set out my decision with respect to the accused persons’ liability for the charges brought against them. After setting out those detailed grounds, which begin from [156] below, I will summarise my decision briefly from [1289] below. My decision will address the five groups of charges in the order in which they appear at [4] above.(f) Sixth, I will set out my detailed reasons for imposing on the First and Second Accused, respectively, imprisonment terms of 36 and 20 years. In this section, I will also deal with several issues which were generally disputed during the trial, but which were most relevant to the issue of sentencing.(g) Seventh, as mentioned at [2] above, aspersions were cast on the integrity of the Prosecution. More specifically, these were allegations that there had been Prosecutorial misconduct in this case. Thus, in the final section of these grounds, prior to my conclusion, I will address those allegations. Appendices to these grounds 10 There are four appendices. First, an Excel Workbook: “Index of Relevant Accounts and Charges”. Second, a table containing a glossary of the persons –both individuals and companies – referred to in these grounds. Third, a diagram which illustrates the relationships between the accused persons and certain persons relevant to this matter. Lastly, descriptions of important procedural and evidential issues which arose during the trial, and my decisions in respect of those issues.

QUERY REGARDING TRADING ACTIVITYThe share price of Blumont Group Ltd has risen from S$0.30 on 2 January 2013 to S$2.45 on 30 September 2013. This is a[n] 8 fold increase over only 9 months since the beginning of January 2013. In the same period, the market capitalization of Blumont has increased from S$508 million to S$6.3 billion. This is a 12.5 fold increase.Since December 2012, Blumont made announcements on acquisitions and investments in 9 companies, of which only small investments of under A$/US$10 million were made in 6 companies. Of the remaining investments, the highest involved a purchase consideration of up to S$48 million. There was also another investment amounting to about A$8.76 million with a concurrent subscription of convertible bonds. These announcements may not sufficiently explain the steep increase in the price of Blumont shares.On 29 July 2013, Blumont announced a rights issue at an issue price of S$0.05 for each rights share, on the basis of one rights share for every two ordinary shares in the capital of the company. The price of the rights share, which started trading on 26 September 2013, rose from S$2.10 to S$2.57, surpassing the share price which increased to S$2.45.Is the Company aware of any information not previously announced concerning not only you (the issuer), your subsidiaries or associated companies but any other information which, if known, might explain the steep increase in the share price? Is the Company aware of any other possible explanation for the trading?Can you confirm your compliance with the listing rules and, in particular, listing rule 703?15 Similarly, on 2 October 2013, Today published an article titled, “SIAS and SGX query ‘steep increase’ in Blumont share price”.

On Friday, 4 October 2013, Blumont’s share price fell sharply from S$1.895 to S$0.88 within the first hour of the trading day. The share prices of Asiasons and LionGold followed suit, falling from S$2.65 to S$1.04 and S$1.42 to S$0.875, respectively. As a response, the SGX suspended the trading of all three counters that same day at around 10.00am.

 When trading resumed on 7 October 2013, BAL’s share prices continued to fall rapidly, dropping from S$0.88, S$1.04, and S$0.875 before the suspension, to S$0.13, S$0.15, and S$0.25 by the end of that trading day.

 Collectively, I will refer to the sharp price drops on both 4 and 7 October 2013 as “the Crash”.19 Whether the foregoing articles, queries, and decisions had materially contributed to the crash that followed the crescendo which had been building since August 2012 was a matter of considerable dispute. The Prosecution’s case was, naturally, that the accused persons were responsible for the Crash because they had, by their Scheme, created appearances as to the markets and prices of BAL shares which were “so utterly false that, when the music eventually stopped and the bubble burst on 4 October 2013, the share prices of all three companies collapsed”.

 and her team’s investigations were extensive.21 Following investigations, in the third quarter of 2016, the Prosecution preferred charges against the First and Second Accused. However, it should be noted that at the start of the trial, the accused persons were charged with abetting, by conspiracy, offences under s 197(1)(b) and s 201(b) of the SFA as well as s 420 of the Penal Code. They had not been charged for criminal conspiracy under s 120B of the Penal Code. It was only in July 2019, after the trial had commenced, that the Prosecution applied to amend the original charges for abetment to the Conspiracy Charges, an application which I allowed (see [1502]–[1506] below). The consequences of this amendment remained contentious in closing (see [126] below) and even at the sentencing stage of these proceedings (see [1319] below).22 A third person, Mr Goh HC,

 whom the Prosecution assessed had played a smaller role in the Scheme – was also charged alongside the accused persons. Mr Goh HC faced a total of six charges for abetting, by intentionally aiding, the accused persons in their commission of offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. These six offences were punishable under s 204(1) of the SFA read with s 109 of the Penal Code.

You are charged at the instance of the Public Prosecutor and the charges against you are: That you, Goh in Calm, …Between 18 March and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, did abet by intentionally aiding one Soh Chee Wen (“Soh”) and one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to engage in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the market for the securities of Blumont Group Ltd (“Blumont”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Trading Ltd, to wit, by:(a)  assisting Soh and Quah to monitor the shareholding and manage the finance of trading accounts in their control; and (b) allowing Soh or Quah to control trading accounts in your name and in the name of your wife Huang Phuet Mui, and that in consequence of your abetment, trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence between 18 March and 3 October 2013) were controlled for trading and holding Blumont securities by Soh and/or Quah, and trading activities in Blumont securities were conducted for the purpose of creating the said false appearance with respect to the market for the securities of Blumont, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”) punishable under section 204(1) of the SFA read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).24 See J sentenced Mr Goh HC to 36 months’ imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges, which were ordered to run concurrently (see Public Prosecutor v Goh Hin Calm HC/CC 13/2019).

 Thereafter, the trial against the accused persons commenced before me. The Prosecution’s case25 Broadly, it was the Prosecution’s case that during the Relevant Period, the accused persons had masterminded a scheme to artificially inflate the markets for and manipulate prices of BAL shares. They were said, essentially, to have carried out this scheme by controlling, coordinating their use of, obtaining financing for, and conducting illegitimate trading activity in an extensive web comprising 189 trading accounts (the “Relevant Accounts”) held with 20 financial institutions (“FIs”) in the names of 60 individuals and companies (the “Relevant Accountholders”). The 20 FIs comprised nine local brokerages, as well as 11 foreign brokerages and private banks. 26 In the next seven sub-sections, I will set out the aspects of this general case in greater detail as follows. (a) First, how the accused persons were said to have obtained control of and used the Relevant Accounts. The broad relationships between the accused persons and the Relevant Accountholders will be described. (b) Second, how the accused persons were said to have coordinated their use of the Relevant Accounts to perpetuate their Scheme, and how the accused persons allegedly kept atop the coordination of the substantial number of accounts they controlled.(c) Third, how the accused persons purportedly financed the Relevant Accounts. This principally included obtaining margin financing from the FIs. (d) Fourth, the two key techniques used by accused persons to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares. The predominant practice that was said to have been used was “wash trading”. Connectedly, and although not illegitimate per se, the accused persons were also said to have abused contra trading.(e) Fifth, by way of illustration, a trading technique allegedly used by accused persons to inflate the prices of BAL shares will be described. This was known as “aggressive trading”. In this connection, I will also set out an incident relied on by the Prosecution to establish one of the four Price Manipulation Charges.(f) Sixth, the alleged broader purpose of the accused persons’ Scheme, and how they intended it to be utilised beyond the mere fact of price hikes and drops. On this matter, it is necessary to outline the evidence of two key witnesses, Mr Tai

 (g) Lastly, how the accused persons conducted themselves after the Crash. Such conduct included, for example, the First Accused’s involvement in meetings that appeared to serve the purpose of assisting various Relevant Accountholders settle losses suffered as a result of the Crash. 27 These seven components formed the building blocks on which the Prosecution’s overarching thesis – as stated at [25] above – was constructed. They served to support the general inference that there were, in fact, conspiracies between the accused persons to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares, and, further, that such conspiracies had been successfully carried out.The accused persons controlled the 189 Relevant Accounts28 In this sub-section, I set out some details about the Relevant Accounts, state how the accused persons were said by the Prosecution to have obtained control of them and, further, how the accused persons actually used them. 29 The 189 Relevant Accounts were held in the names of the Second Accused, Mr Goh HC, as well as 36 other individuals and 22 corporations.

This group was the most significant. Excluding entities under their control, it comprised 14 individuals under whose names 81 Relevant Accounts were held with 13 FIs.

32 Even so, as stated at [28] above, most of the Relevant Accountholders had a personal connection with either or both accused persons. The existence of such links formed an important part of the Prosecution’s case. The accused persons were said to have drawn on their personal and business relationships in order to obtain control of the existing Relevant Accounts, and, further, even to cause new trading accounts to be created for their use.

 Mr Chen was an example. In respect of all 14 Relevant Accounts held in his name, he testified that, from 2000 to 2013, the First Accused had approached him on several occasions to open trading accounts with various FIs. Mr Chen stated that this was on the understanding that those trading accounts were to be controlled and used by the First Accused.

33 That said, although the accused persons supposedly “drew on” their relationships with the Relevant Accountholders, these accountholders were not the characters that were most germane to the issue of control. Indeed, the fact that Mr Chen gave evidence as an accountholder was the exception. Of the 60 Relevant Accountholders, only six individuals were called by the Prosecution to give evidence at the trial, although some of them were able to speak for corporate accountholders.34 Instead, the persons more pertinent to the Prosecution’s case were those who had performed functions which directly or indirectly allowed the accused persons to regularly place trades in the Relevant Accounts in furtherance of the Scheme, who had kept them apprised of the information they needed to know to stay atop the Scheme, and who had even managed certain Relevant Accounts on their behalf.35 Broadly, the functions performed by these persons could be divided into two categories:(a) First, functions which were operational in character. This would include tasks such as keying orders into the Relevant Accounts pursuant to trading instructions given by the accused persons; relaying instructions to persons who would then key in the orders; reporting the status of orders placed; and providing updates of the trades in cash accounts due to be settled.(b) Second, functions which involved a degree of autonomy, decision-making and administration. This included deciding for themselves whether to place orders for Blumont, Asiasons or LionGold shares, and if so, the timing, volume, and price of that order. Further, if placing the order using a cash account, whether to pick up the shares or to trade on a contra basis.36 Four types of persons allegedly carried out these functions.

 First, the dealers or remisiers employed by and/or acting as commissioned agents for the local FIs. I will refer to them as trading representatives or “TRs”. Second, the persons or entities formally authorised to give trading instructions on behalf of the Relevant Accountholders. Specifically, these were persons with limited powers of attorney (“LPOA”) to instruct or place trades on behalf of the Relevant Accountholders in their accounts. I will refer to these persons as the “intermediaries”. Third, some of the Relevant Accountholders themselves, in connection with certain accounts. Lastly, third parties who were not TRs, intermediaries, or Relevant Accountholders.37 The most significant of these four groups were the TRs and intermediaries. A total of 23 TRs managed the 131 Relevant Accounts held with local FIs (the “Local Accounts”).

41 I give another example. This example illustrates the Prosecution’s case not only in respect of what functions specific TRs had performed, but also how those TRs came to perform those functions in the first place. This “how” question complemented the Prosecution’s claim that the accused persons “drew on” their personal relationship to obtain control of the Relevant Accounts. Mr Chen held one Relevant Account

 42 It was Mr Ong KC’s evidence that, by August 2012 the First Accused had frequently been giving trading instructions in respect of Mr Chen’s account with Maybank Kim Eng. This arrangement was initially limited. On Mr Ong KC’s evidence, Mr Chen would occasionally permit the First Accused to give trading instructions on his behalf, whenever he was busy. On such occasions, Mr Chen would inform him ahead of time that the First Accused would be calling Mr Ong KC to give trading instructions. Subsequently, however, instructions from the First Accused were not prefaced by such calls from Mr Chen to Mr Ong KC. Nevertheless, the latter continued to accept those instructions because he “trusted” that Mr Chen “would not act as a proxy for other persons [given that] he was a lawyer in Malaysia”.

44 However, not all TRs accepted the accused persons’ trading instructions because they trusted their legitimacy on the basis of some prior relationship. There were varying reasons they each did so, including a fear of losing the commissions they earned from the accused persons’ very active trading. Mr Jack Ng (see [40] above) was an example. His evidence was that after he had been verbally authorised by the Relevant Accountholders to accept instructions from the Second Accused, he had mailed third-party authorisation forms to each of them so as to allow them to properly authorise the Second Accused to give instructions on their behalf. The Second Accused, he testified, took issue with this and threatened to move her business to another FI. Not wanting to lose her or the other accountholders as clients, Mr Jack Ng dropped the issue and continued accepting her instructions without her being formally authorised.

 Under his management were 29 Relevant Accounts of 19 accountholders. He gave evidence that, despite believing that the accused persons’ trades had likely been improper, he nevertheless carried them out because he was “greedy for the commissions”. He likely made around S$1 million in commissions between January 2012 and October 2013 “just by trading for [the accused persons]” alone.

45 These examples highlight a salient point about the Prosecution’s case. For the accused persons to have obtained direct control of the Relevant Accounts, they required both the Relevant Accountholder, and the TR or intermediary managing the account, to be amenable. Even if a particular accountholder was agreeable to their account being used, it still would not have been possible for the accused persons to exercise direct control if the TR or intermediary had refused to act on their instructions. Although the use of internet trading accounts qualified this, most of the Relevant Accountholders as well as the accused persons did not have a penchant for using internet trading platforms. This was the reason the TRs and intermediaries – as stated at [37] above – played a significant role in this matter.46 An example of a TR who was probably not amenable to receiving instructions from persons who were not formally authorised was Mr See

 As regards the other four Relevant Accounts, the Second Accused was the one who gave Mr See instructions. She was, of course, authorised in respect of her own accounts and she was also an authorised signatory for Friendship Bridge’s account.

 Accordingly, there was no reason for Mr See not to accept her instructions.48 From this, it can be seen that even if the accused persons had not been able – or had not attempted to – persuade a particular TR or intermediary to permit their direct use of the Relevant Accounts, they could still exercise indirect control by relaying instructions through the Relevant Accountholder or authorised signatories. On the other hand, if the TR or intermediary was amenable to acting on the accused persons’ instructions despite want of formal authority – eg, Mr Ong KC, Mr Jack Ng, and Mr Wong XY discussed above – the accused persons then allegedly had a range of means by which they could exercise control. They could, as suggested at [35] above, give direct instructions, relay instructions through various individuals, or even delegate the task of giving instructions to others.49 Given the number of Relevant Accounts, accountholders, TRs, and intermediaries, it should not be surprising that there were a fair number of permutations as regards how the accused persons were said to have obtained control of the Relevant Accounts, and exercised control – whether it was through the giving of direct instructions to TRs or intermediaries, relaying instructions through others, or delegating their decision-making functions. 50 I return to these variations and nuances on the issue of control at [194] below when I turn to explain my findings in respect of whether the accused persons had in fact controlled each account. Having set out this broad explanation, I turn next to describe how the accused persons allegedly coordinated such control in pursuance of the Scheme.The accused persons used the Relevant Accounts in concert 51 On the footing that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons, the Prosecution suggested that such control had been exercised in concert to give effect to their Scheme. This took many forms, and, in this sub-section, I set out some examples from various strands of the Prosecution’s case.52 The most straightforward manner in which the accused persons were said to have acted in concert, was by coordinating the BAL trading activity of the Relevant Accounts so as to carry out wash trading between them (“wash trading” is explained at [78] below). Various modes of proof were relied on by the Prosecution to establish the blatant coordination. The first and most direct means of proof was the evidence of key witnesses. Mr Leroy Lau, for example, testified that he took trading instructions from the accused persons to coordinate ‘roll-over’ trades with them so as to enable them to “refresh” the positions in the other Relevant Accounts. His description of such coordination is usefully considered in full:

How I took trading instructions from [the accused persons]I took trading instructions from [the First Accused (“John”)] and [the Second Accused (“Su-Ling”)] via phone calls and messages. As I knew that what we were doing was illegal, I purchased a few pre-paid SIM cards specifically to communicate with John and Su-Ling so as to avoid detection by the authorities as I could simply dispose of the pre-paid SIM cards. John also told me that he and Su-Ling used Malaysian phone numbers which were not in their own name so that they would be able to deny responsibility for communications if ever questioned by the authorities. During the time when I was helping John and Su-Ling, I used several different pre-paid SIM cards (some of which were used concurrently) to communicate with John and Su-Ling. I have since disposed most of these SIM cards.I coordinated rollover trades with Su-Ling, and John, usually via phone calls. We largely refrained from messaging each other because it would leave a retrievable record of what we discussed.…The trading instructions I took from [the accused persons]Generating artificial liquidityOverview of rollover tradesAs a day trader who preferred to complete all rollover trades by the end of the trading day, there were occasions when Su-Ling was unable to buy up shares from me – on some of these occasions, John would call me personally, very late in the trading day, to buy up these shares which Su-Ling did not buy up from me. An example of this can be seen from a message which I sent to John on 27 September 2013 at 3.21 pm to tell him that I had 4 million LionGold shares which I needed him to buy from me:

As such, Su-Ling communicated with me, numerous times a day, in order to coordinate the rollover trades. ……Even though I was coordinating most of the rollover trades in LionGold with Su-Ling, John was fully aware that I was helping Su-Ling carry out rollover trades. This is clear from messages between me and John on 23 July 2013 between 10.41am and 10.42am:

John replied to tell me that I must inform Su-Ling that I was trading in order to roll LionGold shares with her. He knew that if I did not do so, Su-Ling would “panic” because she would think that there were other buyers and sellers in the market who were not part of their group – this was a constant cause for concern for John and Su-Ling because they wanted to control the trading activity of BAL. At the time of these messages, I was carrying out rollover trades with Su-Ling.53 The Prosecution also carried out their own verification work to demonstrate that the communications records between Mr Leroy Lau and the accused persons cohered with the account given by Mr Leroy Lau.

54 Read with Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence as to the purpose of his communications with the Second Accused, this table suggested that the accused persons had in fact been coordinating their Scheme.55 Apart from unabashedly coordinating trading activity in an illegitimate manner, there were also less direct means by which the Prosecution suggested that the accused persons had acted in concert, or, at least, had enabled themselves to do so more effectively. These included certain practices they had allegedly adopted and documents that they had supposedly maintained. 56 One such practice was trade reporting. This was a practice that was most pertinent to the Relevant Accounts held with local FIs, in respect of which the accused persons were said to have given direct instructions to the TRs. For example, this included the accounts managed by Mr Jack Ng mentioned at [40] above.57 The giving of such direct instructions typically followed this sequence. First, the accused persons would contact the TR over the phone or via text message to give them trading instructions. Some TRs, on certain occasions, were the ones to initiate contact. Second, the TR would then place an order in the Relevant Account according to those instructions. Third, if the order was fulfilled immediately, the TRs would report that accordingly. If it was not, they would first report that the order was in the queue, and thereafter, that the order was fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or not fulfilled. Last, the TRs would also, after T+5 days, report to the accused persons that those shares were due to be sold or picked up. The accused persons would then give their fresh instructions, and the cycle would repeat. By this system of reporting, the accused persons were kept apprised of the due positions in the Relevant Accounts and, thus, able to take timely trading decisions in furtherance of their Scheme.58 Mr Jack Ng may, again, be used as an example. The messages set out below were extracted from Mr Jack Ng’s mobile device and the recipients of these messages were the phone numbers +60 12304 0678 (the “678 number”) and 9650 6523. The former number, on the Prosecution’s case, was one used by the First Accused, though there was some dispute about this.

The verification work performed by the investigation officers showed that Mr Jack Ng had, in these messages, aggregated the total shares purchased in the eight Relevant Accounts under his management. In fact, he had also averaged the purchase price of multiple orders without either specifying the account in which the trades had been executed, or the specific prices at which the individual purchases had been made.

 This, on the Prosecution’s case, stood in support of the conclusion that the accused persons were coordinating their control of the Relevant Accounts because, if they had not been, one would expect lines between the individual accounts – particularly for those accounts held by different accountholders – to matter.60 I turn to the documents mentioned at [55] above. These included spreadsheets extracted from the accused persons’ electronic devices which recorded the shareholdings of various securities trading accounts, including several Relevant Accounts. I will refer to this generally, as the “Shareholding Schedule”, though I should note that there were various iterations of these spreadsheets uncovered during the investigations.

 These spreadsheets were not a perfect reflection of the complete list of Relevant Accounts and Relevant Accountholders. There were entries for trading accounts which did not form the subject matter of, nor were they relevant to, any of the charges. Conversely, there were Relevant Accounts which did not feature in them. Nevertheless, the Prosecution’s case was that, when viewed alongside the totality of the other strands of evidence, the Shareholding Schedule supported the inference that the accused persons had been coordinating their use of the Relevant Accounts.61 The Shareholding Schedule captured the following information. The headings of the first three columns were: (a) “Name”; (b) “Broker”; and (c) “Statement Date”. In the rows under “Name”, there are entries such as “QSL” (ie, the Second Accused) and “GHC” (ie, Mr Goh HC). The rows under “Broker” recorded particular FIs with which the shares had been held. Some entries under this column also specified whether the shares held with a particular FI were “collateral”, “lock[ed] up”, or “trading”. The rows under “Statement Date” simply indicated the dates of the trading account statements from which the information was derived. The headings of the subsequent columns contained the names of the particular shares which the accused persons were allegedly tracking. This included Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold. The rows under each of these columns recorded a volume. For example, assuming the spreadsheet was correct, as at 19 March 2013, there were 18,422,000 Blumont shares in the Second Accused’s account with Julius Baer.

 The heading of the final column was liabilities. Although it was unclear the exact liabilities to which this was referring, the Prosecution suggested it could be inferred. Using the Second Accused’s Julius Baer account as a continuing example, the Shareholding Schedule indicated that as at 19 March 2013, the account had S$30,400,000 in liabilities.

62 The inclusion of these details in the spreadsheets – especially in light of the number of accountholders and accounts which featured – begged the question of why the accused persons were even interested in this information. This, on the Prosecution’s case, was most sensibly answered by the inference that the accused persons had been monitoring the BAL shareholdings they held through the various Relevant Accounts they had controlled. Such monitoring was essential for the accused persons to stay atop their highly complex scheme with so many moving parts and persons. 63 On the Prosecution’s full case, the accused persons’ coordinated use of the Relevant Accounts could be inferred from many more facts and pieces of evidence than set out above. I will return to them in greater detail when I turn to set out my findings on this issue at [728] below. For now, the three facets of coordination set out above adequately illustrate the manner in which the Prosecution set out to prove this aspect of its case.The accused persons obtained financing for the Relevant Accounts64 I turn next to how the accused persons had allegedly financed the trading activity conducted in the Relevant Accounts. Such financing also allowed the Scheme to be scaled-up. Chiefly, the method the accused persons were said to have used was margin financing. Of the 131 Local Accounts, 40 were margin accounts.

65 The quantum of financing provided to the accounts held with the foreign FIs, in particular, was extensive. Six such accounts formed the subject of the Cheating Charges – two held with Goldman Sachs and four with IB. Through these six accounts, cheated Goldman Sachs and IB were said to have been cheated of more than S$820 million (see [68] below).66 To explain briefly, margin accounts are used to purchase shares using credit facilities granted on the value of shares provided to the FI as collateral. The acceptability of the shares proposed as collateral varied amongst FIs. For example, the representative who gave evidence on behalf of Maybank Kim Eng,

 testified that prior to 2013, the Head of the FI’s Margin Department had the sole discretion to determine the shares which were marginable, taking into account considerations such as the market capitalisation of the shares, its liquidity, and volatility. Thereafter, the decision-making powers in respect of this function was conferred on a committee within Maybank Kim Eng.

67 Further, not all marginable shares commanded the same loan-to-value ratio. Even in respect of the same share, this ratio also varied amongst FIs. That said, the actual ratios commanded by the shares pledged in the financed accounts were not essential to the case. What was more pertinent was whether the FIs had in fact financed those accounts. To prove this, the Prosecution relied on the FIs’ representatives’ evidence. I take, for example, the margin accounts held with AmFraser. Its representative, one Mr Tan SK,

69 On the Prosecution’s case, the crucial issue which arose from the fact of such financing was whether the accused persons had been involved in the provision of collateral and, thus, the procuring of margin financing from these FIs. In their opening statement, it was said that the accused persons wanted to increase the attractiveness of BAL shares so that they could be pledged as collateral to obtain financing. This financing then allowed them to engage in further manipulative activities, which would, in turn, further increase the attractiveness of those shares as collateral, allowing them to obtain even more financing, and so on. This was characterised by the Prosecution as a “vicious cycle of deception, cheating, and market manipulation”.

 If, indeed, the accused persons had been involved in the procurement of such financing, the greater the extent of their involvement, the stronger the base of facts from which an inference can be drawn as regards the existence of the Scheme alleged.70 Despite the fact that such financing was crucial to the operation of the Scheme on the Prosecution’s general case, it should be noted that they did not endeavour to address this issue comprehensively. By this, I mean that the Prosecution did not set out to prove that the accused persons had been involved in the obtaining of financing for each and every Relevant Account. In so far as the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges were concerned, the extent of the accused persons’ involvement in the context of financing was but one part of the Prosecution’s case from which they invited the court to infer the accused persons’ Scheme. 71 In respect of the Cheating Charges, however, it was axiomatic that the Prosecution needed to prove its specific case that the accused persons had conspired to obtain financing from Goldman Sachs and IB in violation of s 420 of the Penal Code. In this regard, it was the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had conspired to induce the provision of such financing by dishonestly concealing from Goldman Sachs and IB, the fact that they had been “engaging in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance in the market” for BAL shares.72 On this issue of inducement, however, it is pertinent to reiterate that the marginability and the loan-to-value ratio of a share were matters determined by the FI (see [66] above). Clients and third parties did not have input on these decisions, and, in that sense, they are unable (barring an allegation of there being some influence over the relevant decision-makers) to positively induce an FI to provide financing. The Prosecution therefore took the position that, rather than positively misrepresenting to Goldman Sachs and IB that BAL shares were not the subject of false trading or price manipulation, the accused persons had misrepresented this state of affairs by omission.

 73 I will return to this issue at [1117] below. For now, it suffices to state that the Prosecution’s factual case in respect of the six Cheating Charges turned on the fundamental question of whether the accused persons had controlled the six Relevant Accounts. The Prosecution said that in the context of their case, “the entire deception required that [the First Accused] conceal his involvement from the FIs completely, and that [the Second Accused] conceal her involvement in the accounts for which she was not an accountholder”. Thus, the accused persons would not have made personal representations to Goldman Sachs and IB that would have revealed their involvement.

 On the footing that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons, it was the Prosecution’s case that they had been actively involved in orchestrating and facilitating the deception of Goldman Sachs and IB. This evidenced their conspiracies to induce these FIs to deliver financing,

 which they were ultimately successful in doing.The accused persons inflated the liquidity of BAL shares74 Earlier in the Relevant Period, BAL shares were not widely marginable. Thus, to keep their capital needs to a minimum, it was the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons initially engaged in active contra trading using the cash accounts held with local FIs.

75 When shares are purchased using a cash account, the accountholder is given a few days from the date of the trade (“T”) for settlement. During the Relevant Period, the SGX (and thus, the FIs) allowed settlement to be effected no later than five days after the day of the trade, ie, T+5. Settlement may be effected either by paying for or selling the shares. If the accountholder chooses to sell the shares by the end of the settlement period, this is known as a “contra trade”. Depending on whether the shares are sold at a price higher or lower than that at which they were bought, and after the deduction of commissions and transaction costs, the accountholder would either obtain or incur the difference as a contra profit or loss. Contra trading allegedly allowed the accused persons – in executing the Scheme – to trade in large volumes of BAL shares without needing to undertake the capital expense which would otherwise be necessary to purchase the shares. They needed only to incur commissions, transaction fees and contra losses (if any).76 On the Prosecution’s case, by carrying out consistent “roll-over” contra trades, the accused persons were able to abuse the contra trading mechanism to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares. Such artificial liquidity, in turn, had the effect of making BAL shares more attractive to genuine market participants. The involvement of real market participants would also help keep the shares on an upward trend which would also allow the accused persons to avoid contra losses that would have otherwise crippled a long-term market manipulation scheme premised heavily on contra trading. By way of an illustration, Mr Jack Ng gave evidence that the Second Accused was a “contra player”, and that she generally “rolled over her trades”:

[Mr Kuan AM] introduced [the Second Accused] to me. I remember [Mr Kuan AM] telling me one day that he would introduce the CEO of [IPCO] to me as a client. The next day after this conversation, [the Second Accused] visited me at [OCBC Securities’] office. She opened a cash account … with me. When she opened her account, [the Second Accused] told me that she is a “contra player” – one who trades on a contra basis. …Soon after, [the Second Accused] introduced [Ms Lim SH], [Ms Ng SL], and [Mr Goh HC] (“the nominees”) to me on different occasions. Before the nominees visited me at [OCBC Securities’] office, [the Second Accused] would call and tell me that her friend would be coming to [OCBC Securities’] office to open an account. She also told me that the nominees were her good friends and were also “contra players”. …Initially, [the Second Accused] was not a very active trader, though all her trades were contra trades. Subsequently, [the Second Accused] became a more active contra trader. I cannot remember when that was. However, by August 2012, she would call me almost every day to place orders. Around that time, [the Second Accused] started “rolling over” her trades. That is, when the settlement date comes, [the Second Accused] would sell her shares and buy back a similar number of shares on the same day. This trading pattern continued up till the [Crash].77 Contra trading was not, by itself, an illegitimate trading technique. That said, the accused persons were said to have abused it whilst also deploying other illegitimate trading techniques to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares.

 This included, predominantly, “wash trading”. 78 A wash trade occurs when the two parties to the trade, the buyer and seller, are not acting as independent commercial parties but, rather, in concert by trading with each other. In such trades, apart from the commissions and transaction costs paid to the brokerage, no money genuinely exchanges hands. They thus do not reflect the actual demand for and supply of the security, and the trading volume generated as a result is artificial, representing false interest and activity.

 84 Several points about the foregoing sequence of calls and trades need to be highlighted. First, the three bids in Mr Menon, Mr Chen, and Mr Goh HC’s accounts were – somewhat unusually – entered at S$1.07, one tick above the best bid of S$1.065, at the best ask, thereby accounting, at least in part, for the instantaneity of these trades. Second, the 3611 number had been registered in Mr Chen’s name.

 The remaining 240,000 of Mr Leroy Lau’s ask was not ultimately fulfilled. 85 Again, on the basis that these orders in the Relevant Accounts had been entered under the control of the accused persons, these trades would have been a wash. Indeed, beyond that general proposition, it was the Prosecution’s case that the proximity of calls, orders and trades, could not have been explained by pure coincidence. It was, instead, an instance of the accused persons using the Relevant Accounts in concert as discussed at [51]–[54] above.86 I stated at [77] above that wash trading was the “predominant” practice the accused persons were said to have used to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares. There were others identified by Professor Aitken which included, for example, pre-arranged trading.

 At this point, however, there is no need to delve into how each of those practices operated. It can simply be stated that it was the Prosecution’s case that those other practices had, in fact, been used; and, alongside wash trading, those practices were said to have significantly inflated the liquidity of BAL shares. On the footing that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons and used to carry out BAL trades, the Prosecution suggested that they had been responsible for trading 1.15 billion Blumont shares for a part of the Relevant Period – 2 January to 3 October 2013. In relation to Asiasons and LionGold, the volumes attributed were 3.41 and 4.33 billion shares, respectively, for the entire Relevant Period. These volumes were said to have represented, respectively, 60%, 88%, and 90% of the total traded volume of each share during those periods.

 To be clear, these percentages do not only reflect the trading volume between the Relevant Accounts (ie, wash trades). They represent the extent of BAL trades executed in the Relevant Accounts, irrespective of whether the trades were washes.87 Not all these trades made use of an illegitimate trading practice such as wash trading. That said, the wash trades were said to have constituted a high proportion of all the BAL trading activity carried out in the Relevant Accounts. Professor Aitken’s evidence was that, in respect of Blumont, wash trading had taken place on 170 of 190 trading days, accounting for an average of around 17% of the total volume of Blumont shares traded per day.

 It was suggested by the Prosecution that these volumes of wash trading, when viewed alongside their case in respect of control and coordination, pointed clearly to the conclusion that the accused persons’ control and use of the Relevant Accounts had been applied to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares.The accused persons inflated the prices of BAL shares88 As with the practices they allegedly used to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares, the Prosecution suggested that the accused persons had also adopted a variety of practices to inflate the price of BAL shares. An illustrative example, as explained by Professor Aitken, was “aggressive trading”.

89 Professor Aitken sought to identify instances where a trader or traders caused the price of a share to move up by at least three ticks within a ten-minute period without testing the market. To elaborate, a price “tick” (also called a “step” or “pip”) is the minimum price by which a particular share could move. At that time, for shares trading at a price below S$2.00, the tick was half a cent, and for those trading above S$2.00, the tick was one cent. As regards the “without testing the market” requirement, Professor Aitken explained that, if a trader was interested in purchasing shares, he would normally “test the market’s interest by leaving a buy order at the best bid price [or lower] for a period of time”. The test trade allowed the trader to determine if there were any sellers willing to fulfil his bid at that “best bid” price or lower. Placing bids at price levels above the best bid would, of course, allow the bid to be fulfilled more quickly. However, Professor Aitken’s evidence was that, absent some information on which the trader was acting, professional traders usually “tr[ied] to avoid” moving share prices in this way as it would ultimately cost them or their clients more money.90 A relevant example took place on 30 September 2013. Professor Aitken’s analysis showed that bids entered in the Relevant Accounts between 4.47.14pm and 4.48.03pm caused the price of Asiasons shares to move from S$2.76 to S$2.81, ie, five ticks. He cited this as an instance of aggressive trading, noting that there was no price-sensitive information on the day which could otherwise explain the movement.

91 In essence, at 4.47.14pm, the best ask was S$2.76, and in the queue to sell were 315,000 in asks entered by the Relevant Accounts. This volume of 315,000 comprised around 95% of the volume of asks at S$2.76. At this moment, a bid for 500,000 shares was placed at the best ask (rather than the best bid of S$2.75) in the account of Mr Tan BK held with IB.

 These three bids were also placed in the IB account of Mr Tan BK and were all for 100,000 shares, though not all were wholly fulfilled.93 Mr Tai did not specifically give evidence in respect of these trades executed in the IB account of Mr Tan BK under his management. While it was not inconceivable that real market participants might have traded in the manner described above, that was unlikely. Even examined superficially, the trades, identified by Professor Aitken to be an instance of aggressive trading, appeared systematically targeted at driving the price of Asiasons shares upwards.

Pushing-up BAL’s prices after announcements of important corporate developments[The First Accused’s (“John”)] intention was not only to manipulate the share price prior to important announcements, but also after such announcements. John’s intention was to ensure that whenever BAL made an announcement which was likely to be publicly perceived as having a positive impact on the share price (e.g. an acquisition of a mining asset at a favourable price), he would manipulate the share price of the company upwards post-announcement in order to ensure that the shares in fact displayed the positive price impact anticipated, thereby drawing in other genuine market participants to trade. John also told me before, in relation to one of BAL’s placements, that pushing-up the share price right after the positive announcement would make the placee of the shares very happy, because the placee’s shares would have immediately made a paper profit.John would thus ask me to push-up the share price to achieve this self-fulfilling effect on the share’s price. I was predominantly involved in doing this for LionGold, and was asked to help occasionally to do so for Asiasons and Blumont. As I am a skilful trader, John did not need to tell me how to push-up the share price, and he was happy to leave it to me to decide what method I would use to push-up the price. I usually used a combination of the following steps:(a) One way I would push-up the price after a positive announcement was by deleting my sell orders which were resting on the sell-side of the order book. As there would then appear to be fewer sellers than buyers, people would be enticed to enter into the market and buy, thereby driving up the price.

  MJA-1 at paras 5.14–5.17.



(b) Another way I would push-up the price was to queue my buy orders at prices higher than the last-done price before the announcement. This is called doing a “gap-up”. When the market opened or the trading halt was lifted, my buy orders would immediately be fulfilled at the elevated price.(c) A simple way for me to move up the price on my own was by buying up all the sell orders which had been entered at increasingly higher prices, thus moving up the price of the stock.All price push-up activities would be discussed and agreed upon beforehand with John, and we would discuss the methods which I would be using to push up the price. I am certain that the trades I did immediately following any announcement by BAL were done on John’s instructions, in order to push up the share price. I personally did not mind pushing-up the price very aggressively (i.e. by more price levels, and more quickly) on such occasions, as it was very easy for me to defend my trades. It is obvious that such trades could easily be explained away as me taking a genuine interest in the stock following a positive announcement by the company.[emphasis added in bold italics; footnote added]95 The emphasised text concerns Mr Leroy Lau’s use of aggressive trading to drive the prices of BAL shares up. This lent context to similar trading activity seen at [91]–[92] above. Furthermore, on the Prosecution’s case, the context in which Mr Leroy Lau had explained why he sought to manipulate the prices of LionGold shares made sense as part of a broader scheme. Price hikes by themselves, devoid of any potential reason or explanation, tend to invite suspicion and regulatory inquiry. However, when applied in connection with corporate activity, such hikes are harder to identify as false. This segues to the next component of the Prosecution’s case.The accused persons had a broader plan for their Scheme96 As a starting point, it bears restating that the First Accused faced three charges for being concerned in the management of BAL whilst being an undischarged bankrupt (see [4(d)] above). Such involvement, the Prosecution said, enabled the First Accused to put the inflated liquidity and value of BAL shares – and, thus, the Scheme more generally – to a useful end. That was, to use those shares as “currency” for corporate deals carried out by BAL.97 To establish this allegation, the Prosecution relied on, amongst other things,

On 12 September 2013, [the First Accused (“JS”)] gave me instructions towards the end of the trading day to push down the price of Asiasons shares. Although [Mr Gan] was coordinating the Asiasons market roll at this time, these instructions came from JS himself. The best (i.e. highest) bid price in the buying queue at that time was S$1.36. I slammed the price down by entering a single large sell order [for 1.3 million shares]

 using [Mr Neo’s] IB account at S$1.30, to hit all the buy orders from S$1.33 to S$1.30. I finally entered a third sell order at S$1.30 using [Mr Neo’s] account again to prevent any new buyers from pushing the price up. All these orders had the effect of lowering the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of Asiasons shares for that day.JS later explained to me that he was trying to get Asiasons to acquire Black Elk through a share swap. The seller was a US-based hedge fund called Platinum Partners, whom JS had an existing commercial relationship with. Platinum Partners wanted to do the share swap with Asiasons shares at a lower price so that they would get more Asiasons shares. To satisfy them, JS arranged to push down the VWAP of Asiasons on 12 September to ensure that the share swap would go through. JS told me that the share price would go back up after the Black Elk deal was announced.[emphasis added; footnotes added]98 The Black Elk deal did not ultimately go through. This was because of the Crash which took place less than a month after the incident described above. However, the fact of the brokered deal had been announced. On Mr Tai’s evidence, after the efforts to bring down the price of Asiasons shares, a trading halt was called from 13 to 16 September 2013. Upon the resumption of trading on 17 September 2013, Asiasons announced the Black Elk deal. The total consideration provided by Asiasons for the deal was approximately US$171.7 million, payable in the form of 94,642,712 new, ordinary Asiasons shares to be issued.

… On 17 September, Asiasons officially announced the Black Elk deal, i.e. that it would be acquiring units in Black Elk through a share swap. On that same morning, after the trading halt was lifted, the share price of Asiasons spiked drastically from an opening price of around S$1.40 to exceed the S$2 mark in the same day. There was another sharp increase in price the day after (18 September 2013) where Asiasons share spiked from their opening price of around S$2.10 to reach the S$2.80 mark. Basically, the share price of Asiasons had doubled in two days.As I mentioned, [the First Accused (“JS”)] had put [Mr Gan (“Gabriel”)] in charge of coordinating the daily market roll for Asiasons from August 2013. I was taking trading instructions from Gabriel as per normal on 17 and 18 September during the price spike. Since most of the trades in Asiasons shares until then had been controlled by JS and [the Second Accused], I assumed that Gabriel was deliberately pushing up the price on their instructions.[emphasis added]99 Mr Tai was partially correct in his assumption. It was not Mr Gan who had been “deliberately pushing up” prices but, rather Mr Leroy Lau. The evidence given by Mr Leroy Lau corroborated the observations made by Mr Tai with respect to the price hike. Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence was as follows:

Another instance when I helped [the First Accused (“John”)] push-up price was in Asiasons shares, on 18 September 2013. This was after a key announcement by Asiasons before trading opened on 17 September 2013, that Asiasons was breaking into the oil and gas sector by acquiring a 27.5% stake in Black Elk. …That was a very interesting example where John (through [Mr Gwee (“Dick”)]) specifically asked me to come in and push-up Asiasons’ share price for him. Unlike LionGold, I was not heavily involved in trading Asiasons prior to the Black Elk Announcement. As such, John needed to find a way to incentivise me to help him push-up Asiasons, a counter I was neither interested nor invested in, especially since he did not involve me in the big profits arising from the upward movement in Asiasons’ share price right after the Black Elk Announcement.To enable me to get involved in pushing-up Asiasons’ share price for him, John (through Dick) agreed to sell me a large block of Asiasons shares at a cash discount, and asked Dick to help arrange for me to acquire these shares. What is meant by “cash discount” is that I would buy the shares in the market at market price, and John would refund me the discount by paying me the difference in cash – I recall Dick specifically saying over the telephone “Towkay heng lui” (Hokkien for “Boss pay money”). The day after the Black Elk Announcement, I recall buying about 1 million Asiasons shares at market price, and started pushing up Asiasons’ share price thereafter. I subsequently received a cash discount at the big meeting on 26 September 2013, where [the Second Accused] handed me an envelope containing S$200,000 or S$300,000 in cash, in John’s presence.100 The Prosecution also relied on other pieces of evidence to prove the accused persons’ broader plan. They do not need to be discussed at this juncture. The testimonies of Mr Tai and Mr Leroy Lau are sufficient to illustrate the Prosecution’s case in this regard.The accused persons’ conduct after the Crash indicated their Scheme 101 I turn to the last component of the Prosecution’s case. That was the actions of the accused persons after the Crash in their efforts to deal with the fall out. Two sets of actions were salient.102 First, as stated at [18] above, following the Crash, BAL’s share prices fell, respectively, to S$0.13, S$0.15, and S$0.25 on 7 October 2013. Their respective prices right before the Crash were S$1.895, S$2.65, and S$1.42. This resulted in substantial losses being incurred in the Relevant Accounts. The FIs, unsurprisingly, began turning to the Relevant Accountholders and TRs to recover these losses. As alluded to at [65]–[68] above, the losses suffered in financed margin accounts were particularly substantial. On the Prosecution’s case, the way the accused persons – particularly the First Accused – dealt with such losses, was highly revealing of the existence of their Scheme.103 On the Prosecution’s case, the accused persons had made payment arrangements for the losses suffered in the Relevant Accounts. There was no reason for them to have undertaken such an immense responsibility unless they had been in control of the accounts and, thus, accountable to the Relevant Accountholders for their use. Once again, by way of example, Mr Jack Ng’s evidence was illustrative:

After the penny stock crash in early October 2013, I began chasing [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] and [Mr Kuan AM (“KAM”)] for outstanding contra losses in [ESA Electronics’] and KAM’s cash accounts. Around late October 2013, I contacted QSL about the settlement of outstanding losses. The other cash accounts did not have outstanding debts because the collateral in their margin accounts were sufficient to cover the losses.[ESA Electronics’] account had an outstanding loss of approximately S$1.2 million after the initial loss amount was reduced by funds in the trust account and the collateral in the margin account. KAM’s cash account had an outstanding loss of about S$0.6 million after the initial loss amount was reduced by funds in the trust account and the collateral in the margin account. I called KAM about the losses in his cash account. He told me to speak to QSL about the losses. I called QSL to discuss the [ESA Electronics’] and KAM’s losses.QSL told me to meet her at LionGold’s office at Mohammed Sultan Road. I remember going to LionGold’s office during a week day in the afternoon. There, I waited for about an hour for QSL in LionGold’s meeting room but she did not show up. Instead, a gentleman walked into the meeting room. I found him familiar and recognised him as [the First Accused (“JS”)] because I had seen photographs of him in the newspapers during the 1980s or 1980s (sic). He was a prominent figure in the stock market at that time.JS greeted me. He asked me “what is the problem” and I gave him details of the losses in [ESA Electronics’] and KAM’s cash accounts. He told me not to worry and that he would “settle everything” for me. I then asked him for his contact number, and KAM gave me two contact numbers.… Before he left, he told me “don’t worry Jack, I will settle.”[emphasis added]104 Apart from the fact of the accused persons’ coverage of the losses suffered in the Relevant Accounts, the Prosecution also relied heavily on the manner in which they went about settling such losses.

 106 As would have been gathered from the fact that the First Accused faced eight Witness Tampering Charges (see [4(e)] above), this was not the only instance of witness tampering in which the First Accused was said to have been involved. I will address the others from [1197] below. For now, it suffices to state that it was an important part of the Prosecution’s case that the First Accused had tampered with witnesses. Considered alongside the six other components of their case, the Prosecution urged me to conclude that their general thesis, as well as the specific charges which had been brought – on the totality of the evidence adduced – was proven beyond reasonable doubt.Categories of evidence relied on by the Prosecution107 On that note, and before I turn to set out the Defence’s case, it is useful to set out the broad categories of evidence relied on by the Prosecution in support of their case as a whole. Some of these have already been alluded to above in describing the various components of the Prosecution’s case. There were seven: (a) the direct oral evidence of witnesses, including Relevant Accountholders, TRs, intermediaries; (b) the communication records, which included recorded calls, messages, and emails exchanged between relevant persons in this case; (c) the spreadsheets and other documentary records which indicated the accused persons’ control and coordination of the Relevant Accounts; (d) the investigative work carried out by the CAD in relation to some of the spreadsheets, documentary records and other information; (e) the raw trading data of BAL shares obtained from the SGX; (f) certain analytical work carried out by Ms Gao

 of the Government Technology Agency (“GovTech”); and (g) the evidence of the two Prosecution expert witnesses, Professor Aitken and Mr Ellison (see [6] above). I explain each category in turn.108 First, the direct oral evidence of Relevant Accountholders, TRs, and intermediaries, amongst others. This category is self-explanatory. It simply bears repeating that out of 95 witnesses of fact, 85 witnesses gave evidence by way of conditioned statements. It should also be highlighted in this connection that, in her written closing submissions,

 I address her allegations substantively from [1469] below. But at this point, it is enough to state that I rejected her assertions. Thus, the oral evidence of the witnesses, which included their conditioned statements (s 264(1) of the CPC), was assessed in the ordinary manner.109 Second, communication records, which included recorded calls, messages, and emails exchanged between relevant persons in this case. Of particular relevance were those between the accused persons and the TRs and intermediaries. Not long after the Crash – in April 2014 – the CAD seized more than 20 electronic devices from various persons important in this matter, including the two accused persons.

 Given the length of the Relevant Period, however, such communication records were by no means “complete” in that they did not reflect every electronic exchange between and amongst the accused persons as well as every other relevant character. That said, the records that were obtained – particularly written messages – were critical and formed an objective, even if not perfect, foundation on which the investigation appeared to be built.110 As an illustration, the investigators seized a BlackBerry mobile phone from the First Accused.

ThanksOther salient communications will be set out throughout these grounds as and when it is relevant and necessary to do so.111 Third, spreadsheets and other documentary records which indicated the accused persons’ control and coordination of the Relevant Accounts. For example, a crucial document I introduced at [60] above was the Shareholding Schedule. Another vital spreadsheet was one maintained by Mr Goh HC which appeared to monitor the payment of contra losses (“Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet”). Other salient documents that bore on my decision will be referred to throughout these grounds as necessary.112 Fourth, the investigative work carried out by the CAD in relation to some of the spreadsheets, documentary records and other information. The investigators had, to a degree, verified key spreadsheets and documents that were uncovered during the investigation. For example, in respect of Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet, work was done – to the extent possible – to ascertain the specific contra losses being recorded, as well as the bank accounts from and to which payments of such losses were being made.

 I have alluded to the existence of such evidence at [58]–[59] above.113 In general, such work lent greater context to the underlying spreadsheets, documents, or communications being examined and verified. Consequently, the work performed also increased the confidence I had in the accuracy of those underlying spreadsheets, documents, or communications. 114 Fifth, the raw trading data of BAL shares obtained from the SGX. Such trading data does not require substantial explanation. In short, they were densely populated spreadsheets which reflected the entire universe of orders, amendments and deletions which were placed, as well as trades executed, during the Relevant Period. There were separate spreadsheets for each of the three counters, ie, Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold.115 The sixth category of evidence – the utility of which was fiercely contested – was certain analytical work carried out by Ms Gao of GovTech in respect of the BAL trading data as well as telecommunications records of the accused persons, Relevant Accountholders, TRs, intermediaries, amongst other relevant persons (the “GovTech Evidence”).

 Broadly, the GovTech Evidence comprised four components.(a) First, there were compilations of the telecommunications records of the accused persons, Relevant Accountholders, and TRs. These compilations captured both: (i) individual instances of phone communications which took place between the accused persons, Relevant Accountholders, and TRs;
                   277




Foot Note 277

 and (ii) the aggregate number of phone communications the accused persons had with the TRs and intermediaries.

Foot Note 278

×



  GSE-8d and GSE-9c.



 To be clear, phone communications included both calls and SMS messages, but an inherent limitation was that “communications via WhatsApp, Blackberry Messenger, and any other similar application sent and received over 4G, WiFi or any data network, [could not] be specifically identified in [the telecommunications companies’] records, and [were] therefore not captured by the [analysis]”.

  PS-95A at para 23.



(b) Second, there was an analysis of the telecommunications records between the accused persons on one end, and the TRs and intermediaries on the other. Such telecommunications records were analysed alongside the BAL trading data to determine whether (and to what extent) there had been communications between the accused persons and TRs or intermediaries shortly preceding the placement of BAL orders in the Relevant Accounts (ie, “proximate communications”).

 (d) Fourth, there was also a spreadsheet which consolidated the instances of trading activity in the Relevant Accounts which were preceded by proximate communications between the accused persons and the relevant TR. In essence, this spreadsheet contained rows of trading data, similar to that seen in the SGX exhibits mentioned at [114] above; however, the rows of trading data here only included those which had been preceded by a proximate communication between the accused persons and the relevant TR.

116 Although this category of evidence was generally useful, I should state that there were situations which produced some difficulty in terms of whether such evidence should be regarded as corroborative of the Prosecution’s case, neutral, or exculpatory of the accused persons. Simply put, there were instances in which the GovTech Evidence contradicted the primary evidence given by the TRs or Relevant Accountholders, or, even the Prosecution’s own case. In these instances, it needed to be determined whether the contradiction was of such extent and character that it called into question the veracity of the primary evidence given by the witnesses (as well as the inferences to be drawn therefrom); or, whether the primary evidence could accommodate a reasonable explanation of the contradiction. Connectedly, if the witnesses’ primary evidence could not accommodate a reasonable explanation for the contradiction with the GovTech Evidence but, yet, was otherwise credible, the question that then arose was whether that called into question the reliability of the GovTech Evidence itself.117 The Defence submitted that, even if the GovTech Evidence was consistent with the principal evidence given by a particular witness, it did not possess any corroborative value because it rested on fundamentally flawed premises.

  1DCS at paras 543–570.



 Chief amongst these was the fact that the mere proximity of a communication to a BAL trade order – without any additional information about the contents of that communication – could not establish a causal connection between the communication and the trade order entered.

 Alternatively, if it was accepted that proximate communications indicated the giving of trading instructions, then, in the absence of proximate communications on particular days, it followed that no trading instructions had been given (the Defence referred to these as “Clear Days”, and I will refer to this as the “Clear Days Argument”).

118 Other criticisms of the GovTech Evidence included the following. (a) First, notwithstanding the strong assumption the GovTech Evidence was essentially making that proximate communications amounted to the giving of trade instructions, it made no allowances for error, coincidence, or innocent explanations.

 (c) Third, the GovTech Evidence was also occasionally contradictory to the primary evidence. For example, the Accused Persons’ Analysis conducted in relation to Mr Leroy Lau reflected a substantial number of proximate communications. However, Mr Leroy Lau’s own evidence was that the First Accused generally had not given him specific trading instructions, but, instead, a general objective to meet. This showed that proximate communication “hits”, contrary to the implicit suggestion made by the GovTech Evidence, did not necessarily reflect trading instructions.

 (d) Fourth, the telecommunications data used in the preparation of the GovTech Evidence did not include alternative mobile phones of crucial actors. For example, these included the disposable phones used by individuals such as Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa.

(e) Fifth, the Accused Persons’ Analysis included instances of proximate communications which were initiated by TRs with the accused persons. If the accused persons had in fact been controlling the Relevant Accounts and giving the TRs trading instructions, they should have initiated contact with the TRs. Yet, the GovTech Evidence failed to take this into consideration.

 (f) Sixth, the GovTech Evidence also counted a substantial number of text messages as proximate communications between the accused persons and TRs or intermediaries. However, if the accused persons had, in fact, been coordinating their control of the Relevant Accounts to manipulate the market for BAL shares, such coordination would naturally have been time-sensitive and, accordingly, the use of calls would have been necessary. The use of text messages thus did not cohere with the Prosecution’s picture of coordination.

119 While none of the Defence’s criticisms was unfounded, the conclusion I was urged to reach – that the GovTech Evidence was therefore of no probative value at all – was somewhat overstated. In my judgment, though the GovTech Evidence did not possess any clear primary evidential value, it had corroborative value. This was particularly so where the data was meaningfully contextualised by primary descriptions of the relationships between the accused persons, the TRs, and the Relevant Accountholders.120 Further, I also did not think that the extent of the Defence’s critique of the GovTech Evidence was ultimately necessary. The Prosecution did not take the position that the GovTech Evidence was a perfect data set, or that its premises could account for each and every situation. Indeed, Ms Sheryl Tan specifically highlighted various limitations which she assessed “may [have] work[ed] in favour of the accused persons”.

 Put simply, the Prosecution did not – in my view – seek to elevate the GovTech Evidence beyond what it was. The Prosecution did not rely on the GovTech Evidence as a first port-of-call. The starting point was always the primary evidence given by the witnesses, supported by the objective documentary records. The GovTech Evidence typically came in only after that point (though, there were exceptions to this; the most notable of which concerned the single Relevant Account managed by TR Mr Yong: see [479]–[493] below). In that sense, there was almost always something against which the GovTech Evidence could be “tested”. On the occasions that contradictions arose between the primary evidence and the GovTech Evidence (eg, on the Defence’s Clear Days Argument), such contradictions simply engaged a need for careful scrutiny of the latter. It did not, as the Defence suggested,

 necessitate disregarding the GovTech Evidence entirely.121 Finally, the last category of the evidence relied on by the Prosecution was that of their two experts. As mentioned at [6] above, Professor Aitken is the market surveillance expert, and he gave evidence, inter alia, on the effects produced by the BAL trading activity carried out in the Relevant Accounts. The valuation expert, Mr Ellison, gave evidence on the “actual” value of BAL. In summary, Professor Aitken’s analysis suggested that, if the Relevant Accounts were indeed under the control of a single actor or group of actors working in concert, those accounts had, in fact, been used to perpetuate false trading and price manipulation.

 I will set out their evidence in greater detail, respectively, at [778] and [826] below.The Defence’s case122 The main through line which ran through the Defence’s case was the accused persons’ denial that they had been in control of any of the 189 Relevant Accounts. This denial manifested in both positive and negative positions they took against the Prosecution’s case and evidence. (a) For example, a positive position taken by the Defence was that, if the markets for and prices of BAL shares had in fact been manipulated, the true wrongdoers were Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, Mr Wong XY, and “possibly others”.

 Excluding the possible but unnamed wrongdoers, it was said that these individuals had, between them, control and use of around 90 Relevant Accounts which they used to carry out illegal activities without the knowledge or involvement of the accused persons. Indeed, on the analysis of the Defence’s expert, Mr White, these accounts were responsible for most of the BAL trading activity which the Prosecution sought to impugn.

 (b) Another example of a positive explanation given by the Defence in respect of the issue of “control”, was that the First Accused had been promoting LionGold shares to the TRs. This accounted for the volume of communications between himself and many TRs, on which the Prosecution placed “heavy reliance” to establish control.

 Connectedly, the First Accused had also helped to facilitate the trading activities of certain Relevant Accounts – namely, those of his family members as well as close associates – by relaying trading instructions and arranging for the payment of losses suffered in their accounts. This was not an exercise of control over their accounts.

(c) An example of a negative position taken by the Defence was the fact that most of the Relevant Accountholders were high net-worth individuals and “people of substance”. In fact, many of them were said to have been “far more established and successful” than the First Accused. Accordingly, these persons “could not possibly” have agreed to be the accused persons’ nominees.

 (d) Another example of a negative position taken by the Defence against the Prosecution’s case was as follows. Beyond their averment that the persons such as Mr Tai, Mr Gan, etc, were the actual wrongdoers (see [122(a)] above), the accused persons also challenged the allegations made by other TRs that they had given trading instructions in respect of the remaining Relevant Accounts (ie, those which were not under the management of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, or Mr Wong XY). For example, this included TRs such as Mr Ong KC whose evidence was stated at [41]–[43] above. As regards these TRs, the Defence’s case was that the Prosecution had failed to discharge their burden of proof on account of the witnesses’ lack of credibility, the problems with the GovTech Evidence, amongst other issues.

 123 Examples such as these, however, do not capture the full breadth of the Defence’s case. Much like the Prosecution’s case, which was characterised by a substantial degree of diversity and granularity – especially in relation to how each of the Relevant Accounts had allegedly been controlled – the case for the Defence was also fairly granular. Here, I endeavour to capture the vital strands of the Defence’s case without setting out too much inundating detail. Those details will be considered when I set out my substantive analysis from [156] below.124 The Defence’s case generally targeted each of the five groups of charges separately (see [4] above). Accordingly, I set out their case as such. Before doing so, however, I ought to reiterate that the Second Accused elected not to give evidence or call any witness to her defence. A fuller discussion about the impact of her course of action is set out at [285]–[287] below. As stated at [6], only two witnesses gave evidence for the Defence – the First Accused and Mr White. As I will explain, the First Accused’s evidence chiefly revolved around giving context to the associations he had with the many individuals and companies which featured in this matter, and explanations of the evidence adduced by the Prosecution against himself and the Second Accused. In providing those explanations, the First Accused generally took positions which were consistent with the Second Accused’s interests. Simply put, this was not a case which involved a cut-throat defence. Accordingly, when I use the phrase “Defence’s case” (or any variation thereof), it generally refers to the submissions made by both accused persons, even though it only encompasses the evidence adduced by the First Accused and Mr White.The False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges125 The Defence’s case in respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges comprised five key strands. (a) First, these ten charges did not contain sufficient particulars and, as a consequence, the Defence was unable to adequately understand and meet the Prosecution’s case.

 approach in framing the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges as they did. By way of example, Charge 1 – which pertained to an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the market for Blumont shares – read:CHARGE 1That you, Soh Chee Wen, between 2 January and 15 March 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to do acts with the intention of creating a false appearance with respect to the market for the securities of Blumont Group Ltd (“Blumont”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which acts involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence between 2 January and 15 March 2013) for trading and holding Blumont securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.127 The most pertinent objections to the form of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges were threefold. (a) First, by framing the charges so broadly, the Prosecution failed to identify the specific dates, accounts, and market activity which went towards making out each charge.

 By this submission, I understood the Defence to mean that the Prosecution did not give details such as those I set out in the following segment to a hypothetical charge: “… which acts involved controlling [name specific accounts involved in the market activity being impugned] on [state date range] for carrying out [state market activity being impugned, for example, wash trading carried out on particular dates] of Blumont securities”. Without details such as these, the Defence argued, the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges could not be met.(b) Second, the Defence had asked the Prosecution on multiple occasions to particularise the charges but was met with the response that it was not necessary for them to do so. Instead, the Prosecution “insisted that every charge include[d] all the [Relevant] Accounts”, which was not and could not be true as the evidence adduced eventually showed. Moreover, the Prosecution could not be allowed to “reverse-engineer” the charges from the evidence ultimately adduced at trial because the accused persons needed, in the first place, to have clear notice of how such evidence related to the specific False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges that had been brought.

 (c) Third, the imprecise approach taken by the Prosecution prevented the court from adopting a “mathematical approach” for determining whether the impugned transactions in the Relevant Accounts, apparently controlled by the accused persons, constituted false trading or market rigging contrary to s 197(1)(b) of the SFA.

128 Resting on these objections, the Defence essentially submitted that the Prosecution could not have its cake and eat it too. As the Prosecution preferred to take a “global view”, it followed that they could only secure a conviction on the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges if they could make out their entire case. That was, that the accused persons had controlled each and every Relevant Account, and that each and every Relevant Account had been put towards the alleged Scheme. However, if the Prosecution failed in part of the case, then they failed in the whole of the case.

 I set out and deal with the Defence’s arguments in greater detail from [180]–[190] below.Other actors controlled the major Relevant Accounts129 By this strand of the Defence’s case, it was contended that the Prosecution erred in concluding that the accused persons had been the ones who controlled the Relevant Accounts in order to perpetuate their alleged Scheme. Instead, the reality was that the bulk of the trading activity carried out in all 189 accounts could be traced to accounts under the management of a few individuals – namely, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, and Mr Wong XY.

 Indeed, Mr White gave evidence that, on his analysis, the accounts managed by these individuals were responsible for approximately 75% of the BAL trading volume amongst the Relevant Accounts, and, around 47% of the BAL trading volume across the entire market, for the whole Relevant Period.

130 These individuals fell within three groups:(a) The first group comprised Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa. At the trial, they were called the “Manhattan House Group” because, sometime in 2013, they began working out of an office in Manhattan House, a building along Chin Swee Road, Singapore.

 Collectively, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa managed around 90 Relevant Accounts as TRs (in the case of Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa) and as an intermediary (in the case of Mr Tai). The BAL trades executed in the accounts under their management represented 30.02% of the total trades carried out in the market for the entire Relevant Period.

 Mr Gwee, the de facto leader of the group, was not himself the holder of any Relevant Account which formed the subject of the False Trading, Price Manipulation, or Deception Charges. However, his personal accounts had been used to trade with those under Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa’s management. The Defence’s case in respect of the Manhattan House Group was, generally, that they had coordinated and executed wash trades amongst themselves. This was done without the knowledge or involvement of the accused persons and with the goal of “churning” trades in order to earn commissions.

 (b) The second group comprised just one individual, Mr Leroy Lau. Mr Leroy Lau was a remisier with DMG & Partners. However, unlike the other TRs featured in this case, he was a day trader who operated his own trading account with substantial trading limits. On his own evidence, he traded in “very large quantities”, and there were days on which the total value of his executed trades fell within the range of S$200 million to S$300 million”.

Although the scale of his BAL trading activity was not as substantial as that of the Manhattan House Group or Mr Leroy Lau, the trades he had executed in the accounts under his management still represented 1.42% of the total volume of BAL trades executed in the entire market, for the duration of the Relevant Period.

131 To persuade the court that these other individuals were the true wrongdoers in terms of having manipulated the markets for and prices of BAL shares, the Defence’s general approach was to challenge the cogency and credibility of the accounts they gave incriminating the accused persons. Indeed, in respect of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa, the Defence took out impeachment applications. Such challenges were mounted on various grounds. For example, by: (a) highlighting inconsistencies between the accounts given by those actors and the objective evidence; (b) highlighting inconsistencies between the accounts given by those actors; (c) questioning the intentions of those actors in incriminating the accused persons; and (d) pointing out gaps in the objective evidence adduced by the Prosecution to support the accounts of these witnesses of allegedly dubious credibility. 132 The case against Mr Tai is illustrative of these grounds of challenge.(a) There were inconsistencies between Mr Tai’s account and the objective evidence. Mr Tai testified that, apart from the periods during which the accused persons had delegated their BAL “market operations”

 to make the general point that Mr Tai was not a witness of credit.(b) There were inconsistencies between Mr Tai’s account and those of other actors. Mr Tai testified that the accused persons had delegated their “market operations” to Mr Tai and Mr Gan for specific periods. In respect of Blumont, that period was said to have been from late-August until September 2013.

 Mr Tai gave evidence that, outside these periods, he had not given trading instructions to others to coordinate “market operations”, and he would have acted on the First or Second Accused’s trading instructions. However, contrary to this, Mr Tjoa’s assistant, Mr Yip,

 gave evidence that Mr Tai had called him to give trading instructions from as early as July 2012, before the Relevant Period. Mr Yip stated that Mr Tai initially probably gave such instructions around once a week. However, this rate “increased significantly” around January 2013.

 This fell outside the alleged periods of delegation and, on the Defence’s case, this supported the inference that Mr Tai had concocted the delegation of “market operations” to explain periods during which the IB and Saxo accounts traded high volumes of BAL shares without communications with the accused persons to whom instructions could be attributed.

(c) Mr Tai’s motive for giving evidence against the accused persons was corrupt. It was said that Mr Tai had carried out BAL trades in the Saxo and IB accounts under his management in order to generate commissions and, effectively, cheat the Relevant Accountholders for his own benefit. In support of this, the Defence relied on Mr Tai’s admission that he had conducted “ping-pong” trades with the accounts under Mr Tjoa’s management. That was, essentially, rolling back-and-forth contra trades between the two sets of accounts which did nothing for the accountholders other than cause them to incur transaction costs. Those costs, in turn, benefitted Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa. Mr Tai also admitted that he had been responsible for other forms of illicit trading activity to generate commissions.

(d) There were gaps in the Prosecution’s evidence. As stated at [132(a)] above, Mr Tai testified that, outside the periods during which the accused persons had allegedly delegated “market operations” to him, he would receive specific instructions from them as to the BAL trades he was to execute in the IB and Saxo accounts under his management. Yet, despite Mr Tai’s evidence that most of these instructions would have been conveyed through calls or Blackberry messages,

 the Prosecution did not adduce any such messages. This was notwithstanding the fact that the CAD had managed to “recover thousands of [Blackberry messages] between the accused persons and other parties”. Given this gap, the Defence submitted that the “only logical conclusion” was that there were, in truth, no such messages, and certainly none which would have been able to support the claims made by Mr Tai.

133 Submissions of a similar nature were made vis-à-vis Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, and Mr Wong XY. As Mr Gwee did not have any Relevant Accounts under his management (unlike the other three members of the Manhattan House Group), the arguments advanced against him were distinct but, nevertheless, connected. I have set out and dealt with the Defence’s submissions in respect of these three groups in greater detail below (in respect of the Manhattan House Group, see [648]–[726]; in respect of Mr Leroy Lau, see [308]–[322]; and in respect of Mr Wong XY, see [444]–[478]). 134 At this juncture, it suffices to state that on the footing that the Relevant Accounts which had been managed by Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, and Mr Wong XY had not been controlled by the accused persons, the Defence argued that there was not enough to establish the conspiracies alleged by the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. Take for example, Charge 1 reproduced at [126] above; it was highlighted by the Defence that the most significant party who traded in Blumont shares between 2 January and 15 March 2013 was Mr Leroy Lau. Of the total 1,474,984,000 Blumont shares that had been traded during this period, he was responsible for 307,222,000 (or 20.8%).

 Thus, if there was reasonable doubt that Mr Leroy Lau had been acting on the accused persons’ instructions, but, rather, in pursuance of his own day-trading strategies, the accused persons ought to be acquitted of this particular charge.

Control of the remaining Relevant Accounts was not made out135 Turning to the remaining Relevant Accounts (other than those managed by Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Leroy Lau, and Mr Wong XY), it was also the Defence’s case that the Prosecution had failed to prove control of them. The Defence sought to demonstrate the weaknesses in the Prosecution’s case through various means. Two examples were stated at [122(c)] and [122(d)] above. As the arguments raised in this connection were highly dependent on each particular Relevant Account, I will return to them when I turn to the issue of control at [194] below.The Prosecution failed to prove the conspiracies alleged136 The fourth strand of the Defence’s arguments against the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges was that the Prosecution did not satisfactorily establish that the accused persons “masterminded” the Scheme alleged. That the accused persons had not masterminded the Scheme and, therefore, had not entered into the conspiracies forming the subject of the charges was particularly evident from two matters.(a) First, the fact that the accused persons had themselves suffered millions in losses as a consequence of the Crash.
                   355




Foot Note 355

  1DCS at para 571.



 I understood this argument to be that it was not logical to suggest that the accused persons had entered into conspiracies which ultimately caused harm to themselves. To accept such a conclusion would be to illogically conclude that they had conspired against their own interests. (b) Second, Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold had been, during the Relevant Period, companies of genuine value. Their shares do not “fit the bill of manipulated shares”.

 The import of this point was that it was not logical for the accused persons to have conspired to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares when there was no need for them to do so. The companies could and would have risen in value. 137 I address the first argument when I draw all my findings together in respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges at [889]–[894] below. However, as regards the contention that BAL were companies of “genuine value”, that is an issue I address from [826]–[844] below when discussing the expert evidence of Mr Ellison. The accused persons did not cause the Crash138 As alluded to at [19] above, it was the Defence’s case that they did not cause the Crash. Primarily, of course, this position was premised on their very denial of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. If the Defence had succeeded in that regard, it logically followed that the accused persons could not be said to have “caused” the Crash.

 However, the Defence’s argument went beyond that. I understood their submission to be that, even if the accused persons were convicted of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, they were nevertheless not the cause of the Crash because they had not done anything to trigger it.

 Instead, there were several other triggers, chief amongst which were the SGX’s query on 1 October 2013 (see [14] above) as well as its decision to designate BAL shares in the manner it did (see [17] above). There were also others to blame – namely, UOB, because it was the first to designate BAL shares, which applied downward pressure; the SIAS for its publication (see [15] above); and Goldman Sachs for making a substantial margin call on BAL shares.

 At [888] and [1299]–[1306] below, I set out and address this aspect of the Defence’s case in greater detail. The Deception Charges 139 In respect of the Deception Charges generally, the Defence advanced one principal argument – this being that the charges did not contain sufficient particulars and could, therefore, not be answered. The Defence’s charge-specific arguments were organised around two groups: the Foreign Accounts and the Local Accounts. 140 At the risk of stating the obvious, I should highlight that the accused persons’ alleged control of the Relevant Accounts, raised in connection with the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, bore on the Deception Charges. After all, the fact of such control formed the foundations on which it could be asserted that the FIs had been deceived as to the accused persons’ involvement in the instructing of BAL orders and trades in the Relevant Accounts. Without establishing control or at least “involvement” more generally, it could not be said that the FIs had been deceived as to anything. The charges lacked particulars141 Using Charge 24 as an example, the Deception Charges read:CHARGE 24That you, Soh Chee Wen, from 1 August 2012 to 3 October 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under section 201(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to engage in a practice which was likely to operate as a deception upon Interactive Brokers LLC (the “Firm”), directly in connection with the purchase or sale of shares in Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd (the “Securities”), bodies corporate whose shares were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, a securities exchange in Singapore, which practice was to conceal the involvement of you and Quah in the instructing of orders and trades of the Securities in the account of one Peter Chen Hing Woon (account no. U1092337) maintained with the Firm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.[emphasis added]142 The thrust of the Defence’s submission that the Deception Charges did not contain sufficient particulars was as follows:

 The Prosecution did not set out details in respect of how the accused persons were said to have “concealed” their “involvement” in the “instructing of orders and trades” in the Relevant Accounts. As noted at [49] above, the Prosecution’s case in respect of the issue of control comprised many permutations.

 For example, with respect to some Relevant Accounts, it was said that the accused persons gave direct instructions to the TRs without being formally authorised to do so. In respect of others, it was said that the accused persons relayed instructions through accountholders and, thus, had concealed their involvement in that way. Where Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, and Mr Gan were concerned, the accused persons were also alleged to have been “involved” through these individuals as delegates. Such specifics, however, as may be seen from the charge reproduced above, were not set out in each Deception Charge. 143 I explain and address this argument in greater detail at [948]–[957].Case in respect of the Foreign Accounts144 In respect of the Deception Charges pertaining to the Foreign Accounts, the Defence advanced two arguments of general applicability across all 49 charges which concerned Foreign Accounts (out of the 161 Deception Charges):

(a) First, that the instructions the accused persons supposedly gave would have been either: (i) conveyed to the foreign FIs’ trading desk through an authorised person (that was, the intermediaries holding LPOAs); or (ii) entered online by intermediaries. Thus, the Defence said, the foreign FIs could not have been “deceived” because the FIs did not and would not have looked further than the fact that the instructions had been given by an authorised intermediary. Moreover, there was no suggestion that the accused persons had falsely represented any state of affairs to the FIs.

 (b) Second, that trades which had been carried out in the Foreign Accounts would have been performed as part of each account’s portfolio construction discussed between the foreign FI, the intermediary and the accountholder. Accordingly, the FIs could not have been deceived since they would have known from the outset the portfolio that was to be constructed by the intermediary, and the steps which would have been required to get to that portfolio.

 As regards Mr Yong, he was unable to give evidence physically in court and the Defence exercised its objection to him testifying by way of video-link. Given the specificity of the Defence’s arguments in respect of the Deception Charges, they are set out and dealt with together with my substantive analysis from [988] below.147 More generally, the Defence also argued that many (though not all) of the Deception Charges pertaining to Local Accounts had not been made out because the FIs had not been “deceived”. More specifically, these were the charges concerning local FIs whose TRs had been aware of the accused persons’ “involvement” in the instructing of orders and trades in the Relevant Accounts. One example is Mr Jack Ng, mentioned at [40] and [44] above. As there existed agent-principal relationships between the TRs and the FIs, the Defence contended that the knowledge of those TRs ought to be attributed to their principal FIs. If knowledge were to be attributed, the FIs could be said to have known of the accused persons’ involvement. As such, they could not have been “deceived”.

 I set out and address this submission in greater detail at [990]–[1003] below.The Cheating Charges 148 The operative allegation in the Cheating Charges was that the accused persons dishonestly concealed that they had been “engaging in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance in the market for BAL [shares]”. As such, the Defence’s basic position in respect of these charges was that, if they were acquitted of the False Trading Charges, the Cheating Charges automatically failed as well.

 149 In the alternative, the Defence had three broad submissions:(a) First, the accused persons could not be said to have exercised a deception on either Goldman Sachs or IB. A deception “would have [had] to be by way of words or acts that conveyed a falsehood, or omissions that failed to convey a truth”.
                   377

 It was not the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had made positive false representations and, thus, only omissions were in issue.

Foot Note 378

×



  1DCS at para 643.



 However, to establish that there was an impugnable omission, it was insufficient for the Prosecution to assert that the accused persons had failed to “tell” Goldman Sachs or IB that they had been manipulating the markets for BAL shares. This was because, for an omission to amount to deception, “there must [have] either [been] a duty to act in a particular manner or to state a particular fact, or there must [have been] circumstances where silence [was] in itself a statement. None of that [was] the case here”.

 gave evidence for Goldman Sachs that, before a share was accepted as collateral, it had to be assessed by Goldman Sachs’ “PRISM” system, which “measures various collateral eligibility criteria … including liquidity, volatility, portfolio concentration, minimum price levels and minimum market capitalisation levels”.

 As against such sophisticated systems of assessment, neither positive misrepresentations nor omissions, would have had any effect on the FIs’ decision to extend financing. The FIs would have “extended financing on their own accord, based on their own expert assessment” of the potential shares to be put up as collateral.

150 I address the Defence’s first submission at [1117]–[1124] below with my explanation of the elements which the Prosecution needed to prove in order to establish the Cheating Charges. The second and third arguments are set out in greater detail and addressed together with my substantive analysis of the individual charges from [1125]–[1156] below.The Company Management Charges151 As regards the Company Management Charges, the First Accused’s position varied for Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold. In respect of Blumont, his evidence was that he only acted as an informal advisor to the company’s Executive Chairman, Mr Neo.

 152 Where LionGold was concerned, the First Accused’s position was somewhat more nuanced. The First Accused denied that he had been involved in the “running and operations” of the company.

 This, the First Accused argued, was not conduct which fell afoul of s 148(1) of the Companies Act. Specifically, it was submitted that the prohibition contemplated cases in which creditors and stakeholders do not have visibility into the operations of the company such that a discharged bankrupt’s involvement puts them at risk. Such concerns did not apply to public-listed companies such as LionGold, where there were strict accounting, auditing, and compliance requirements in place.

In respect of all four, the Defence took out applications to impeach their credibility.

 From [1197]–[1288] below, I will state and address the evidence and arguments relevant to these charges. The Prosecution misconducted the case155 Before leaving my summary of the Defence’s case, it is essential to note that in mounting their defence, the accused persons made several allegations of misconduct and case mismanagement against the Prosecution as well as the investigating authorities. To be fair, I should state that the extent to which these allegations were made differed between the two accused persons. However, as they did not bear on my decision on criminal liability, it is sufficient just to note at this point that there were such allegations. I will set out and address them from [1460]–[1488] below.False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges156 Before I set out my analysis proper, I begin with a preface. Cases involving allegations of conspiracy are exercises in reconstruction. Indeed, oftentimes, multiple scenes need to be reconstructed. In approaching an exercise like this, one certainly needs to examine the evidence systematically. However, while people, documents, and real evidence do provide information, they often do not tell complete stories. The interests of individual actors, their knowledge (or lack thereof), as well as the degree of openness with which they approach disclosure, tends to result in fragmented accounts with some truths, some untruths, and some potential truths that are difficult to prove one way or the other. The more complex the case, the more one needs to approach the exercise with careful scrutiny as to who and what to believe. That said, in reconstructing events from their remnant pieces and fragmented witness accounts, one can also hardly go without drawing informed inferences about how those events transpired. Thus, the two perspectives must be balanced.The charges157 The False Trading Charges against the First Accused are set out below. I do not reproduce the corresponding False Trading Charges against the Second Accused as they are materially identical to those brought against the First Accused:CHARGE 1That you, Soh Chee Wen, between 2 January and 15 March 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter

to engage in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the market for the securities of LionGold Corp Ltd (“LionGold”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which course of conduct involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence between 18 March and 3 October 2013) for trading and holding LionGold securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.[emphasis added]158 The two Price Manipulation Charges which concern the conspiracies to support the price of Blumont and Asiasons shares, read:CHARGE 3That you, Soh Chee Wen, between 2 and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to cause certain acts to be done, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the price of the securities of Blumont Group Ltd (“Blumont”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which acts involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence between 2 and 3 October 2013) for trading in order to support the price of Blumont securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.CHARGE 7That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 1 and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to cause certain acts to be done, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the price of the securities of Asiasons Capital Limited (“Asiasons”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which acts involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence between 1 and 3 October 2013) for trading in order to support the price of Asiasons securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.[emphasis added]159 The other two Price Manipulation Charges, which were for manipulating the prices of Asiasons and LionGold shares, were as follows:CHARGE 6That you, Soh Chee Wen, in September 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to engage in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the price of the securities of Asiasons Capital Limited (“Asiasons”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which course of conduct involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence in September 2013) for trading in order to manipulate the price of Asiasons securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.CHARGE 10That you, Soh Chee Wen, in August and September 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under 197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to engage in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the price of the securities of LionGold Corp Ltd (“LionGold”), a body corporate whose securities were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, which course of conduct involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A and which were in existence in August and September 2013) for trading in order to manipulate the price of LionGold securities, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.[emphasis added]160 I pause to highlight that Charges 1, 4 and 8 fall within the version of s 197(1)(b) in force prior to the amendments brought about on 18 March 2013 by the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Act 2012 (No 34 of 2012) (the “SFA amendments”). The other seven charges relate to periods following the amendments. With the charges in mind, I turn to the applicable legal principles.The applicable legal principlesCriminal conspiracy161 The relevant version of s 120A(1) of the Penal Code (ie, that was in force from 1 August 2012 to 3 October 2013) provides: Definition of criminal conspiracy120A.—(1) When 2 or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done —(a) an illegal act; or(b) an act, which is not illegal, by illegal means,such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof. It should be noted that this provision has been repealed and re-enacted by s 36 of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (No 15 of 2019) (“CLRA 2019”).162 Participation in a criminal conspiracy is, in and of itself, an offence. As such, given that all ten False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges were criminal conspiracy charges, all the Prosecution needed to prove in respect of each, was the fact that the accused persons had agreed to commit the offence described in each charge: NMMY Momin v The State of Maharashtra (1971) Cri LJ 793 at 796, cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [75]–[76].163 That said, it is also trite that there is almost never any direct evidence of parties entering into and setting out the objects of their conspiracy. This case was no exception. Accordingly, although the inquiry was technically whether an agreement existed, in answering this question, I invariably needed to examine the conduct of the accused persons to determine whether an agreement could be inferred. Such an inference “would [have] be[en] justified only if it [was] inexorable and irresistible, and account[ed] for all the facts of the case”: Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor [2000] 1 SLR(R) 756 (“Er Joo Nguang”) at [35], repeated in Hwa Lai Heng Ricky v Public Prosecutor [2005] SGHC 195 at [33]. False trading and marketing rigging transactions164 I turn then to the principles underlying an offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. These principles were necessary to determine whether any agreement that had been entered into by the accused persons was to do acts which would have substantively amounted to an offence under s 197(1)(b). In this regard, there were two broad questions to be determined. First, what the elements of a s 197(1)(b) offence were, both before and after the SFA Amendments. Second, what it meant to create a false appearance as to the “market” and, separately, “price”.(1) Elements of s 197(1)(b) offence prior to SFA Amendments165 I begin with the elements for the offence of false trading under s 197(1) prior to the SFA Amendments. This version of the provision read:False trading and market rigging transactions197.—(1) No person shall create, or do anything that is intended or likely to create a false or misleading appearance —(a) of active trading in any securities on a securities market; or(b) with respect to the market for, or the price of, such securities.166 A plain reading of this provision suggested there were three potential means by which an accused person could commit an offence. First, by actually creating a false or misleading appearance in respect of either the trading activity of, the market for, or the price of the security in question (the “first limb”). Second, by doing anything intended to create such an appearance (the “second limb”). Finally, by doing anything likely to create such an appearance (the “third limb”).167 In respect of Charges 1, 4, and 8 (see [157] above), the Prosecution opted to rely on the second limb. It thus needed to prove that an accused person did certain “acts” with the intention of creating a false appearance with respect to the market for BAL shares. There was no need to prove that the acts were likely to create such an appearance, much less that they did in fact create such a false appearance. This view was supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in Tan Chong Koay and another v Monetary Authority of Singapore [2011] 4 SLR 348 (“Tan Chong Koay (CA)”) at [43]–[53], in particular [44].168 However, a consequence of the Prosecution’s choice to pursue criminal conspiracy charges on the second limb of s 197(1)(b) of the pre-amendment SFA – which requires proof of intent – was that the accused persons’ guilt in respect of these three False Trading Charges, essentially turned on two levels of inference. The first was a basic inference from the accused persons’ conduct that they agreed to do certain acts. Determining the existence of specific intent was, plainly, also an inferential question: see, eg, the observation in Tan Joo Cheng v Public Prosecutor [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219 at [12]. Thus, the second inference which needed to be drawn, on top of the first, was that in agreeing to do those acts, the accused persons’ intention was to create a false appearance as to the market for BAL shares. I was mindful of these two specific inferences which needed to be drawn, and I bore them in mind when arriving at my decision on each of the Conspiracy Charges.169 To summarise, to establish Charges 1, 4, and 8, there must have been sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused persons had entered into an agreement to do “acts” and, that, in agreeing to do those acts, the accused persons’ intention was to create a false appearance as to the market for BAL shares.170 However, the level of “intent” that the Prosecution needed to prove in order to establish liability was not wholly clear. In Monetary Authority of Singapore v Tan Chong Koay and another [2011] 1 SLR 348, Lai Siu Chiu J suggested that, in order for liability to attach under the provision’s second limb, it needed to be shown that “the sole or dominant intention of the party charged … was to set or maintain a certain price of a security” [emphasis added] (at [67]). She derived this proposition from North and others v Marra Developments Limited (1981) 148 CLR 42 (“North”) at 59, a decision of the High Court of Australia, as well as Fame Decorators Agencies Pty Ltd v Jeffries Industries Ltd (1998) 28 ACSR 58 (“Fame Decorators”) at 62–63, a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. North and Fame Decorators pertained to the now-defunct s 998(1) of the Corporations Law (Cth), with which s 197(1) of our SFA was in pari materia (at least before the SFA Amendments were brought about). The Court of Appeal in Tan Chong Koay (CA) did not disturb Lai J’s statement, but it also did not specifically comment on this.171 Given that the Court of Appeal did not address this point, I did not regard myself as being bound by Lai J’s statement. Respectfully, I disagreed with her suggestion. In my view, neither North nor Fame Decorators purported to lay down the general proposition that s 998(1) required proof that the wrongdoer had the sole or dominant intention to create a false appearance as to the market or price of the shares in question. Instead, the courts there appeared simply to be finding, as a matter of fact, that the cases before them involved acts carried out with such sole or dominant intent. In my view, s 197(1)(b) of the SFA simply required “intention” in the ordinary sense, understandable by reference to the usual authorities (see, eg, Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor [2010] 4 SLR 1119 at [88] and Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor [2018] 5 SLR 449 at [36]–[37]). There was nothing about the text of the provision which required that such intention be “sole” or “dominant”.(2) Elements of s 197(1)(b) offence after SFA Amendments172 I turn then to the elements of the remaining three False Trading Charges which concerns the post-amendment version of s 197(1)(b) of the SFA:False trading and market rigging transactions197.—(1) No person shall do any thing, cause any thing to be done or engage in any course of conduct, if his purpose, or any of his purposes, for doing that thing, causing that thing to be done or engaging in that course of conduct, as the case may be, is to create a false or misleading appearance —(a) of active trading in any securities on a securities market; or(b) with respect to the market for, or the price of, such securities.173 As with the pre-amendment version of s 197(1)(b), there were also three means by which a person could commit an offence under this provision: (a) by doing anything; (b) causing any thing to be done; or (c) engaging in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false or misleading appearance. It will be noticed from this change that the amended provision imposed a mens rea element on all three limbs by requiring all forms of actus rei to be carried out with, at least, a purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance, even if that was not the accused person’s sole or dominant purpose. By contrast, an intention to create a false or misleading appearance was not required by the first and third limbs of the older provision. That is, if it was shown that the act done actually created, or was likely to create, such an appearance, this was sufficient to make out the offence (see Tan Chong Koay (CA) at [32]).174 As such, similar to the pre-amendment charges, the Prosecution needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons agreed to undertake a “course of conduct” or “cause certain acts to be done”. However, unlike the pre-amendment charges, the Prosecution only needed to prove that one of their purposes for the agreement – inferable from the surrounding evidence – in pursuing that course of conduct or causing those acts to be done, was the creation of a false appearance as to the market for or price of BAL shares.175 There were two further points which arose in respect of the principles applicable to the post-amendment version of s 197(1)(b). First, although the phrase “course of conduct” was added, it was not given any statutory definition. However, as there was nothing ambiguous about the phrase, it could be given its natural meaning; that was, the accused persons carried out a series of acts which could collectively be said to form a unified course with some centrality and continuity of purpose. 176 Second, the First Accused submitted that there was a distinction between “purpose” and “intent”.

 He argued that “intent” was wider than “purpose” because it did not require that the actor possess a “conscious desire” to achieve a particular end. By this argument, the First Accused seemed to be making two successive points. The first was that, when an individual acts with “purpose”, which was said to be narrower than “intent”, he necessarily acts with “intent”. I was prepared to accept this as it was supported by Tan Chong Koay (CA), where the Court of Appeal stated that, “if a defendant does an act with the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance … his actions must necessarily be intentional. A purpose is a desired goal or objective, and a person cannot effectuate a purpose without doing an intentional act to achieve it. To prove the absence of a specific ‘purpose’ must therefore be equivalent to proving the absence of a specific ‘intention’” (at [49]).177 However, the second point which follows from the First Accused’s argument was that, where a person acts with “intent”, he does not necessarily act with “purpose”. The First Accused seemed to make this point to the end of increasing the threshold which needed to be met for the Prosecution to establish mens rea under the post-amendment s 197(1). Although I appreciated that the word “purpose” may, in common parlance, connote a stronger sense of “motive” (or “conscious desire” as the First Accused put it) than “intent”, this in my view, was an extremely technical argument. As stated at [168] above, a finding that someone has acted with “intent” was a matter of inference, and, so too was the finding that he acted with a particular “purpose”. Where such inferences were to be drawn from the state of affairs, ie, false appearances as to the market or price of shares, it was rather contrived to suggest that there was an analytical difference in assessing the existence of these two ostensibly different states of mind. Indeed, if it was found that a false appearance as to the market was created intentionally, it could scarcely be maintained that the creator(s) of such false appearance did not purposefully bring about such appearance. As such, the elements to be proven in respect of the False Trading Charges for periods after the SFA Amendments, as well as the Price Manipulation Charges (all of which concerned periods after the amendments) were simply those stated at [174] above.(3) Meaning of false appearance as to “market” and “price”178 It is useful to also address the meaning of a false appearance as to the “market” as well as “price”. The Prosecution submitted, relying on various authorities, that a false or misleading appearance as to the “market for” securities would arise “where there [was] any artificial distortion of the true forces of supply and demand in the financial market for that security”.

 In assessing whether there was an artificial distortion, the Prosecution suggested that the court ought to look to whether an accused person, by his trading activity, was pursuing a legitimate commercial objective. Similarly, relying on Tan Chong Koay (CA), the Prosecution submitted that where “trades [were] conducted not for the primary purpose of genuine investment but for some extraneous purpose of setting or maintaining the market price, this [would] amount to a false or misleading appearance in the price”.

179 The Defence did not suggest a different interpretation of these aspects of s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. In my view, the Prosecution’s submissions accurately represented the law. However, as far as the present case was concerned, the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges were conspiracy charges premised on s 197(1)(b). As discussed, these charges could be made out so long as the accused persons had agreed to perform acts or engage in a course of conduct with the intention (or purpose) of creating a false market or appearance as to price. This being so, whether a false market or a false appearance as to the price of BAL shares had actually been created by the accused persons, was slightly beside the point. As discussed at [177] above, if a false market or false appearances had in fact been created, then such fact would have supported the inference that the accused persons had possessed such an intention (or purpose). However, such intention (or purpose) could be inferred from more than this, which was, in and of itself, not an element of the present charges.Preliminary issue: Whether the charges were sufficiently particularised180 Before turning to the factual issues, I address the preliminary but fundamental objection raised by the Defence to the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. As set out from [126]–[128] above, the Defence submitted that these ten charges lacked particularity,

 and, as a consequence, if the Prosecution was unable to establish the broad allegations made in the charges in their entirety, then the accused persons ought to be acquitted. 181 In greater detail, the Defence’s arguments were as follows.(a) The First Accused submitted that “it [was] clear from the case law that the approach to be taken in determining if there [had been] market manipulation [was] a mathematical one, and require[d] that the Prosecution particularise the charges in detail”.

 In respect of s 197(1)(b) offences which concerned price, the First Accused cited Public Prosecutor v Wong Leon Keat [2021] SGDC 53 (“Wong Leon Keat”); and for those which concern the market for shares, he cited Public Prosecutor v Ng See Kim Kelvin and another [2012] SGDC 141 (“Kelvin Ng”). The Second Accused did not rely on any particular authority but instead made the more general submission that, given the manner in which the Prosecution has framed its case, it needed to prove that the accused persons, amongst other things, “had knowledge of, and gave instructions for, each and every [trade] … [taking place] in … BAL shares in all 189 [Relevant Accounts]”.

 in respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. That was, either the whole of the Prosecution’s case on the basis of all 189 Relevant Accounts was proven, or it was not. Accordingly, if the Prosecution only succeeded in proving that some of these 189 Relevant Accounts had been controlled, the accused persons could not be convicted of these charges because it was “impossible to determine whether what [was] left ma[d]e out the charges, given that no specific activities have been particularised”.

 It bears stating that the First Accused focused on the general control of all 189 Relevant Accounts, and he did not go so far as to say that the Prosecution needed to prove each and every BAL trade executed in the 189 Relevant Accounts. This was the Second Accused’s submission.

182 I did not accept these arguments. The Prosecution proceeded on charges for criminal conspiracy and, as stated, such charges could be made out so long as the accused persons agreed to perform acts or engage in courses of conduct with the intention (or purpose) of creating false markets or false appearances as to the prices of BAL shares. Although showing that the accused persons had used specific accounts in specific ways to place specific trades would naturally have bolstered the Prosecution’s case, that was their evidential case, not the strict legal case they needed to make out on the charges brought. After all, such a degree of specificity simply was not required to establish a conspiracy to commit an offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA.183 The foregoing discussion covers the points of law needed to address the accused persons’ liability for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges – bearing in mind that these were charges for criminal conspiracy. It was not, however, enough to deal with the potential extent of their liability in the event that they were convicted. 184 Notwithstanding that the Prosecution ultimately preferred criminal conspiracy charges against the accused persons, it was, nevertheless, their case that the accused persons had successfully carried out the conspiracies which underpinned the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. This was a position they took both before and after the amendment of the charges from charges for abetment by conspiracy to charges for criminal conspiracy (see [21] above). Indeed, when they applied to amend the charges, I specifically asked the Prosecution to consider making express reference to the punishment provision, s 109 of the Penal Code, to make clear that it was their case that the s 197(1)(b) offences had been committed (on this, also see [1319]–[1339] below). As can be seen from [157]–[159] above, references to s 109 were included. Having included this reference in each of these charges, it was clear that the Prosecution not only intended to prove that the accused persons had conspired, but that they had managed to carry out their conspiracies.185 In this connection, the question which then arose was whether the Defence’s submissions that there were “insufficient particulars” undermined the method by which the Prosecution sought to prove that the conspiracies had, in fact, been carried out (as opposed to the conspiracies merely having been entered into). In my view, the answer was still “no”. As discussed from [164]–[177] above, a substantive offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, whether before or after the SFA Amendments, could be committed merely by doing acts or undertaking a course of conduct with the requisite intention (or purpose) to create a false market or appearance as to price. A false appearance did not actually need to have been created. Accordingly, though cases such as Wong Leon Keat, Kelvin Ng, and indeed, even Tan Chong Koay (CA), had approached this offence by examining narrow sets of specific trades, this was not strictly necessary to determine liability. Such examination of specific trades was only relevant in so far as it shed light on what the accused persons intended to do by those trades.186 This was clear from Tan Chong Koay (CA). The appellants in that case were Dr Tan Chong Koay (“Dr Tan”) and Pheim Asset Management Sdn Bhd (“Pheim Malaysia”). Dr Tan was the founder, CEO, and chairman of the investment committees of two companies, Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Asset Management (Asia) Pte Ltd (“Pheim Singapore”). He was also their largest shareholder. Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore were licensed fund managers in Malaysia and Singapore, respectively. At all material times, Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore had accounts holding shares of a company called United Envirotech Ltd (“UET”). In total, at the close of trading on 27 December 2004, the Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore accounts held 16,604,000 UET shares. This date was significant because the trades in contravention of s 197(1)(b) of the SFA took place on 29, 30 and 31 December 2004. On these three days, near the close of each trading day, Dr Tan instructed the purchase of UET shares for Pheim Malaysia. In total, 360,000 UET shares were purchased. As a result, UET’s share price rose by about 17%, closing at S$0.38 on 27 December 2004 before Dr Tan’s purchases, and at S$0.445 on 31 December 2004. Given their holding of 16,604,000 UET shares, Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore enjoyed a net asset value (“NAV”) increase of S$1,086,989. With this boost, the two companies outperformed their year-end benchmarks, and earned an additional S$50,000 in fees. This mode of false trading is generally known as “painting the tape” or “marking the close”.

187 The Court of Appeal found from the pattern of trading, that Dr Tan’s primary purpose was to increase the NAV of certain funds managed by Pheim Malaysia and Pheim Singapore which held UET shares. It therefore found both Dr Tan and Pheim Malaysia to have been in breach, specifically, of the second limb of s 197(1)(b) and maintained the fine of S$250,000 imposed by Lai J in the High Court. The court expressly declined to consider whether the acts of Dr Tan and Pheim Malaysia created or were likely to create a false appearance under the first and third limbs of s 197(1)(b) as it was not necessary for those questions to be answered (see Tan Chong Koay (CA) at [28]–[31]).188 From this, it can be seen that the offence under s 197(1)(b) – whether prior to or following the SFA Amendments – could be made out with or without proof of the likely or actual impact on the market. Thus, to bring the accused persons’ cases within s 109 of the Penal Code, it was, again, sufficient for the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons not only agreed to commit an offence under s 197(1)(b), but in fact undertook a course of conduct with the requisite intention (or purpose). This may benefit from proving that the accused persons controlled all 189 Relevant Accounts and were responsible for each and every BAL trade executed in those accounts. However, the existence of a particular intention (or purpose) was a matter to be inferred (as stated at [168] and [177] above). Thus, it was a question of how much and how far the Prosecution wished to go to prove its case (and I shall turn to the evidence shortly). Certainly, the requisite intention (or purpose) could be inferred from less than proof of involvement in each and every BAL trade.189 Before I leave this point, however, I must state that the Defence’s submissions on the need to pinpoint each and every trade in the Relevant Accounts and prove that the accused persons were behind those individual trades, were not entirely irrelevant. As just explained, they did not show that the Prosecution’s case could not be made out under s 109 of the Penal Code. However, they did raise another point which also related to the extent of the accused persons’ liability. This point arose because, the bare finding that the accused persons had successfully carried out the substantive offences under the second limb of s 197(1)(b) did not paint the full picture as regards the accused persons’ responsibility for the Scheme in its entirety. This is why, at [1307] below, I will return to the volume of trades actually attributable to the accused persons.190 I have dealt with the Defence’s submissions as to the lack of particularity at length because it is necessary to ensure that the three issues touched upon by those submissions are properly disentangled. The first issue was whether there was sufficient evidence to establish the conspiracies which constituted those charges. The second issue was whether there was, additionally, sufficient evidence to establish not only the conspiracies which constituted those charges, but also the underlying substantive offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. The third issue, which only arose if the Prosecution had proved not only the conspiracies but also the underlying substantive offences, was the extent to which the accused persons could be held responsible for the BAL trades carried out in the Relevant Accounts. Arguably, it was only in respect of the third issue that the highly granular analysis suggested by the Defence (see [181(a)]–[181(b)] above) was even potentially necessary (see [1307]–[1316] below). At this juncture, however, for the purpose of addressing the accused persons’ liability for the False Trading and Price Manipulation, there is no need to delve into such granularity. I accordingly turn to my reasons for convicting the accused persons of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges.Overview of the factual issues191 As would have been gathered from the manner in which the Prosecution’s case was set out from [25]–[106] above, the approach which the Prosecution took to establish the conspiracies forming the subject matter of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, was to prove the individual components of what they said constituted the accused persons’ overarching Scheme. Collectively, these components sought to support the general inference that the accused persons not only had such a Scheme, but that they had also successfully implemented it to highly damaging ends.192 This approach was sound. As I have stated repeatedly from [161]–[190] above, the key elements of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges were largely matters of inference. Inferential questions, particularly in inordinately complex cases like this, are best answered by systematically building up the factual premises from which the ultimate inference is to be drawn. To this end, my grounds will address the following questions in sequence:(a) First, whether the accused persons exercised control over the Relevant Accounts during the Relevant Period and, if so, to what extent they exercised such control. This was the foundational issue upon which all others were built. (b) Second, on the basis that the accused persons had controlled the Relevant Accounts, whether they had coordinated and managed their use of these accounts, and, if so, how they did so. (c) Third, with control and coordination established, whether the accused persons had used abusive and illegitimate trading practices in the Relevant Accounts to inflate the liquidity and price of BAL shares.(d) Fourth, as regards the inflated liquidity of BAL shares, if the accused persons had used abusive and illegitimate trading practices to that end, to what extent the markets for BAL shares were artificially created by the accused persons’ actions.(e) Fifth, as regards the inflated prices of BAL shares, if the accused persons had used abusive and illegitimate trading practices to that end, to what degree the prices of BAL shares were inflated as a consequence of the accused persons’ actions.(f) Sixth, if, having put into effect a complex scheme to inflate the liquidity and prices of BAL shares, whether the accused persons had any broader objectives for the Scheme beyond the fact of such inflation, and, if so, what those objectives were.(g) Finally, in the period after the Crash, whether the accused persons conducted themselves in a way which suggested that they in fact operated the Scheme.193 I will set out my answers to each of these seven questions in turn, and, from [889]–[894] below, I will draw these individual answers together to explain my general conclusion that the accused persons had indeed conspired to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period. This, however, does not specifically address each of the six False Trading and four Price Manipulation Charges brought against the accused persons. Thus, from [895]–[942] below, I will state my narrower conclusions in respect of each and every one of those ten charges.Issue 1: Did the accused persons control the Relevant Accounts?194 The most foundational aspect of the Prosecution’s case in respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges was that the accused persons had controlled the Relevant Accounts to effect the Scheme. 195 To be clear, the general concept of control as far as the Prosecution’s substantive case on liability was concerned, was that the accused persons could and did use the Relevant Accounts in furtherance of their Scheme. The actual manner in which they had allegedly exercised control over and used these accounts to trade in BAL shares varied between accounts. The Prosecution advanced three main methods, which, on their case, had been deployed either individually or in combination in respect of each Relevant Account.(a) First, in respect of Relevant Accounts held with local FIs (ie, the Local Accounts), it was broadly the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had directly instructed the TRs (see [34]–[36] and [40]–[43] above).(b) Second, in respect of certain Local Accounts, and all Relevant Accounts held with foreign FIs (ie, the Foreign Accounts), the Prosecution’s position was that the accused persons had either given instructions to a Relevant Accountholder or intermediary who would enter the instructed order online (those falling within this category were only Mr Leroy Lau’s personal account

Preliminary sub-issue: The accused persons’ mobile phone numbers197 Before turning to my analysis of the individual Relevant Accounts, I should highlight that there were disputes about three mobile phone numbers that the accused persons were said to have used to contact TRs, intermediaries, and other persons. (a) The first was the 3611 number (see [83(c)] above). The Prosecution’s case was that the mobile phone bearing this number had been used by the First Accused.

 I will state the First Accused’s explanation of how this number had been used by persons other than the Second Accused at [211] below.198 In sum, my findings were:(a) The 3611 number had been used by the First Accused. I did not conclude that he had necessarily been the exclusive user in the sense that no one else could have used the mobile phone.

 In the face of such overwhelming testimony pointing towards the conclusion, there was no reasonable doubt that the 678 number had been used by the First Accused. Moreover, unlike the 3611 number, I did find that there was enough to conclude that he had been its exclusive user. Several pieces of objective evidence pointed towards that conclusion; for example, the communications records for the 678 number reflected that there were roaming calls made from the number when the First Accused was in Singapore.

 This undermined the First Accused’s claim that he would leave the phone bearing this number in Malaysia when he travelled. However, the most persuasive evidence, in my view, was the fact that this number had been used to exchange highly personal messages between the First Accused and Ms Cheng during the course of their romantic relationship.

 However, that missed the point. It was simply unbelievable that he would have left the phone bearing the 678 number with others in the first place when it had been used for such a purpose.(c) The 6861 number had been used solely by the Second Accused. For my reasons on this, I refer to [211]–[216] below, where I discuss the issue alongside a substantive defence raised by the First Accused in connection with certain Relevant Accounts held by Mr Chen. Grouping of the Relevant Accounts for determining control199 It is not feasible to discuss the accused persons’ alleged control over the Relevant Accounts individually. This will be far too cumbersome and repetitive. However, given the way the Prosecution and Defence’s cases developed during the trial, the accounts also cannot be conveniently grouped around any single criterion. Certain accounts are most logically grouped around the TR or intermediary associated with them, and others are best grouped around their Relevant Accountholder. Further, the Defence’s best grouping of the accounts differed from the Prosecution’s.200 Accordingly, for clarity and to avoid as much repetition as possible, I adopt the following rules for grouping the 189 Relevant Accounts. (a) First, the 61 Relevant Accounts which had been under the management of the members of the Manhattan House Group – that was, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa – are dealt with separately from the remaining 128 Relevant Accounts. Given the extent to which the Defence’s case focused on these accounts as a group (see [129]–[130] above), it is appropriate for my analysis of the control of these 61 accounts to be set out independently from the others. (b) Second, the remaining 128 Relevant Accounts are separated into two main groups: (i) 102 Local Accounts; and (ii) 26 Foreign Accounts. These two groups are then further subdivided into the accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges and those which did not. This resulted in four groups: (i) Local Accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges (“Group 1”); (ii) Local Accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges (“Group 2”); (iii) Foreign Accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges (“Group 3”); and (iv) Foreign Accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges (“Group 4”). (c) Third, within these five groups, further sorting rules are applied. Group 1 comprises 83 Relevant Accounts and is further sub-grouped based on the TRs who managed those accounts. Within Group 2 there are 19 Relevant Accounts which are not further sub-grouped. Group 3, which comprises 20 Relevant Accounts, are further sub-grouped by the intermediary appointed to manage the accounts. Group 4 comprises six accounts and is further sub-grouped by their Relevant Accountholder. Lastly, my analysis of the 61 Relevant Accounts managed by the Manhattan House Group is organised around Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, though I will also address Mr Gwee’s role in the group.201 I will address Groups 1 to 4 followed by the Manhattan House Group.Group 1: Local Accounts; Deception Charges brought202 I will state my findings in respect of the 83 Relevant Accounts within this group alphabetically, based on the surnames of the TRs under whose care these Local Accounts were held.(1) Two accounts under Ms Ang 203 There were two Relevant Accounts held with UOB Kay Hian within Group 1 under the management Ms Ang,

 In summary, I found that these two accounts had in fact been controlled by the accused persons. I explain.204 Unfortunately, by the time the trial of this matter commenced in March 2019, Ms Ang had passed away. As such, the only direct evidence on which the Prosecution could rely, was that of Mr Chen.

 Mr Chen was one of the five witnesses in respect of whom the Defence had brought impeachment applications. (The others were Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa and Mr Lincoln Lee.) But as I will explain momentarily, I found Mr Chen to be a credible and forthright witness.205 By way of general background, Mr Chen was a Relevant Accountholder who had 14 Relevant Accounts in his name. These 14 accounts were held with eight FIs, both local and foreign. These were AmFraser, UOB Kay Hian, Lim & Tan, Phillip Securities, Maybank Kim Eng, DMG & Partners, Saxo and IB.

I recall that I first opened a trading account for [the First Accused’s (“JS”)] use after he had left Malaysia following the collapse of Omega Securities. After [the First Accused] became bankrupt, [Ms] Ung approached me and asked me to open trading accounts to hold JS’s shares. I agreed because given JS’s political and business influence in Malaysia at the time, I had hoped that doing him this favour would lead to JS providing me opportunities to elevate my standing in the corporate world and to engage me for legal work subsequently.Pursuant to the above, I first opened a cash trading account with [UOB Kay Hian] in May 2000. On JS’s direction, [Ms] Ung arranged for the [TR], [Ms] Ang and two other officers from UOB Kay Hian to come to Kuala Lumpur to meet me to complete the account opening form. … I appended my signature on the relevant parts of the form without reading it in detail, since I knew that the shares to be traded in the account did not belong to me. The UOB account bearing number 329019 was opened on or about 25 May 2000.…In December 2001, on [Ms] Ung’s request, I met [Ms] Ang to open a margin trading account with UOB Kay Hian to be used by JS. … I confirm that the signatures on the relevant parts of the form are mine. The UOB [Kay Hian] account bearing number 132837 was opened on or about 21 December 2001.207 In respect of the First Accused’s control and use of these two accounts, Mr Chen gave evidence as follows:

For the first five accounts opened between 2000 and 2002, the initial practice was for JS to convey his trading instructions to [Ms] Ung, for [Ms] Ung to tell me what the instructions are, and I would in turn relay those instructions to the brokers over the phone.After I had parted ways with [Ms] Ung in 2004 or 2005, JS then conveyed his trade instructions to me directly, either by phone or face-to-face, for me to then relay the instructions to the brokers over the phone. JS would specify the counter to buy or sell, the quantity and the price for the trade orders to be placed. He would also specify the brokerage firm or TR to place the trades through.I recall receiving statements from the CDP and/or the brokerage firms periodically, reflecting the trading activity and shares under my name. The brokers would either call or SMS me to report the trades executed in my accounts, and I would update JS accordingly.On some occasions, I received calls from [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] with trading instructions of a similar nature, to be relayed to the TRs. However, I did not convey the instructions to the TRs. I told JS that I was not comfortable receiving instructions from QSL and preferred to take instructions from JS only. He acknowledged this and stated that he would be the one to give me trading instructions. Thereafter, QSL stopped calling me to give me trading instructions.After 2011, I started receiving statements reflecting a significantly higher level of trading activity than the frequency with which I communicated with the TRs to relay JS’s trading instructions. I was shocked and asked JS about this, as I was concerned about the financial exposure in these accounts, given that the accounts were in my name.He told me not to worry, and that everything was under control. He assured me that he was responsible for the finances in these accounts, and that these accounts were just conducting discretionary trading. I asked him what ‘discretionary trading’ meant. He explained that the TRs were given discretion to trade on my behalf. As I was very busy in my role at LionGold at the time, I trusted JS’s reassurances to me, and accepted that there were trading activities being done in the accounts under my name on JS’s instructions, without my involvement.I have never placed any of my own trades in these accounts. I also did not give any of the TRs discretion to trade on my behalf.208 Mr Chen’s evidence, as reproduced above, cut right to the heart of the issue. Although I did not have Ms Ang’s evidence, Mr Chen’s evidence was nevertheless corroborated by the TRs of other local FIs. The evidence of those other TRs, namely, Mr Jordan Chew (see [256] below),

 Mr Ong KC (see [388] below), Mr Wong XY (see [444] below), and Mr Tjoa (see [716] below), strongly supported the conclusion that Mr Chen had not conducted any trading activity in any of the 14 Relevant Accounts, not just those under Ms Ang. In light of Mr Chen’s direct evidence that it was the First Accused who had been using his accounts, there was sufficient evidence to conclude the First Accused controlled them.209 The First Accused’s defence in respect of these two accounts held with UOB Kay Hian was, essentially, that Mr Chen’s then long-time girlfriend and, at some point, fiancée, Ms Ung, was the party actually using the accounts. In his submissions, the First Accused asserted that Mr Chen had “admitted that [Ms] Ung was actively involved in at least his account with [Ms] Ang, as he had authorised her to trade in his account, but it was evident that her involvement extended to all of his accounts”.

Question (Mr Sreenivasan): So do you agree that at this point in time, it became quite clear that at least on the account where Alice Ang was a TR, Ms Ung Hooi Leng was actively involved? Answer (Mr Chen): I don’t know whether she actually placed any orders on the -- on my behalf in the account, actually, even though she was authorised to do so. But yes, certainly, she drove me to the meeting with Alice and her girls at Shangri-La, and I believe she attended the meeting as well. But after -- thereafter, Alice Ang dealt quite closely with me.210 It was readily apparent from this that, even if Mr Chen could be understood as impliedly accepting the terms of Mr Sreenivasan’s question – that Ms Ung was “actively involved” in connection with Mr Chen’s account(s) under Ms Ang – the substance of his answer was, nevertheless, that he did not know whether Ms Ung actually placed any orders therein. However, as a starting point, I did not think Mr Chen’s answer could even be understood as accepting Ms Ung’s active involvement specifically in relation to the account(s) under consideration. 211 To establish that Ms Ung was the party controlling these two accounts held in Mr Chen’s name, the First Accused also alleged that Ms Ung and Ms Ang had been using Mr Chen’s accounts “since 2000” to engage in a long-running “malfeasance”.

Question (DPP Mr Teo): I’m trying to understand your evidence because, Mr Soh, here, we are talking about three different people, three ladies, two of whom are based in Singapore. That would be Ms Alice Ang and Ms Tracy Ooi. Then you have Ms Ung Hooi Leng, who is based in Malaysia, correct?Answer (the First Accused): Yes.Question (DPP Mr Teo): So how do they share a phone, a Malaysian phone number, this 6861 number? Do they pass the phone to each other, or what?Answer (the First Accused): Okay, your Honour, originally, it was used by Ms Ung in Malaysia. Then, as she progressively got hospitalised for long periods, it was then passed to Tracy and/or Alice to use. It was actually meant for Alice, until she began to spend quite some time in Australia. Now, I do not know the arrangement between the two in Singapore, but it is to my personal knowledge that they have, between them, many Malaysian phones, not just this one. Who and how they used, I am -- I am unable to tell, but the -- the brokers that they call is their old brokers’ network.212 For context, Ms Tracy Ooi

Answer (the First Accused): I disagree, and I should know because I’m the main intermediate -- main intermediary between Ms Ung and her other fellow TRs, Alice and Tracy.I don’t know whether it’s appropriate, your Honour, but my -- my -- my reading of why the other TRs say that is because I think they want to cover a 10-year-old malfeasance.Question (DPP Mr Teo): Sorry, 10-year-old malfeasance, meaning malfeasance by Ms Ung?Answer (the First Accused): Ms Ung -- Ms Ung, Alice and Tracy operating all these accounts for the last -- since the year 2000.Question (DPP Mr Teo): And, Mr Soh, you don’t really have a basis to say that other than your own say-so, correct? We haven’t seen any evidence of this Ms Ung, Ms Alice or Ms Tracy operating these accounts for the last -- well, since 2000?Answer (the First Accused): I think two things here, your Honour. One is both Joe Tiong and Andy Lee, after the crash, told me that they have been working with Alice since the early 2000s, and that Alice was always very, very domineering and very aggressive.Second thing is that I think -- I can’t remember, but I think it was on the stand when I heard Andy Lee saying that Alice is -- I can’t remember the word he used, but it’s very aggressive on a lot of trades and very possessive of Peter Chen’s accounts.Question (DPP Mr Teo): So now, Mr Soh, you are telling us that there was malfeasance, but you also told us that Ms Quah took over because Ms Ung became sick, right, to help out? So are you saying that Ms Quah took over and continued the malfeasance?Answer (the First Accused): No, Ms Quah took over just to pass the messages. I think, by then, if I remember the data, it had become a trickle of -- rather than what they were doing before.214 Respectfully, the First Accused’s response strained credulity, and, consequently, the Second Accused’s reliance on his evidence as a basis to introduce doubt in respect of her use of the 6861 number,

 also did not have a footing on which it could stand. 215 Before explaining why I did not believe the First Accused, however, it bears reiterating that in light of the Second Accused’s election not to give evidence, she could offer no positive explanation either of her own, or in support of the First Accused’s testimony.

 I did not accept this. It failed to account for the evidence of the numerous other TRs who testified that the Second Accused had contacted them using the 6861 number. As far as Mr Tai’s evidence was concerned, there was no dispute that the Second Accused had used more than one mobile line. In fact, Mr Tai’s evidence that the Second Accused had only started contacting him with the 6861 number in the latter half of 2013 was expressly prefaced by his statement that prior to that period, she had used the Singapore number 9650 6523.

 This was consistent with the evidence given by other TRs – for example, Mr Alex Chew (see [232] below), Mr Lincoln Lee (see [338(a)] below) and Mr Jack Ng (see [375] below). In respect of Mr Tiong’s evidence, for reasons I will set out at [428]–[443] below, I found his credit to have been impeached and did not give weight to his claim that the user of the 6861 number had been Ms Chong. In any case, that position was wholly inconsistent with the First Accused’s own evidence that the 6861 number’s other users had been Ms Ung, Ms Tracy Ooi and Ms Ang.216 I turn then to the First Accused’s position. As stated, I did not find it credible. On his evidence, not only would Ms Ung, Ms Tracy Ooi, Ms Ang and the Second Accused have had to share a mobile phone – an arrangement which, in and of itself seemed to defeat the very purpose a mobile phone served – I was urged to accept this conclusion on the rather thin basis that Ms Ung had been diagnosed with cancer and had therefore asked the Second Accused to assist her in relaying messages.

 This basis was particularly thin given that the Second Accused, Ms Ung, Ms Tracy Ooi and Ms Ang did not even reside in the same country. Further, there was evidence which showed that the roaming records of the 6861 number aligned with the Second Accused’s travel records.

 Also, I refer to my finding that the First Accused had tampered with Mr Gan’s evidence by directing him to inform the CAD that he could not be certain that the Second Accused had been the user of the 6861 number (see [1213]–[1225] below). In any event, apart from the difficulty I had understanding the logical premises of the First Accused’s explanation, the explanation still could not account for why Mr Chen gave direct, incriminating evidence against the accused persons as he did.217 In this connection, the First Accused suggested that Mr Chen was attempting to “downplay” Ms Ung’s role because his (present) wife was insecure about his past relationship with Ms Ung.

 I found this explanation to be rather farfetched, and it could not explain Mr Chen’s evidence that the First Accused had used all 14 Relevant Accounts he held with various FIs. If Mr Chen had indeed been concerned about calling his continued connection with Ms Ung to his wife’s attention, this did not explain why he stated unequivocally that the First Accused used the other 12 accounts. Nor did it account for the fact that the TRs in charge of those other accounts similarly testified to having received instructions from either the First Accused, the Second Accused or both. There was simply no reason proffered for why those other TRs might have acted uniformly against the accused persons in favour of Ms Ung.218 This then brings me to the First Accused’s impeachment application.

 omitted to mention that it was Ms Ung who had conveyed the First Accused’s request for Mr Chen to open the five Relevant Accounts he had held with UOB Kay Hian, Maybank Kim Eng, and Lim & Tan that had been opened between 2000 to 2002. Mr Chen had also omitted to inform the investigators that it was Ms Ung who had made arrangements for Mr Chen to complete the account opening forms. He mentioned her involvement only in his testimony. That was, in his conditioned statement (see [206] above). The First Accused submitted that these were material omissions as Ms Ung was the one actually in control of these accounts, not him, and Mr Chen had deliberately downplayed Ms Ung’s role so that the CAD would focus on the First Accused’s involvement in the opening of these accounts. (b) I did not accept that these were material omissions. In my view, Mr Chen’s consistent position was that the First Accused had requested the opening of those accounts and, more pertinently, that it was the First Accused who had controlled them. In particular, in the investigation statement dated 19 August 2014, Mr Chen stated that he opened the ten accounts pursuant to the First Accused’s requests, but acknowledged that there was the possibility that the First Accused could have asked someone to convey the requests to him.

 What was not stated in Mr Chen’s investigative statements was the fact that Ms Ung had conveyed the First Accused’s instructions to open those accounts, and that she had played a role in arranging the opening of those accounts. This, however, in my view, was not a material inconsistency. (c) Mr Chen’s explanation that he had forgotten Ms Ung was involved

 was plausible. Given that the account openings took place, at that point, around 12 or 13 years prior to Mr Chen’s interviews, this could hardly be said to be a significant omission. Furthermore, even if I scrutinise the omission with ample suspicion, Mr Chen also made the clear and simple point that there was no reason to downplay Ms Ung’s involvement.

 While, as mentioned at [217] above, the First Accused had suggested that Mr Chen was seeking to conceal his connection to Ms Ung from his wife, there was no suggestion that there was anything untoward about Mr Chen’s interactions with Ms Ung, much less that their interactions were of such a character that warranted Mr Chen deceiving the investigating authorities. (d) Furthermore, while Mr Chen may have omitted to mention Ms Ung’s involvement in the opening of some of these accounts, including Mr Chen’s two accounts under Ms Ang, the fact of Ms Ung’s involvement in the opening of those accounts may or may not have revealed any involvement in the use of those accounts. If Mr Chen had indeed intended to downplay Ms Ung’s role, his omission was a relatively toothless way to accomplish that objective.220 Related to the above, the second inconsistency concerned Mr Chen’s shift in position regarding when he broke up with Ms Ung, and the period in which she was involved in the opening of accounts.

 However, in his testimony, Mr Chen said that he had broken up with Ms Ung in 2004 or 2005, and that she was no longer involved in the opening of accounts thereafter.

(b) While this inconsistency seemed to bolster the First Accused’s claim that Mr Chen was “downplaying” Ms Ung’s role, my view was that it was quite a peripheral matter. Mr Chen’s consistent position was that all requests for accounts to be opened stemmed from the First Accused, and not Ms Ung. Although, as discussed above, he omitted to mention her in his investigation statements dated 8 April 2014 and 19 August 2014, he was thereafter generally candid about Ms Ung’s involvement in the opening of accounts. In his investigation statement dated 7 April 2015, he stated, “[f]or all the securities trading accounts which were opened in 2010 and before, they were opened upon [Ms] Ung’s request and she claimed it was upon [the First Accused’s] request”.

(c) Having admitted to Ms Ung’s role in the opening process for at least some accounts, there was no reason for Mr Chen to then attempt to conceal that role in respect of two specific accounts opened in 2010 in his testimony. Indeed, of Mr Chen’s 14 accounts, five were opened between 2000 and 2002, two in 2010, two in 2012, and five in 2013. This being the case, assuming that Mr Chen was attempting to back-pedal when he changed his position that they broke up between 2008 and 2010 to sometime in 2004 or 2005, that did nothing to distance Ms Ung from the opening of the accounts between 2000 and 2002. It made little sense that Mr Chen lied to minimise her involvement in the opening of two accounts, but not the others. Put another way, this change in position had so little bearing on how Mr Chen’s evidence framed either the First Accused or Ms Ung’s role, that it was difficult to read into it a more fundamental issue with Mr Chen’s credibility. I therefore did not find that these aspects were material.221 Third, the First Accused contended that Mr Chen was inconsistent in his evidence relating to whether it was he, ie, the First Accused, who financed the use of certain Relevant Accounts, or, whether it was the accountholders who had provided such financing.

 All the cash and collateral in the trading accounts were arranged for by [the First Accused]. The share proceeds in the accounts were also applied according to [the First Accused’s] instructions. I was never informed by the TRs or [the First Accused] about the amount of profits in my trading accounts. From time to time, [the First Accused] informed me that cash withdrawals would be made from my trading accounts. This was to prepare me for the calls I would subsequently receive from the brokerage to confirm that these cash withdrawals are to be executed. I would duly confirm the withdrawals with the brokerages as per [the First Accused’s] instructions, and the monies would be credited to bank accounts in my name, either directly or via cheque. These monies were then applied by [the First Accused] towards other purposes unknown to me, because the relevant bank accounts were also opened in my name for [the First Accused’s] use. I will elaborate on this below.(b) Mr Chen subsequently explained in court that the position he had taken in his 20 August 2014 statement was false, and that he had lied to the CAD.

 I was satisfied with this explanation. In court, Mr Chen stated that the true position was that, although the First Accused did have financial backers, such funding had not been applied to his 14 Relevant Accounts. He had lied to downplay the First Accused’s role in the use of these accounts and to create doubt as to whether the First Accused had been their beneficial owner. As regards why Mr Chen did so, he explained that the First Accused had instructed him to take steps to distance the First Accused from the trading activity in his accounts. As an implied threat, the First Accused stated that he had a mole within the CAD who would notify him of the information given by interviewees.

 This alleged threat itself formed the subject of a Witness Tampering Charge against the First Accused, and my decision in respect of that charge (see [1197] below) led me to the conclusion that Mr Chen’s shift from the evidence given in his 20 August 2014 statement, to his evidence in court, was not a shift which undermined his credibility.(c) In any event, even if I did not accept Mr Chen’s explanation, I would not have found Mr Chen’s failure to raise the First Accused’s alleged financiers in his testimony in court to be an inconsistency which cast doubt on his credibility as a witness. Whether or not the First Accused had financiers to back the trading activity conducted in Mr Chen’s 14 Relevant Accounts did not materially impact the essence of the Prosecution’s case – that it was the accused persons who had controlled the use of the accounts. Of course, it would have been useful to have information regarding the source of wealth. However, in my view, that was at most background information. The disclosure of such information would have helped paint a fuller picture of the inner workings of the First Accused’s alleged involvement in the use of these accounts, but Mr Chen’s subsequent failure to present such information did not undermine the crucial point of his evidence – that it was the First Accused who had operated his accounts. It was entirely reasonable for Mr Chen to say that the First Accused was the operator of his accounts without disclosing that there were financial backers who supported such activities. This conclusion was particularly sensible because it was not even the First Accused’s defence that those financiers had anything to do with the operation of Mr Chen’s accounts.222 Fourth, the First Accused submitted that there was a material inconsistency in Mr Chen’s evidence as regards whether he had authorised the relevant TRs to place trades in his accounts.

 Mr Chen stated that he had authorised the TRs, including Ms Ang, to place trades in his accounts, at their discretion. However, in court, his evidence was that, from 2011, he started receiving statements which reflected a higher volume of trading activity, and at a higher frequency than he had been relaying the First Accused’s instructions to the TRs. He then asked the First Accused to explain why this was the case. The First Accused assured him that there was nothing to worry about, and that the TRs were authorised to trade at their discretion (see evidence reproduced at [207] above).

 It was not believable, the First Accused argued, for Mr Chen to say on one hand that he was attempting to shield the First Accused here, yet, on the other, not to have been doing so consistently in respect of other statements he had given to the CAD. (c) I was of the view that the two positions were not necessarily inconsistent. Mr Chen had revealed to the CAD that he was holding his trading accounts for the First Accused’s benefit, and it appeared that he had to because he simply could not explain the activity in his accounts. Indeed, on any account, Mr Chen’s clear and consistent position was that he himself had not used the accounts. Even so, this did not mean that he could not still downplay the First Accused’s involvement by pushing the responsibility for the orders and trades to the TRs. It was one thing to be the real owner of an account, it was another to be its owner and operator. Indeed, distancing the First Accused from the operation of the accounts was significant. Had this explanation been accepted by the CAD, they would have concluded that Mr Chen and the First Accused were guilty of some nominee trading, but that the relevant TRs were the ones who perpetuated the substantial trading activity actually seen in the accounts. I therefore accepted Mr Chen’s explanation as to the inconsistency between his investigation statements and his account in court.223 Fifth, the First Accused submitted that Mr Chen was inconsistent in his evidence in respect of why he had subscribed to two key telephone lines ostensibly used by the accused persons – the 3611 and the 6861 numbers.

I checked with Ung Hooi Leng’s parents. In 2009/2010 when I broke up with [Ms Ung], I did request for her to terminate both these lines as we are no longer an item. …Question 582: Can you help to refresh the reason for your to register these two numbers … under your name for [Ms] Ung?Answer: I believe one line was registered for her personal use and another according to her was for her ‘politics’ use. I cannot remember exactly when the lines were registered, perhaps circa 2000.…Question 1332: I refer you to … This series of exhibits feature billing records for a Celcom mobile phone number +6019-7726861 from August 2012 to November 2013. Registered under “Mr Peter Chen Hing Woon”. Did you subscribe to this number?Answer: I don’t remember subscribing to this. It could be my ex-fiancée who subscribed to this. It was not me as far as I can remember.Question 1335: Who received the bill for this mobile phone number?Answer: I don’t recall seeing this, I’m not sure who would have received it. Probably [Ms] Ung should have made her arrangements.(b) However, in court, Mr Chen testified that both numbers had been subscribed for the First Accused’s use, and no mention was made of Ms Ung’s role not only in the subscription of these numbers, but their apparent use by her.

  Prosecution’s Impeachment Submissions (21 Sep 2020) (Mr Chen) at para 32.



 I agreed with this. The important question was the consistency and materiality of Mr Chen’s evidence in respect of the user of these two numbers. I am mindful that Mr Chen’s position had also changed in respect of who used these mobile phone numbers. However, I did not think that this affected his credibility when the context behind his evidence was considered. Indeed, the fact that Mr Chen had raised Ms Ung in his 1 December 2014 statement seemed to me to undermine the First Accused’s general submission that Mr Chen was not a credible witness because, amongst other things, the evidence he gave served to protect Ms Ung and implicate the First Accused. Contrary to this, Mr Chen’s answers in the statements set out above showed that he was quite willing to involve Ms Ung as the user of a crucial number that had been used to instruct many TRs. I therefore did not find that Mr Chen’s credibility was affected by this inconsistency, and I accepted the evidence he gave in court that the numbers had been used by the First Accused.224 The final inconsistency concerned Mr Tai’s creation and use of a fake email account in Mr Chen’s name to open trading accounts with IB.(a) In Mr Chen’s investigation statement of 7 April 2015, he stated that he had been informed by Mr Tai that the latter had used a fictitious email account, “peterchenhw@hotmail.com”, on the First Accused’s instructions, when opening the former’s IB account.

 who explained that the defence they were going to run was that Mr Tai had entered into a commission generating scheme with Mr Swanson. Pursuant to this, they would allege that Mr Tai used fake email accounts which the accountholders did not authorise, and in so doing, Mr Tai could conduct trades in their accounts without them receiving any notice thereof. Correspondingly, the First Accused would then arrange for Mr Tai to file an affidavit confirming these allegations.

 and said that they had been trying to reach him at an email address, presumably “peterchenhw@hotmail.com”. It was pointed out to him that, in his 7 April 2015 statement, he had said that the email address had been submitted with his account opening form,

 suggesting that Mr Chen did not only learn about the fake email address after the Crash. Mr Chen then explained that he could have come to the conclusion that the email address had been included in his account opening form when Dato Kumar showed them some documents, though he stated that he could not remember if he “sighted the account opening”. He was not specifically questioned on his answer in the 7 April 2015 statement that Mr Tai had used the fake email account on the First Accused’s instructions.

 (c) There was little which I could make of this apparent inconsistency. Although Mr Chen’s explanation left a few gaps, the accounts of how the fake email address came into play were not inherently contradictory. Based on Mr Chen’s 7 April 2015 statement, at the stage of his IB account being opened, Mr Tai had used a false email address on the First Accused’s instructions. Whether it was true that Mr Tai was instructed by the First Accused to do so, there was nothing contradictory in Mr Chen saying that he only discovered the usage of the false email address subsequently, after the Crash when contacted by IB. Nothing about Mr Chen’s description of the meeting between the IB accountholders and Dato Kumar sat uncomfortably with the account given in his statement. The points which were not resolved were how and when Mr Tai had informed Mr Chen that he had used the fake email account to open Mr Chen’s account, and whether the First Accused had instructed that this be done. Unfortunately, Mr Chen was not specifically questioned on this, and so there was nothing I could make of the gaps. 225 In line with the reasons above, I agreed with the Prosecution that most of the discrepancies between Mr Chen’s statements and his testimony were not significant. It was only the fourth area which I regard as giving rise to a material inconsistency, and in respect of this, Mr Chen satisfactorily explained the discrepancies between his two accounts. I thus found no basis to impeach his credit. To the contrary, I found him generally to be a forthcoming and creditworthy witness. It was on this basis that I accepted Mr Chen’s evidence that his two accounts under Ms Ang held with UOB Kay Kian had been controlled and used by the First Accused.226 Indeed, it was apparent to me, on a more general basis, that these two Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the First Accused in connection with a larger scheme. This was evident from: (a) the substantial number of accounts which Mr Chen testified had been for the First Accused’s use – a total of 14 including these two; (b) the fact that several of these accounts had been monitored in the Shareholding Schedule (see [744] below); (c) Mr Chen’s evidence regarding the assistance he had rendered to the First Accused with share transfers and assignments;

 and (d) the use of BAL shares as collateral to obtain funding in some of Mr Chen’s accounts.227 That said, despite these findings, I should state that there were some issues with the GovTech Evidence in respect of these two accounts. Contrary to the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had both instructed Ms Ang directly, the data showed no proximate communications between the accused persons and Ms Ang.

 Naturally, the question to which this gave rise was whether this ought to have affected my acceptance of Mr Chen’s evidence. Slightly unfortunately, the Prosecution’s submissions treated Mr Chen’s 14 Relevant Accounts as a unit,

 and so, they only pointed to the accounts within this group of 14 which reflected a high percentage of trades preceded by communications between the accused persons and the relevant TR.

 The absence of any communication between the accused persons and Ms Ang was conspicuously left unaddressed. The Defence’s submissions also curiously did not raise this point, which was patently one in their favour. 228 In any case, I did not find that the GovTech Evidence meaningfully contradicted Mr Chen’s account. The Authorised Persons’ Analysis conducted by Ms Gao also showed that there had not been any proximate communications between Mr Chen and Ms Ang in respect of trades placed in both his accounts with OCBC Securities. Thus, this was not an instance where the evidence flatly flew in the face of the primary evidence; it simply had no probative value one way or the other. Moreover, without Ms Ang’s evidence, it could not be known how else she might have been contactable, or whether there might be another explanation which could have accounted for this gap. For example, there were other TRs and intermediaries who sought to explain a lack or low rate of trades preceded by calls from the accused persons, by reference to the use of Blackberry messages and burner phones. Given the weak character of the contradiction, and the uncertainty surrounding how this contradiction arose, I did not find that it affected the veracity of Mr Chen’s evidence, which I reiterate that I accepted.(2) Eight accounts under Mr Alex Chew 229 The next subgroup of Relevant Accounts included those held with DMG & Partners under the management of the TR Mr Alex Chew.

231 As a starting point, Mr Alex Chew’s evidence was that he was not the TR with whom these eight Relevant Accounts had been opened. Instead, he had taken over these eight accounts from Mr Tai – previously, a TR with DMG & Partners – in October 2011, when Mr Tai had left the FI.

 232 More pertinently, it was Mr Tai’s evidence that he had informed Mr Alex Chew that the trading instructions in respect of these eight accounts would be given by the Second Accused. Mr Tai claimed to have omitted mentioning the First Accused because he “had a bad reputation in the market and [Mr Tai] did not want to alarm [Mr Alex Chew]”.

It is useful for the relevant portions of Mr Alex Chew’s evidence to be set out in full:

During the time when I was the trading representative for these eight accounts, nearly all the trades that I carried out were instructed by [the Second Accused (“Su-Ling”)] and [the First Accused (“John”)], rather than the clients themselves. The clients told me to take trading instructions from Su-Ling and John, and execute trades in their accounts.How I came to take trading instructions from Su-LingThe eight trading accounts were transferred to me in October 2011 Sometime in that month, I called the four clients to introduce myself to them. During these calls, each of them told me that I could take trading instructions from Su-Ling for trades in their accounts – this is except for [Ms Huang (“HPM”)], as it is possible that it was her husband [Mr Goh HC] who told me that I could take trading instructions from Su-Ling not only in his own accounts, but in HPM’s accounts as well. The clients also informed me that Su-Ling would settle losses arising from the trades in their accounts.The clients might have given me Su-Ling’s phone number. … She communicated trading instructions to me (on my mobile number 9780 2127) via calls, messages, WhatsApp, or on my Blackberry via Blackberry messages (my Blackberry number is 9615 7781), using the phone numbers 9650 6523 and 60 19772 6861. She would contact me at least once a week, and sometimes several times a week, to place orders in the accounts of my four clients.All my communications with Su-Ling were in respect of trades in the accounts of the four clients. I have never given her any trading advice. How I came to take trading instructions from JohnSubsequently, I started receiving trading instructions from John as well. This started around the time the clients’ accounts started trading the shares of Blumont Group Ltd (“Blumont”). The earliest Blumont trade in the clients’ accounts took place on 27 December 2012. From what I recall, the clients did inform me that I could also take trading instructions from John and execute trades in their accounts as well. It is possible that Su-Ling also told me that I could take instructions from John.It was either the clients or Su-Ling who gave me John’s phone number. … He communicated trading instructions to me (on my mobile number 97802127 or 87003908) via calls, or on my Blackberry via Blackberry messages (my Blackberry number is 96157781), using the phone number 60123123611. He would contact me at least once a week to place orders in the accounts of my four clients.All my communications with John were in respect of trades in the accounts of the four clients. I have never given him any trading advice.233 Mr Alex Chew confirmed this evidence under cross-examination. Most saliently, he stated the following:

Question (Mr Sreenivasan): Okay. Now, at the time he handed over the clients to you, did [Mr Tai] tell you anything about how trading instructions were given in relation to these four accounts?Answer (Mr Alex Chew): No.…Question (Mr Sreenivasan): Now, you just said that [Mr] Tai did not tell you what the trading pattern or trading instructions would be. So if you now read paragraph 4 [of your conditioned statement], you can see the last two lines: “The clients told me to take trading instructions from Su-Ling and John and execute trades in their accounts.” Do you see that?Answer (Mr Alex Chew): Yes.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): So these instructions were given, according to you, by the four clients as a matter of fact? They just said, “Alex, there is this person called Su-Ling, there is this person called John, they will give you instructions for our accounts”; is that correct?Answer (Mr Alex Chew): Yes.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): They gave you these instructions verbally?Answer (Mr Alex Chew): Yes, verbal.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): No email, according to you?Answer (Mr Alex Chew): No.… 234 During the cross-examination of Mr Tai, he was asked about this difference between his and Mr Alex Chew’s evidence. The point that the Defence sought to make – by pursuing questions in this connection – was that Mr Tai had asked Mr Alex Chew to “cover up” his involvement in respect of how the Second Accused came to give trading instructions for these accounts. However, when this was put to Mr Tai, he denied doing so.

 235 I did not think the Defence’s point was effective. As far as Mr Tai was concerned, it was illogical that he would, on one hand, ask Mr Alex Chew to leave his name aside, while admitting in his own evidence that he had been the one who told Mr Alex Chew that the Second Accused would be giving trading instructions for those eight accounts. In respect of Mr Alex Chew, even if I had assumed that he was driven wholly by self-preservation, purposely omitting to mention Mr Tai did nothing to advance his position. After all, irrespective of who had told Mr Alex Chew that he could receive instructions from the Second Accused, he was still admitting to taking instructions from her without proper written authorisation. It thus appeared that this could be chalked up to a largely immaterial difference in recollection. Notwithstanding such difference, the ultimate point was that, on both Mr Alex Chew and Mr Tai’s evidence, it was the Second Accused and, thereafter, also the First Accused, who had given instructions on these accounts. The real question was simply whether this evidence ought to be believed.236 In greater detail, Mr Alex Chew gave evidence that he regularly took trading instructions from the accused persons via calls, BlackBerry messages, as well as other forms of text messages. An example of BlackBerry messages exchanged between the First Accused and Mr Alex Chew was set out at [110] above. Mr Alex Chew was also detailed in his account of how the accused persons instructed him. For example, he testified that they generally allowed him to use any of the eight accounts which had available trading limits, though they would sometimes specify the account which they wished for him to use.

 Furthermore, he also stated that the Second Accused would sometimes instruct him to split larger bids to avoid giving the impression that there was a substantial buyer in the market.

237 The accused persons’ free and general control of these eight accounts was also supported by objective evidence. I will cite a few examples. First, on 23 October 2011 – around the time Mr Tai had transferred the management of these accounts to Mr Alex Chew – the Second Accused sent an email to the First Accused (in which Mr Goh HC was copied) with a list of contact details of TRs and accountholders. In it, Mr Alex Chew was described as “ken t replacement”.

 This was revealing. Mr Tai’s evidence – which I found to be generally credible (cross-reference [688]–[694] below) – was that he had: (a) taken instructions both from the First and Second Accused whilst he was a TR in DMG & Partners; (b) that they had instructed him to avoid wash trades; and (c) that they had paid for the contra losses incurred in the accounts.

 The fact that Mr Alex Chew was described by the Second Accused as Mr Tai’s “replacement” suggested that his role was similar to that played by Mr Tai before he left.238 Second, another incident I found particularly revealing was one on 27 December 2012 where Mr Hong’s account had been used to purchase Blumont shares. Although this trade did not fall within the period with which the Blumont False Trading Charges were concerned (see [157] above), it took place only shortly before the start of that period and, further, was highly probative as to the fact of the accused persons’ general control. On this occasion, one of Mr Hong’s two accounts with DMG & Partners was used to purchase 800,000 Blumont shares. Mr Hong was not aware that this trade had been carried out, a fact which he confirmed on the stand.

 This was notable because, as an Executive Director of Blumont, this purchase triggered a disclosure obligation on Mr Hong’s part. The First Accused did not respond to Mr Hong and, so, he proceeded to contact Mr Alex Chew, who informed him about the trade.

 The fact that Mr Hong lacked control of his own account, strongly suggested the extent to which the accused persons had control over these accounts. 239 Third, apart from the messages dated 13 April 2013 reproduced at [110] above, there were several others which also strongly supported the conclusion that the accused persons had been controlling these eight Relevant Accounts. One example is worth considering in detail. On 10 May 2013 at 12.32pm, Mr Alex Chew sent the following message to the First Accused: “Good morning John. We have 350 LG at average of S$1.145 under Mr Goh HC and Mr James due today. Thanks”.

 Thus, the First Accused highlighted that he had not even replied Mr Alex Chew on this occasion, which supported his point that it was only on a “best-endeavour” basis. If he had been giving trading instructions, time would have been of the essence, and he would not have ignored Mr Alex Chew. The First Accused’s evidence, that he was merely giving “advice” on behalf of accountholders to the TRs, was corroborated by Mr Hong. Mr Hong similarly testified that the First Accused had not given trading instructions in his account, and that his involvement was limited to giving advice.

241 This, however, was not believable. If the First Accused had been “giving advice”, it was very odd for Mr Alex Chew to seek the First Accused’s “advice” by aggregating the volume and averaging the price of the LionGold shares due in accounts held by two different accountholders.

 This strongly undercut the First Accused’s position that he was only giving advice. Further, although Mr Hong’s evidence stood in support of the First Accused, their evidence was contradicted by Mr Goh HC’s unequivocal evidence that the shares which had been traded in his and Ms Huang’s account did not belong to them,

 242 Taken together, the points already rendered the First Accused’s explanation implausible. However, in my view, there was an even more pertinent fact which contradicted his explanation. This was the fact that – earlier on 10 May 2013, at 9.56am – Mr Alex Chew had sent the exact same message to the Second Accused,

 who also did not reply. There was nothing to suggest that the Second Accused, like the First Accused, had been trusted by any of the Relevant Accountholders to give “advice” to the TRs. As she elected not to give evidence, the Second Accused was also unable to explain the fact of this message. Without any explanation from the Second Accused, the fact that Mr Alex Chew had sent this message first to the Second Accused, and later, to the First Accused, suggested strongly that he was simply seeking instructions from either accused person rather than “advice” from the First Accused. If he had actually been seeking the First Accused’s advice pursuant to some standing arrangement between the First Accused and the Relevant Accountholders, there was no logical reason for Mr Alex Chew to contact the Second Accused first as he did.243 I turn then to the other responses raised by the Defence in respect of these eight Relevant Accounts. The Second Accused did not make submissions to specifically refute the Prosecution’s case that she had exercised control over the Relevant Accounts under Mr Alex Chew.

 In the circumstances – and, given that the accused persons had not run cut-throat defences, but rather took positions generally consistent with each other’s interests – I took the First Accused’s evidence and submissions as representing the Defence’s overall case. In this regard, the First Accused’s other arguments followed four broad steps.244 First, the GovTech Evidence showed a generally low rate of proximate communication between the accused persons and Mr Alex Chew.

 The general import of the Defence’s submission was that there were numerous days during the Relevant Period where trades were placed in these eight accounts, without any proximate communications, ie, Clear Days (see [117] above).246 Second, the dearth of objective evidence demonstrating the fact of the accused persons’ instructions severely undercut the Prosecution’s case because Mr Alex Chew was, additionally, an untrustworthy witness. The Defence made three points in support of this submission.

Indeed, when confronted with the fact that he had been seen discussing his evidence with those two ex-colleagues, Mr Alex Chew hesitated substantially before he came clean.

[T]he practice of entering relatively large orders on one side of an exchange’s … electronic order book … without a genuine intention that the orders will be executed: the orders are placed at prices which are (so the person placing them believes) unlikely to attract counterparties, while they nevertheless achieve his objective of moving the price of the relevant share as the market adjusts to the fact that there has been an apparent shift in the balance of supply and demand. The movement is then followed by the execution of a trade on the opposite side of the order book which takes advantage of, and profits from, that movement. This trade is in turn followed by a rapid deletion of the large orders which had been entered for the purpose of causing the movement in price, and by repetition of the behaviour in reverse on the other side of the order book. In other words, a person engaged in layering attempts to move the price up in order to benefit from a sale at a high price, then attempts to move it down in order to buy again, but at a lower price, and typically repeats the process several times.247 Third, even if the court were to ignore the apparent gaps in the BlackBerry messages and examine the messages which were adduced in evidence, those messages did not support the conclusion that the First Accused had instructed Mr Alex Chew to place trades in the eight Relevant Accounts under his management as a TR. This could be gathered from the fact that:

 Had the First Accused been giving trading instructions to Mr Alex Chew by BlackBerry messages, such facts would not have been observed. Thus, the First Accused’s account – that he was merely giving advice to Mr Alex Chew on behalf of the Relevant Accountholders – was more consistent with the objective facts.

248 Lastly, in any event, even if the First Accused’s BlackBerry exchanges were to be construed as trading instructions, they only accounted for a total of 26 transactions. This could not support the conclusion that the First Accused – much less both the First and Second Accused – had been controlling the eight accounts managed by Mr Alex Chew. Indeed, there was no other objective evidence demonstrating that the accused persons had communicated BAL trading instructions to Mr Alex Chew.

249 I was very conscious of the Defence’s first argument, which was namely, the disparity between Mr Alex Chew’s account and the generally low rate of communications between the accused persons and Mr Alex Chew proximate to BAL trades being entered in these eight Relevant Accounts in the GovTech Evidence (see [115]–[120] above). However, as mentioned at [244]–[245] above, Mr Alex Chew’s evidence was that he had chiefly communicated with the accused persons via BlackBerry messaging. Such messages did not form part of the telecommunications records used by Ms Gao in preparing the GovTech Evidence,

 and, thus, it was not axiomatic that the low rate of proximate trade orders meant that the accused persons had not in fact given trading instructions to Mr Alex Chew.250 Of course, I was also mindful of the Defence’s argument that there was equally no record of BlackBerry messages being exchanged between the Second Accused and Mr Alex Chew, and only a limited 109 messages which had been exchanged with the First Accused. As stated at [245] above, the Defence pressed the conclusion that there was no good reason for such a “gap” to exist in the data which could be extracted from the accused persons’ BlackBerry devices, and, thus, the proper inference to be drawn was that such messages did not exist. As a corollary, accepting this argument would have been to conclude that Mr Alex Chew was lying about having received “most” of the trading instructions in respect of these eight Relevant Accounts from the accused persons via BlackBerry messages.251 I did not, however, agree that such a conclusion followed from the lack of BlackBerry messages between the Second Accused and Mr Alex Chew, as well as the seemingly incomplete record of BlackBerry messages between him and the First Accused. Such a conclusion required me to ignore the other revealing strands of evidence which contradicted the Defence’s case, such as the three mentioned at [237]–[242] above. Indeed, there were two other indicia that strongly supported the conclusion that both accused persons had controlled these eight Relevant Accounts. First, Mr Alex Chew also testified that – when losses had been suffered in the accounts – the Second Accused would arrange for Mr Jumaat

 If the accused persons had not been in control of these eight accounts, it was inexplicable that the Second Accused was making such payment arrangements. 252 Second, of the 109 BlackBerry messages exchanged between the First Accused and Mr Alex Chew that were adduced as evidence, the way they flowed suggested that certain messages were in fact missing. Take, for example, the following exchange on 15 May 2013:

 253 All the available messages on 15 May 2013 have been reproduced and none have been omitted. The message sent by Mr Alex Chew at 1.08pm, thus, was telling. It was plain from this message that there must have been some sort of communication between him and the First Accused after 9.50am and before 1.08pm which prompted that message to be sent. It was not clear whether such communication was also via BlackBerry messaging or by some other means or platform, but, the inescapable point was that there must have been some other communication. This, accordingly, favoured the Prosecution’s submission that there were BlackBerry messages which could not have been extracted. It sharply undercut the Defence’s suggestion that the 109 messages adduced represented the entire universe of messages exchanged between the two.254 In the round, based on my analysis of all the foregoing evidence as well as arguments, I was satisfied that the accused persons had been in control of these eight Relevant Accounts held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Alex Chew. In arriving at this conclusion, I was mindful of the following. (a) First, while I thought that there was a contradiction between the GovTech Evidence and Mr Alex Chew’s account, I ultimately saw that as a weak contradiction which did not undermine the veracity of the primary evidence given by Mr Alex Chew, Mr Tai and Mr Goh HC, supported by other pieces of objective evidence, most particularly, the actual words used by the First Accused in his BlackBerry messages to Mr Alex Chew.

 (b) Second, although I was not satisfied with the manner in which Mr Alex Chew conducted himself as a witness (see [246(b)] above), I did not think this rose to the level of affecting his general credibility. I also firmly rejected the Second Accused’s allegation that the Prosecution had coached him as a witness – this was wholly baseless and did not merit serious consideration (also see [1480] below).(c) Third, the totality of evidence adduced specifically against the Second Accused certainly called for her to provide an explanation. After all, Mr Alex Chew made direct allegations against her and, as I stated, his account was adequately supported by objective evidence (in particular, see [242] above). Without her evidence in response, the testimony given by Mr Alex Chew as against her specifically was essentially left unchallenged.(d) Finally, though Mr Hong’s evidence stood in support of the Defence, as I will explain from [385]–[387] below, the Prosecution applied to impeach him, and I found that his credibility was affected. The testimony he gave generally in favour of the accused persons was, accordingly, insufficient to cast reasonable doubt on the weighty opposing evidence adduced by the Prosecution.255 I thus found that the accused persons had controlled the eight Relevant Accounts held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Alex Chew. Additionally, given the substantial volume of BAL trades executed in these accounts,

How I came to take trading instructions from [the Second Accused (“QSL”)]From the list of clients which Yap handed over to me, Yap pointed out to me who her key clients were. Key clients means the clients who had a high net worth, and/or who traded more actively e.g. every week. From these key clients, she drew my attention to four clients in particular – QSL, [Mr Chen], [Mr Menon] and [Mr Neo]. She told me that these four clients were a group of investors, and that I only needed to liaise with QSL in order to take instructions for the accounts of the other clients in the group.…Around the time when Yap was leaving DMG, she introduced me to QSL over dinner. After all of Yap’s clients were transferred to me, QSL started giving me instructions for the above accounts. Since Yap had told me that QSL would be giving trading instructions for these clients’ accounts, I proceeded to take instructions from QSL for these five accounts.As it is my practice to make an effort to get to know my clients, after the accounts were transferred to me, I called [Mr Chen], [Mr Menon] and [Mr Neo] to inform them that I was taking over their accounts from Yap. During those initial calls, it was discussed that I would continue with the existing arrangement of taking instructions, that is, to take trading instructions for each of their accounts from QSL.One of my colleagues in my team, [Ms Jeanne Ong], helped to handle my clients’ accounts, including these five accounts, when I was away on leave. I told [Ms Jeanne Ong] that QSL could give instructions for these five accounts. [Ms Jeanne Ong] would have directly received instructions from QSL for these accounts …It was only sometime in the second half of 2012 that I realised that DMG required clients who wanted to appoint other persons to give trading instructions in their account to fill in a Third Party Authorisation to Trade Form (“Third Party Authorisation Form”). This Third Party Authorisation Form needed to be completed even in cases where a client’s close relative wanted to give trading instructions in the client’s account, for example, in the case of a son giving instructions for his mother’s account, or a husband giving instructions for his wife’s account.Once I realised that such Third Party Authorisation Forms existed and needed to be completed by the clients, I contacted [Mr Chen], [Mr Menon] and [Mr Neo] to ask them to sign the Third Party Authorisation Form to authorise QSL to trade. I told each of them that they needed to sign this Third Party Authorisation Form in order for me to continue taking trading instructions from QSL in their accounts. I also gave the Third Party Authorisation Form to each of them via email or in hardcopy when I met them.Each of the above-mentioned clients separately promised to complete and sign the Third Party Authorisation Form, and assured me that it was fine for me to continue with the arrangement of QSL giving trading instructions for their accounts. They each told me that QSL was just managing their accounts for them. However, I did not ultimately receive the signed Third Party Authorisation Forms from any of the clients. I continued to take trading instructions from QSL whilst I was waiting for the signed Third Party Authorisation Forms to be passed to me because the clients had already said it was fine to continue the arrangement. However, I would update them after QSL had placed trades in their accounts.259 Apart from his positive testimony that the Second Accused had given trading instructions in respect of the three accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Menon and Mr Neo, Mr Jordan Chew also attested that other than the Second Accused, none of the three accountholders “[had] ever given [him] trading instructions for their respective trading accounts”. He specifically stated that he recalled only ever receiving trading instructions in respect of these accounts from the Second Accused.

Can you put your hand on your heart, Mr Chew, and tell me you are really able to be certain that in these three accounts where you got calls as part of your normal daily trading activities, you can be certain that the account holders never called you? Sorry, never gave instructions for trades.Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): I can’t.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): You can’t be certain, right?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): (Witness nods).Question (Mr Sreenivasan): Of course, because you can’t remember, and trades are things you don’t keep in your head, because you take it, you execute, and you clear your mind. Right?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): Yes.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): But why do you come and say, “I’m certain”? Was it your words?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): That is because the mem -- my memory during the period, right, that was the impression I remember at that point.…Question (Mr Sreenivasan): I will let the DPP re-examine you on your certainty. Because you see, can you look at paragraph 21 [of your conditioned statement] on the seven phone calls from the Malaysian number, and here you say: “I cannot recall specifically, but it is possible that QSL was giving me trading instructions using someone else’s phone.” So at least for these seven calls, it’s quite obvious you were not certain. But then we come to paragraph 25. You make this statement of “certain”. Do you agree that your paragraph 21 and your paragraph 25 are not consistent with each other?…Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): No, depending on the context.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): Tell me, how … are they consistent with each other?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): On paragraph 25, when I said “certain”, right, the impression and what I remember during that period of time, most of the order cames [sic] from Quah.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): No, no, no, hold on, hold on … So there are only two possibilities: only QSL and QSL or somebody else besides the three clients. Those are the only two possibilities. … I’m just going to put this to you and move on, Mr Chew. … You read your paragraph 25. Read it to yourself. Then go and read paragraph 21, and read it to yourself. … They are not consistent with each other, are they?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): No.Question (Mr Sreenivasan): They are consistent?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): No.260 Mr Fong, sought to make a similar point when he cross-examined Mr Jordan Chew.

Question (Mr Fong): I’m now just going to put to you some propositions. I’ve shown you there were, based on the data, some months, entire months, where you did not have a call with Ms Quah within five minutes of an order being entered in the accounts of Peter Chen, Ron Menon and Neo Kim Hock. And you have told the court that it is possible that for these months, Mr Chen, Mr Menon or Mr Neo could have called you or your colleagues to place those orders. Correct?Answer (Mr Jordan Chew): Based on the data, yes.261 This seemed, initially, to cast some doubt on the accuracy of Mr Jordan Chew’s recollection, and the certainty with which he stated that it was only the Second Accused who had ever given him trading instructions in the three aforementioned accounts.

 262 While I appreciated the point both Mr Sreenivasan and Mr Fong were seeking to make – that there was at least some doubt in respect of whether the Second Accused had instructed each and every BAL order placed in Mr Chen, Mr Menon and Mr Neo’s accounts – I did not think that the line of inquiry they pursued affected Mr Jordan Chew’s basic evidence that it had been the Second Accused who gave him instructions. This may or may not have been an absolute conclusion to the exclusion of Mr Chen, Mr Menon and Mr Neo. However, that was beside the point. It was not the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had exercised control of the Relevant Accounts to such a degree that even the Relevant Accountholders could not use them if they wished. The point was whether the accused persons exercised control. 263 My view was that Mr Jordan Chew’s account that it was principally the Second Accused who gave him trading instructions ought to be believed. Several aspects of his testimony pointed me towards this conclusion. First, he was able to provide specific details about the Second Accused’s trading habits. Referring to trades carried out on 27 September 2012, he gave evidence that “[the Second Accused] would have instructed [him] to split up her order into smaller lot sizes”.

 This was also logical. Splitting up orders plainly served the purpose of avoiding undesirable attention in the market while keeping the liquidity of BAL shares at a certain level. Indeed, there was objective evidence to show that the Second Accused understood this. In a series of messages she had exchanged with Ms Cheng on 20 November 2012, it was shown that she understood the importance of breaking up large orders for BAL shares into smaller, less attention-grabbing orders:

This was that the GovTech Evidence contradicted the Prosecution’s case

266 I begin with the latter. In my view, the bases on which I was invited to doubt Mr Jordan Chew’s credibility were rather thin. The First Accused pointed to the fact that Mr Jordan Chew admitted that he had lied to the CAD during its investigation as he did not wish to be implicated in this matter.

 Moreover, in his conditioned statement, he also repeatedly used the word “likely” when referring to examples where he supposedly took instructions from the Second Accused. More specifically, the word was used on five occasions.

267 The first basis was not a sound one. I should not have to explain that it would take a unique case for the court to fairly cast doubt on the credibility of a witness on the sole ground that he had lied before. In ordinary circumstances, something more would be needed. The second basis was not a strong argument either, because it sought to stretch a minor observation to a major conclusion. At one level, Mr Jordan Chew could be said to have remembered generally that the Second Accused had given him trading instructions but had forgotten specific instances where such instructions had been given by her. At this level, communications records shown to him would only have refreshed his memory as to what might have been specific instances of such instructions. At another level, however, it could have been that Mr Jordan Chew simply did not remember who had given him instructions at all. At this level, the communications records would serve the much more substantial function of jogging Mr Jordan Chew’s memory as regards who, in the first place, had given him instructions.268 The First Accused was right that Mr Jordan Chew was only able to say that certain communications with the Second Accused were “likely” to be specific instances of her giving him trading instructions. However, Mr Jordan Chew’s clear evidence was that the Second Accused had generally given him instructions. There was nothing to suggest that he needed assistance in recalling this basic fact. Thus, the First Accused’s argument failed because he sought to elevate the gap in Mr Jordan Chew’s recollection, which plainly pertained to the first level, to one which concerned the second level. There was, in short, no real basis to doubt Mr Jordan Chew’s credibility, and I accepted his evidence.269 This brings me back to the first point raised at [265] above, namely, that the GovTech Evidence contradicted the Prosecution’s case. In this connection, Mr Jordan Chew’s evidence, similar to that of Mr Alex Chew, was that he had communicated with the Second Accused most frequently through BlackBerry messages.

 There is no need for objective evidence in that sense. As stated, I found Mr Jordan Chew to be a credible witness and I accordingly accept his evidence that there would have been BlackBerry messages exchanged between the Second Accused and himself. Indeed, as I have explained at [252]–[253] above, I did not simply take these witnesses’ evidence at face value. There were good reasons to believe that the BlackBerry messages which the TCFB had extracted from the devices seized by the CAD, did not represent a complete record of all messages that had been exchanged.270 Another point made by the First Accused was that, even if instructions had been given to Mr Jordan Chew, those instructions “could not have been” from the Second Accused as it was Mr Chen’s own evidence that he “would not let [her] give instructions”.

 By this, the First Accused was referring to Mr Chen’s testimony as reproduced at [207] above. However, it will be seen that Mr Chen did not state that he did not permit the Second Accused to give trading instructions for his accounts. His specific point was that he was “not comfortable” relaying instructions from her.

 There was no suggestion that he had precluded her from giving instructions directly to Mr Jordan Chew, and, accordingly, this argument failed. 271 Ultimately, the Defence was unable to advance a clear and strong basis for me to reject Mr Jordan Chew’s evidence. I thus accepted it, and found that the Second Accused had controlled the DMG & Partners accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Menon and Mr Neo under the management of Mr Jordan Chew.272 At this point, however, it is useful to recall from [257] that the Prosecution’s case in respect of Mr Neo’s account was that both accused persons gave direct instructions to Mr Jordan Chew. It was not clear why they suggested this to be the case. Mr Jordan Chew did not give evidence that he had received trading instructions from the First Accused in respect of Mr Neo’s account

 I accordingly did not make anything of it. In the circumstances, as the accused persons were facing conspiracy charges, it was sufficient for just one of the accused persons to have been in control of Mr Neo’s account, particularly given that there was no real dispute that the First Accused had been aware of the account’s existence.

These had been held in the names of: (a) Mr Chen; (b) Mr Menon; (c) Mr Neo; (d) Mr Tan BK; and (e) Mr Billy Ooi. The Prosecution’s case in respect of each of these accounts varied.

 As regards the accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi, it was their case that only the First Accused had given direct instructions to Ms Chua or her covering officer, a Mr Teoh Yong Loon. In respect of Mr Neo’s account, it was their case that the First Accused had additionally relayed instructions through Ms Tracy Ooi. Finally, as for Mr Menon’s account, their case was that both accused persons had directly instructed Ms Chua (or Mr Teoh), with the First Accused additionally relaying instructions through Ms Tracy Ooi. 274 Apart from Mr Chen, Ms Chua was the only other person relevant to this subgroup of accounts who was called to give evidence. However, it should be noted that she was the subject of an impeachment application taken out by the Prosecution, who urged the court to accept some but reject other aspects of her evidence.

275 As Mr Chen’s evidence was not relevant to the accounts of Mr Menon, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Billy Ooi, I set out my analysis of his account separately from that pertaining to the remaining four. In respect of Mr Chen’s account, the evidence he gave (see [203]–[228] above) pertained to all 14 of his Relevant Accounts, and, for the same essential reasons, I was satisfied that this account under Ms Chua was similarly controlled by the First Accused as part of a broader scheme. Indeed, the Authorised Persons’ Analysis reflected that Mr Chen had zero proximate communications with Ms Chua during the Relevant Period.

 The GovTech Evidence, accordingly, was entirely consistent with Mr Chen’s testimony.277 In fact, Mr Chen’s testimony sat comfortably with that of Ms Chua. At the trial, when asked who had given her trading instructions in Mr Chen’s account from the time it had been opened on 21 March 2013 until the Crash, Ms Chua answered “[Mr Chen] himself” and the “bank margin officer” (referring to Ms Tracy Ooi).

 Ms Chua’s testimony was different in that she sought to characterise the First Accused’s involvement as a mere messenger who had conveyed Mr Chen’s instructions, thus somewhat justifying her receipt of instructions from the First Accused. However, the material point was that the First Accused had indeed contacted Ms Chua to provide her with trading instructions. Whether those instructions had stemmed from Mr Chen or were from the First Accused himself, was a separate issue. 279 On this issue, Mr Chen’s evidence – which I accepted – was that he was not the decision-maker behind any of the trades placed in any of his 14 Relevant Accounts.

 Ms Chua was not in a particularly strong position to contradict this. Indeed, even if it was accepted that Mr Chen had told her to receive instructions from the First Accused when he was busy, that did not mean Mr Chen was the true source of those instructions. There was simply no way for Ms Chua to know what arrangements had been made between the First Accused and Mr Chen unless she had been told by either of them. However, there was no suggestion that she had been. In any case, I had doubts about her suggestion that the First Accused helped Mr Chen when the latter was busy. It was the First Accused’s own evidence that he was “always busy”,

 frequently being tied up in back-to-back engagements. In that context, it was hard to believe that the directions Mr Chen had given to Ms Chua as a solution to his inability to give instructions – an apparent consequence of his busy schedule – was to turn to a person who was seemingly busier than himself. 280 In the round, nothing in Ms Chua’s testimony gave rise to any real reason to doubt the evidence given by Mr Chen. Thus, as stated, on the footing of his testimony as well as the GovTech Evidence set out at [275]–[276] above, I found that Mr Chen’s account had been controlled by the First Accused.281 This brings me to Ms Chua’s evidence in respect of the other four Relevant Accountholders within this subgroup: Mr Menon, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Billy Ooi. I begin with Mr Menon’s account, in respect of which the Prosecution’s case was that both accused persons had given direct instructions to Ms Chua, and, the First Accused had additionally relayed instructions to Ms Chua through Ms Tracy Ooi (see [273] above).282 This account was opened on 15 January 2010,

 and, according to Ms Chua, Mr Menon had been introduced to her as a client by the Second Accused. Ms Chua was not told why Mr Menon was specifically recommended to her. The Second Accused simply told her that he would be opening an account with her.

 This was, in essence, the same position she took in respect of Mr Chen (as stated above). 283 Notwithstanding Ms Chua’s evidence that she had been informed by Mr Menon that the Second Accused could give trading instructions on his behalf, it was a fact that she had not been formally authorised to do so. This thus raised a question. If there had been a frequent need for the Second Accused to give instructions for Mr Menon whenever he was busy, it could be expected that he and the Second Accused would have formalised such an arrangement with the approval of the FI. That no such formal arrangement had been put into place, in my view, called for the Second Accused’s evidence as to whether there was an innocent explanation for such an arrangement. After all, this was plainly a matter “peculiarly within her knowledge” (see Oh Laye Koh v Public Prosecutor [1994] SGCA 102 (“Oh Laye Koh”) at [14]). 284 As the Second Accused opted not to give evidence in her defence, however, no such explanation was provided. In fact, even if the Second Accused had opted to give evidence, it was not clear if she would have been able to innocently explain her involvement with this account. The Authorised Persons’ Analysis showed that, throughout the Relevant Period, across all three counters, there were only 21 proximate communications between Ms Chua and Mr Menon five minutes before a BAL order had been placed in his account.

 Most of these specifically preceded LionGold orders, which was additionally consistent with the evidence of other TRs who testified that the Second Accused was the one who had typically given them instructions for LionGold. Again, this begged the question – if Mr Menon was indeed so busy and in need of the Second Accused’s assistance in running his trading account, why had formal authorisation not been put in place? On these grounds, it was appropriate to adversely infer that no such explanation existed. 285 On this, I should highlight that the Second Accused argued that the court ought not to draw an adverse inference from her silence as she had good reasons for her election. Chief among which was the fact that she was unrepresented following the close of the Prosecution’s case and, further, that acting in-person would have prejudiced her in a case as complex as this.

 She also advanced several substantive arguments against an adverse inference. First, she contended that the facts did not clearly call for an explanation as the First Accused had provided ample responses to the Prosecution’s case.

286 I did not accept any of these arguments.(a) In relation to the first argument, quite apart from this Relevant Account of Mr Menon, there was much that called for the Second Accused’s explanation. As seen from the discussion above, there were other TRs who also gave clear evidence that the Second Accused had called to give them trading instructions. The First Accused was simply not in a position to explain such evidence, which patently called for her explanation. He was only in a position to account for his own involvement. He could and, in fact, did disavow her involvement in and knowledge of some Relevant Accounts.

 However, it was trite that one could not speak for the state of mind of another. (b) As for the second and third arguments, the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was not circumstantial nor was it weak. Numerous Relevant Accountholders, TRs, and intermediaries gave evidence against both accused persons. This was direct, not circumstantial evidence. Further to this, such direct evidence also stood on and amongst other pieces of objective evidence. 287 In any event, it was clear that the Second Accused’s arguments against an adverse inference being drawn from her silence were general ones. She was seeking to avoid the “ultimate adverse inference” that she was guilty of the offences charged (Oh Laye Koh at [14]). Although I did not agree with her arguments, I did not think that such a broad adverse inference was appropriately drawn in the present case. There were simply too many issues underlying the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, and the Second Accused’s silence alone could not be said, so generally, to lead to the conclusion that every one of those issues ought to be decided against her. A more specific and targeted approach was desirable, and it was the one I took. 288 This brings me to whether the First Accused had also been involved in the use of Mr Menon’s account to place BAL shares. On this point, the Prosecution lacked evidence from Ms Chua that she had received trading instructions from the First Accused specifically in respect of Mr Menon’s account. Thus, the Prosecution sought to rely directly on a crucial email which the Second Accused had sent the First Accused,

 As I found that the GovTech Evidence could not – by itself – sustain the conclusion that the accused persons controlled any of the Relevant Accounts (it only had corroborative value: see [119] above), the email on which the Prosecution relied was vital. That email was sent by the Second Accused to the First Accused on 8 July 2012 and it read:

 This plainly included Mr Ronald Menon and, thus, it could be surmised that Mr Menon’s accounts were nominee accounts which the First Accused had been involved in using to place BAL trades. 290 I accepted this submission. First, as the email mentions CDP statements, it was evident that the pair were talking about trading accounts. Second, the word “nom[inees]” in this context was quite damning when the First Accused was an undischarged bankrupt and not himself able to have share trading accounts. Third, quite apart from the contradiction between the accused persons’ positions, there was nothing about the email which even remotely suggested that the discussion concerned proxy votes at an annual general meeting of some unspecified company. Fourth, if the individuals named had been the accused persons’ nominees, it followed that the First Accused would have been able to place trades in their accounts. Lastly, though it is unclear which of Mr Menon’s accounts the Second Accused had been referring to in her email, this was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. This was because, based on the foregoing, there was – in my judgment – enough foundational evidence upon which the GovTech Evidence could be layered to infer that Mr Menon’s UOB Kay Hian account was one of the accounts being discussed. Thus, on these bases, I found that the First Accused had also been in control of Mr Menon’s account, principally giving trading instructions to Ms Chua for Blumont and Asiasons shares while the Second Accused chiefly instructed her in respect of LionGold shares. 291 Finally, I turn to the accounts of Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi. As mentioned, the Prosecution’s case was that only the First Accused had instructed Ms Chua directly for these accounts. The Second Accused was not said to have been involved. In respect of these accounts, Ms Chua’s evidence was essentially the same as it was for Mr Chen – that Mr Neo,

 had informed her that she could receive instructions from the First Accused, which she sometimes did. She also stated that Ms Tracy Ooi would occasionally give her trading instructions for these accounts as well. However, these third-party instructions would have been accepted because the accountholders had authorised them in some manner. 292 The Prosecution naturally submitted that Ms Chua’s testimony – that the BAL orders came from the accountholders through the accused persons or Ms Tracy Ooi – should not be believed.

 Indeed, as mentioned at [273] above, they even took out an impeachment application against her to that end. However, I did not think this was particularly necessary or useful. It would have been seen from the foregoing paragraphs that Ms Chua ultimately accepted that the accused persons had been variously involved in the giving of instructions for all accounts under her management, not just those of Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Billy Ooi. Thus, whether the accountholders had or had not verbally authorised Ms Chua to receive instructions from the First Accused was beside the point. In the absence of formal authorisation, the First Accused’s involvement alone called for an explanation. 293 As to the rate of the First Accused’s involvement with these accounts, the GovTech Evidence showed that it was not insignificant.

 I could scarcely believe that he would have had the time for so many calls with a TR simply to relay his associates’ instructions and repeatedly promote LionGold shares, much less gossip about politics. In fact, there was no explanation why his associates could not convey their own instructions to Ms Chua.295 Apart from attempting to positively explain his communications with Ms Chua which, as stated, I did not accept, the First Accused also advanced several arguments to undercut the Prosecution’s case. The first was the Clear Days Argument (see [117] above). The second was the fact that there was no evidence of Ms Chua providing the accused persons with trade reports.

 – not fully substantiated.296 I did not accept any of these contentions. (a) As regards the first argument, I will explain the accused persons’ Clear Days Argument in greater detail at [405]–[408] in relation to the Relevant Accounts under the management of Ms Poon. For the same essential reasons that I will set out there, I was not persuaded that the Clear Days Arguments meaningfully challenged the Prosecution’s case and evidence. (b) In respect of the second argument, I will explain from [736]–[743] below that the gaps in the TRs’ trade reporting did not carry as much exculpatory value as the accused persons sought to suggest. In sum, though the objective records adduced by the Prosecution did not directly show the fact of trade reporting for each and every TR, there was such evidence, and the fact that the accused persons had been receiving trade reports at all was revealing. (c) As to the third argument, there was nothing which I could make of the bare allegation against Ms Tracy Ooi. I accepted that it was in the realm of possibility that Ms Tracy Ooi could have been the true controller of the accounts, but it was in my view, quite farfetched. There were two obvious gaps in the logic and evidence it took to reach such a conclusion. First, if it had indeed been Ms Tracy Ooi who had given instructions to Ms Chua, there was no reason why Ms Chua would prefer to implicate the accused persons instead of Ms Tracy Ooi, whom she said only gave instructions occasionally. Even though there was some suggestion that the two were friends,

 as mentioned, Ms Tracy Ooi had passed away by the time Ms Chua gave evidence. As such, there was no reason why Ms Chua would need to protect her from any allegation of improper conduct. Second, the mere fact of substantial communications between Ms Chua and Ms Tracy Ooi was not an answer to the Prosecution’s case that the First Accused had relayed instructions through the latter to Ms Chua. Indeed, there was ample evidence to show that Ms Tracy Ooi was an individual who had assisted the First Accused in relation to a variety of banking-related matters connected with the Relevant Accounts.

297 In any event, apart from: (a) my finding that the First Accused failed to adequately explain why he had been involved in communicating BAL trading instructions to Ms Chua in respect of Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi’s accounts, and (b) my conclusion that his submissions did not meaningfully undermine the Prosecution’s case and evidence, I did not – as a starting point – believe the aspects of Ms Chua’s testimony which seemed to distance the First Accused from the BAL trades in the accounts of Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi. 298 This was because, after careful consideration of the Prosecution’s application to impeach Ms Chua, I agreed that her credit was impeached. There were certainly material inconsistencies in her evidence.

 That said, the matters on which she was inconsistent did not bear very significantly on the question of whether the accused persons had controlled the accounts not only of Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi (but also Mr Chen and Mr Menon), particularly, whether she had in fact received verbal authorisation from the accountholders. Instead, they related chiefly to the extent of Ms Chua’s interactions with the accused persons, and why she did not insist upon the accountholders providing written third-party authorisations for these accounts. That being the character of her inconsistencies, it needed to be asked what was to be made of her evidence. 299 It is trite that the impeachment of a witness’s credibility does not necessarily entail the total rejection of his evidence. The court remains under a duty to evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspects of the witness’s evidence should be accepted, and which should be rejected (see Loganatha Venkatesan and another v Public Prosecutor [2000] 2 SLR(R) 904 at [56], affirmed in Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2018] 4 SLR 1315 at [50]). On this basis, I discounted her evidence that the accountholders had verbally authorised her to receive instructions from the accused persons. Throughout her time on the stand, Ms Chua was evasive. She was not forthcoming with her answers, and there were often long pauses before she answered. It was obvious that she was trying to downplay her degree of familiarity and interactions with both the accused persons, and further, that she knew there was something improper about taking instructions from third parties without written authorisation. However, that I discounted her evidence in this regard did not affect my view that she had in fact received trading instructions from the accused persons. As my analysis above shows, this aspect of Ms Chua’s evidence was supported variously by the objective and GovTech Evidence, not even seriously disputed by the First Accused (though he sought to characterise his involvement as relaying instructions: see [294] above), and entirely unaddressed by the Second Accused. Her evidence on this point, therefore, could be given weight. 300 In conclusion, looking at the evidence in the round, I was satisfied that the five Relevant Accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Menon, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi held with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua had been controlled by the accused persons in connection with their Scheme. To be specific, the accounts other than that of Mr Menon had been controlled only by the First Accused, and that of Mr Menon had been controlled by both the First and Second Accused collectively. (5) Two accounts under Mr Kam301 During the Relevant Period, Mr Kam was the TR for two Relevant Accounts held with AmFraser, one belonging to Mr Chen and another to Mr Goh HC.

 The evidence of three witnesses were relevant to the Prosecution’s case – that of Mr Chen, Mr Goh HC, and, of course, Mr Kam. At [203]–[228] above, I explained in detail why I accepted Mr Chen’s evidence; similarly, at [241] above, I stated that there was no reason to doubt the evidence given by Mr Goh HC. Both of them testified that they had not used their Relevant Accounts, and that the accused persons were the ones who had exercised control of them.

 Such evidence also supported the conclusion that the accounts under Mr Kam’s management had been controlled by the accused persons.303 Beyond that, however, Mr Kam’s evidence also corroborated the testimonies of Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC. I begin with his account in so far as the First Accused’s control was concerned. According to Mr Kam, when the management of the two accounts had been transferred to him, Mr Gan informed him that one “Peter” would be the one calling him to give trading instructions in respect of both accounts.

 Thereafter, Mr Kam did in fact receive calls from a person calling himself “Peter”, who gave instructions for both Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC’s accounts. Mr Kam assumed that the man was Mr Peter Chen but did not take steps to verify whether “Mr Chen” had been properly authorised to give trading instructions for Mr Goh HC’s account. He simply accepted Mr Gan’s explanation that such an arrangement was in place.

 As stated at [198] above, I found the First Accused had been: (a) the primary user of the 3611 number; and (b) the exclusive user of the 678 number. It therefore followed that the First Accused was the individual behind the communications between these numbers and Mr Kam, not “Peter”. Indeed, the Prosecution adduced landline records which revealed that the First Accused had communicated with Mr Kam as “Peter” and had given trading instructions in respect of both Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC’s accounts.

 This was also supported by the Accused Persons’ Analysis which showed, respectively, that 82% and 81.6% of all BAL orders entered in Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC’s accounts during the Relevant Period had been preceded by proximate communications between the First Accused and Mr Kam.

 and, for those reasons, I rejected the First Accused’s contention that Mr Kam lacked credibility. In turn, I accepted Mr Kam’s evidence that he was under the impression that the “Peter” with whom he had been speaking over the phone was in fact Mr Chen. (b) As regards the latter point of why the First Accused had been communicating with Mr Kam at all, he explained that he had paid special attention to Mr Chen’s account from around 2010 to try to help Ms Ung’s family make money, and that he did so because he owed them a debt of gratitude.

 This was entirely unbelievable. It was wholly unclear why Mr Chen’s account had to be used for such an arrangement with Ms Ung, long after the pair had broken off their engagement. There was also no explanation why Mr Chen could not simply take the First Accused’s advice and instruct Mr Kam himself, rather than facilitating an arrangement by which the First Accused needed to impersonate him over the phone. Finally, the First Accused’s narrative also could not accommodate the fact that instructions had also been conveyed in respect of Mr Goh HC’s accounts.

 I found the First Accused’s explanation entirely fantastical and rejected it accordingly.306 In my judgment, the evidence showed that there was little doubt that the First Accused had controlled these accounts of Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC. The question which remained was whether, as the Prosecution alleged (see [302] above), the Second Accused had also exercised such control. On this issue, the only relevant evidence was that of Mr Kam. He stated:

 The first is a Malaysian number 60197726861 and the second is a Singapore number 96189713. 1 believe “Peter” gave me one of these contact numbers initially, and subsequently there were times when “Suling” used the other number to contact me as well.Whenever “Peter” was away, he would tell me to call “Suling” to inform her of the positions falling due in both [Mr Chen’s] and [Mr Goh HC’s] accounts, and ask her whether to pick up or sell the shares. I reported the due positions accordingly to “Suling”, and she would usually call me back a while later to tell me what to do. All in all, I recall that we spoke less than ten times between 2011 and 2013.307 Preliminarily, it should be noted that, as stated at [198(c)] and [211]–[216] above, the 6861 number had been used by the Second Accused, and there was no dispute that 9618 9713 was also a number she had used.

 That in mind, I found that Mr Kam’s testimony was sufficient to call for an explanation from the Second Accused, and, indeed, also enough to sustain an adverse inference against her in light of her silence. As mentioned above, I accepted Mr Kam’s evidence and did not find any issues with his credibility. More particularly, however, I found his measured evidence against her particularly probative, as it was limited within the context of the First Accused’s control of the accounts. Accordingly, on the basis of Mr Kam’s testimony, I found that the Second Accused had also controlled the two Relevant Accounts of Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC under the management of Mr Kam.

First, although he was a remisier, he primarily traded in his own name and made his own profits, rather than earning through commissions on clients’ trades.

 Third, unlike most of the other TRs who featured in this matter, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused persons did not ordinarily give Mr Leroy Lau detailed and specific instructions on BAL trades to place in his account. Instead, they primarily gave him a “general mandate” or “general instructions”, though they occasionally gave him specific trading instructions as they did with other TRs.

309 By way of general background, Mr Leroy Lau had been introduced to the accused persons by Mr Nicholas Ng sometime in 2009. On Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence, the First Accused – around this time – requested that he used his substantial trading limits to trade in LionGold (then known as “Asia Tiger”) in order to create greater liquidity. The First Accused even apparently guaranteed that Mr Leroy Lau would make a profit if he did so,

[The First Accused (“John”)] once again asked me to trade for him, after Think Environment was rebranded to LionGold Corp Ltd (“LionGold”)Sometime in 2011, [Mr Nicholas Ng (“Nicholas”)] once again arranged for John and [the Second Accused (“Su-Ling”)] to meet me. Over the course of this meeting and subsequent meetings, John promoted LionGold heavily to me and elaborated on his plans for LionGold:(a) John explained that Think Environment would rebrand itself to LionGold (this was done in August 2011). Lion Gold would sell its office equipment business (as Asia Tiger) and clean energy business (as Think Environment), and LionGold would reposition itself as a resource and commodities company focusing on gold – this would be the first such stock in South East-Asia. His ultimate aim was to take LionGold to a bigger league of gold mining companies by having gold resources of 10 million ounces of gold. John explained that Lion Gold’s first concession (which means the right to mine) was for a gold mine in Africa, obtained through the contacts of Daim (ex-finance minister of Malaysia). However, this mine was only in an exploration phase, and it was too time consuming, risky, and very costly to try and develop such mines to production phases.(b) John also shared with me that LionGold was the flagship in a group of companies controlled by him, which included LionGold, Asiasons Capital Limited (“Asiasons”) and IPCO International Ltd (of which Su-Ling was the CEO). In describing LionGold as the “flagship”/”mothership” of these companies, John explained that most of his resources (such as physical cash, available trading limit of his proxies) would go towards supporting LionGold trading and acquisitions. I only knew that Blumont Group Ltd (“Blumont”) was part of John’s group of companies sometime later on, towards the end of 2012. I shall refer to Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold collectively as “BAL”.John told me that he needed my help, to use my abilities as a professional trader to work with Su-Ling to trade LionGold shares for him. He explained that he was involved in ongoing LionGold corporate developments, and it was not productive for him to spend his time trading LionGold shares to create liquidity.Based on what John shared with me over the course of these meetings, I seriously considered John’s proposition to trade LionGold shares for him. I did some research into LionGold. Unlike with Asia Tiger and Think Environment, I was genuinely interested in LionGold because I believed strongly in the long-term value of commodities like gold.I also did more research about John … In particular, I recall one meeting where only John and I were present. I met John at his home in Kuala Lumpur in June 2011 … At this meeting:(a) I asked John why I should believe in him, given his bad reputation during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. John explained that it was not his fault, and that he only had a bad reputation because Malaysian politicians had used him as a scapegoat for Malaysia’s financial woes. … He painted himself as a victim of circumstance, and I believed him because I thought what he said was reasonable.(b) John offered me a sweetener. He said that he would give me the option to buy a substantial quantity of LionGold shares (about 30 to 50 million shares) at a substantial 50% discount. This was an incentive for me to participate in the growth of LionGold shares.Soon after meeting John in Kuala Lumpur, I agreed to help John trade LionGold shares. I conveyed my agreement to take part in John’s scheme either to him directly, or informed Nicholas of it. John wanted me to get involved in manipulating the liquidity and price of LionGold. John would set the overall trading strategy, and my role was to help him manage and coordinate all the trading activities in LionGold. One of my key roles was to trade with John and Su-Ling’s proxies to create artificial liquidity – he thus wanted me to coordinate my trading activities in LionGold with Su-Ling. In my view, this sort of collusive trades are illegal because it involves buying/selling shares to a counterparty within the same group, thereby creating a false impression that there is real trading volume.I started trading LionGold in March 2012. I knew from the time I started trading LionGold for John that this was a very big scheme, in terms of the number of proxies’ trading accounts being used by John and Su-Ling. Su-Ling told me from the very outset that she had many proxies trading for her and John.My main role was to drive the trading activities in LionGold for John. However, after I had agreed to help John achieve his plan for LionGold on the trading front, John and Su-Ling also asked me to help them trade in Asiasons, which I did for them. For Blumont, John asked me to start trading from end December 2012, which I did for him. On the whole, the bulk of my trading for John and Su-Ling was in LionGold, and I traded Asiasons and Blumont shares for them less frequently, generally as and when they asked me to.[emphasis added in bold italics]311 On the footing of this general background, Mr Leroy Lau gave evidence that he had, during the Relevant Period, coordinated rollover trades with the accused persons to refresh the positions in other Relevant Accounts by purchasing shares that were due to be picked up or sold after the settlement period (ie, T+5). At the trial, this was often referred to as “market rolling activities”, and Mr Leroy Lau testified that he predominantly coordinated such activities in relation to LionGold shares, and mostly with the Second Accused.

However, he later began carrying out personal trades in Blumont “to maintain a close relationship and contact” with the First Accused since he, as opposed to the Second Accused, was allegedly “more involved in handling Blumont trades, especially from the [middle of] 2013 [and] onwards”. To this end, whenever Mr Leroy Lau wished to rollover Blumont shares, he would have informed the First Accused.

Accordingly, the fundamental issue which needed to be determined was whether his evidence ought to be accepted as the truth.314 In support of Mr Leroy Lau’s account, the Prosecution relied on the following strands of evidence which they submitted were corroborative.

At the very start of the trading day, at 9.02am, Mr Leroy Lau sent a message to the First Accused (to the 678 number) stating: “Wow 1.295 seller so big?”

 This was corroborated by the evidence of Mr Tai and Mr Wong XY who gave evidence that the First Accused had used UOB share financing accounts in order to monetise FOP shares (see [870]–[879] below for more details on how this operated).(d) The fourth strand concerned messages sent by the First Accused by which he communicated specific trading instructions to Mr Leroy Lau. For example, on 1 August 2013, the First Accused sent the following message to Mr Leroy Lau at 3.36pm: “Can take 250 blu for me”.

315 In the round, I accepted the Prosecution’s contention that the evidence of Mr Leroy Lau ought to be believed. I found his account of the facts to be detailed, specific, independently logical, and thus indicative of the truth. Furthermore, it also cohered with the objective evidence adduced. Certainly, there was sufficient to require the accused persons to furnish an explanation for: (a) not only the objective evidence, particularly the text messages exchanged between the First Accused and Mr Leroy Lau; but also (b) why Mr Leroy Lau would have provided such damning testimony against them. 316 In this regard, the First Accused was the party who chiefly led the arguments against Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence. He contended that Mr Leroy Lau was a sophisticated day trader who was a natural counterparty to other market participants.

 Mr Leroy Lau was said to have carried out his own market activities, which included the illegitimate practice of “layering” (see definition at [246(c)] above). On these bases, it was said that Mr Leroy Lau could not have received trading instructions from either him or the Second Accused because the “manner in which his trading activities were carried out would surely require split-second decision trading making in response to market conditions”.

 This accounted for what Mr Leroy Lau was doing if not acting on the instructions of the accused persons. 317 As regards why Mr Leroy Lau might have given the evidence he did, it was contended that he did so to cover up his own wrongdoing.

 And, in an effort to discredit him, the First Accused argued that Mr Leroy Lau had recanted from the position he originally took in his conditioned statement as regards whether and to what extent he had taken instructions from the accused persons. It was said by the First Accused that, in Mr Leroy Lau’s revised account in court, he admitted that he had made his own decisions in relation to trading and that his trading activity had been carried out without instructions from the accused persons. Thus, given his apparent shift in position, it was argued that he was an unreliable witness who ought not to be believed.

 318 In my judgment, the First Accused’s contentions did not answer the evidence given by Mr Leroy Lau. Suggesting that Mr Leroy Lau could not have been controlled because he was a “sophisticated day trader”, a “natural counterparty” to most market participants, had been engaged in illegitimate trading practices such as “layering”, and traded too quickly to receive specific instructions, was somewhat circular in nature. It presumed that control could not be exercised in such circumstances and did not clearly address Mr Leroy Lau’s testimony (as supported by the objective evidence: see [314(a)] above) that he did not need specific instructions when carrying out market rolling activities with the Second Accused, just general information and instructions:

 Question (Mr Fong): So whatever trades that you made in your trading account was entirely your own decision and discretion.

But the quantity, the timing to buy, I can decide.Question (Mr Fong): So you can decide not to buy.Answer (Mr Leroy Lau): I cannot decide not to buy. I say the quantity, per time, the timing, the trade done, I can decide. But if she has to sell 3 million and nobody to buy from her, I must buy what, I cannot decide not to buy. If not how -- all her account will be force-sold what.…Question (Mr Fong): All right, so she doesn’t instruct you, she coordinates with you, but ultimately when, how, how much to carry out a rollover, that’s entirely your decision. Right?Answer (Mr Leroy Lau): No. Depend on how many share she have to sell. It’s not my decision. My decision is a function of her number of proxy account, quantity due for the particular day what.319 In the face of the corroborative objective evidence adduced by the Prosecution, the First Accused’s suggestion that Mr Leroy Lau was lying to cover up his own misconduct needed to be supported by something more. After all, Mr Leroy Lau was not even denying his own misconduct per se. He was essentially admitting to having carried out trading activities which were certainly not legitimate. The question was whether he had done so of his own volition or whether he did so in furtherance of the accused persons’ Scheme. If the First Accused wished to make a cogent argument that it was the former, the starting point was to furnish a basic explanation for the most probative messages on which the Prosecution placed emphasis. 320 However, this was not the First Accused’s approach. When I considered the First Accused’s submissions in relation to Mr Leroy Lau,

 it was clear that the approach taken failed to address the few fundamental points raised above. On this note, I should highlight that the Prosecution submitted in reply that the First Accused was “[u]nable to respond substantively to the highly probative nature of [Mr Leroy Lau’s] evidence” and, thus, that he “deliberately misconstrue[d] [Mr Leroy Lau’s] evidence and focuse[d] on issues which [were] entirely irrelevant”.

 I did not think that it was necessary to characterise the First Accused’s approach as “deliberate”, but the point stood that there was little that had been raised by the First Accused which tackled the thrust of Mr Leroy Lau’s testimony, as well as the keenly probative pieces of objective evidence which supported that testimony. 321 I therefore accepted Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence that the accused persons had exercised control over his account. I was mindful that such control was rather distinct from that exercised over the other Relevant Accounts. However, this did not affect my conclusion. Mr Leroy Lau’s testimony provided a clear and cogent account not only of why he decided to assist the accused persons in their Scheme, but also how he did so. While the manner in which he had done so entailed a greater degree of autonomy than that seen with the other TRs or accountholders, that was wholly attributable to his unique abilities and role within the Scheme. His autonomy certainly did not rise to the level of suggesting that his trading activity in BAL shares was wholly independent of the accused persons. 322 As a final note, I should highlight that, where the Second Accused was concerned, the substantial volume of communications between her and Mr Leroy Lau (throughout the Relevant Period, 1783 communications had been initiated by Mr Leroy Lau

 also called for an explanation. Nothing that had been raised by the First Accused could account for this somewhat glaring fact. That said, I did not think that it was necessary to draw an adverse inference against her where Mr Leroy Lau’s account was concerned, though I was not sure that this made any analytical difference to my view of the evidence. The Second Accused’s election has essentially deprived her of an opportunity to present an account of the facts. Having tested Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence against the First Accused’s arguments, I accepted Mr Leroy Lau’s account. Without anything from the Second Accused, this essentially left me with Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence and no other meaningful basis on which I could or should have doubted its truth. The weight of his evidence thus went against the Second Accused just as much as it did against the First Accused.(7) Eight accounts under Mr Andy Lee323 The next subgroup within Group 1 comprises eight Relevant Accounts held with Lim & Tan under the management of TR Mr Andy Lee.

 The testimony of Mr Chen was relevant to his own accounts and has been extensively discussed (see [203]–[228] above). As regards the other six accounts, the only direct evidence adduced was that of Mr Andy Lee.324 Mr Andy Lee’s testimony was that these eight accounts had been transferred to him sometime in 2003. At the point of transfer, the previous remisier (who was not called to give evidence) informed Mr Andy Lee that they belonged to a “Malaysian syndicate” which would be using them to trade. Mr Andy Lee had also been told that an “Alice” – it was not disputed that this referred to Ms Ang – would be the one giving trading instructions.

 He felt that this was uncommon and it, in turn, led him to suspect that other accounts were being used by the Second Accused to pick up the shares from these sell orders. This suspicion, he stated, was reinforced by the fact that the Second Accused often told him that she was already aware that trades had been executed when he had reported trades to her.

 Mr Andy Lee’s evidence was that the Second Accused had not given any instructions to place buy orders, and that she only instructed the sell trades in those accounts.

328 Apart from instructing trades, Mr Andy Lee also testified that the contra losses suffered in this account had been settled by the Second Accused. Consistent with other TRs (see, for example, [752] below), he stated that the Second Accused would send either Mr Jumaat or Mr Najib to deliver payment.

 In fact, the Second Accused never ever denied responsibility for the more than S$2 million in losses suffered in Mr Richard Ooi and Mr Ong KL’s accounts as a result of the Crash. She even gave Mr Andy Lee instructions on how to negotiate the payment of the losses with Lim & Tan. On several occasions, she even gave him cash to pay off the losses. By contrast, the Relevant Accountholders had not been involved and were even uncontactable.

329 Such testimony obviously called for the Second Accused’s explanation and, without her evidence, there was not much which the Defence offered to persuade me that Mr Andy Lee’s evidence ought not to be accepted. Indeed, the Second Accused did not even make targeted submissions against his evidence to undercut its credibility. Instead, the First Accused was the one who did so. However, I did not accept any of his points.(a) First, it was contended that the four margin accounts under Mr Andy Lee’s management had not been controlled by Second Accused as only sell orders had been entered in these accounts – these orders had only been placed because Lim & Tan had declared the shares non-marginable. It was for this reason that they were sold and, thus, the sales had not been instructed by the Second Accused.

 I did not accept this, although Lim & Tan had declared the shares non-marginable, each of the sales had been preceded by communications between the Second Accused and Mr Andy Lee.

 In my view, this supported the inference that she had to decide to sell the shares.(b) Second, it was argued that the Second Accused could not have been controlling the accounts since Mr Andy Lee had stopped giving trade confirmations and reports.

 As mentioned at [296(b)] above in relation to Ms Chua, I will explain at [736]–[743] that the First Accused’s contention that control could not have been exercised without trade reporting was not persuasive. In any case, in so far as these accounts were concerned, Mr Andy Lee explained that he had reduced the trade reports he sent to the Second Accused because he had formed the impression that she was monitoring the market and knew when trades had been executed.

 (i) he had lied in earlier investigative statements and initially denied the involvement of both Ms Ang and the Second Accused; as well as (ii) admitted that the use of the incriminating words “nominee accounts” in his conditioned statement had been suggested to him by the Prosecution.

 These were, in my view, extremely thin bases on which the First Accused expected me to disbelieve the entirety of Mr Andy Lee’s testimony. In respect of (i), Mr Andy Lee sensibly explained that he did not implicate Ms Ang because he felt that she would not have been responsible for the BAL trades in the accounts after handing control over them to the Second Accused.

 As regards (ii), little could be made of the point unless I was expected to conclude that the Prosecution had coached Mr Andy Lee as a witness. However, such a position would have been wholly baseless and untenable (see [1460]–[1488] below).330 Overall, I accepted Mr Andy Lee’s evidence that the eight accounts under his management had been controlled by the Second Accused. The conclusion was, in fact, particularly strong in respect of Mr Chen’s accounts given his separate evidence that all the Relevant Accounts held in his name had been controlled by the accused persons. It was not the case, however, that only the Second Accused person had an association with these accounts. Mr Andy Lee testified that sometime in 2014, he had asked the First Accused if the monthly repayments of losses to Lim & Tan could be increased. The First Accused agreed and – to Mr Andy Lee’s recollection – this resulted in an increase in repayment for some months.

 Neither Ms Huang nor Mr Kuan AM were called to give evidence. Thus, the only Prosecution witness whose evidence related to these accounts was Mr Lincoln Lee. In general, it was his evidence that he had used these three accounts to “trade on behalf of the [accused persons]”. Mr Lincoln Lee also stated that he had not received any trading instructions from the accountholders, and that he knew the accused persons were not authorised to instruct trades in the accounts, though he accepted their instructions anyway.

I was first approached by my friend, [Cheah Kian Meng (“Cheah”)], sometime in July 2011 about conducting nominee contra trading in LionGold shares. … During the phone call, Cheah asked whether I had proxy accounts which I could use to help him conduct contra trading in LionGold shares. I asked Cheah why he needed a proxy account to trade. Cheah told me that he needed to “roll” some shares, and it would be a short-term thing. As Cheah said it would be a short-term thing, I did not probe further as to why Cheah needed to roll the shares. I was of the impression that the rolling might have been to create some trading volume in the shares for the company to attract investors. I also asked Cheah whether the trades were “safe”, meaning whether losses incurred on the trades would be promptly paid for. Cheah assured me that they would.I agreed to help Cheah on the condition that the trades were not too big and their value did not exceed $100,000. I agreed because Cheah was a friend and I trusted him to settle any losses, and because I believed that the arrangement would be a short-term thing.Cheah thereafter called to give me instructions to conduct nominee contra trading in LionGold shares. I executed Cheah’ s trades in my sister, Lee Lim Yin’s, Kim Eng cash trading account

 … I may also have used accounts belonging to my other clients, after obtaining their consent. …This arrangement where Cheah gave me instructions to conduct nominee contra trading in LionGold shares lasted for about a month. … After the initial month, Cheah asked whether the arrangement could continue for a longer period of time. Cheah also asked whether I could conduct a higher value of trades for him, instead of the $100,000 that was previously agreed.I told Cheah that I was not completely comfortable with a continuing arrangement and in providing more trading limit because I was concerned about whether the losses on the nominee contra trades would be settled… . Cheah told me that he would introduce me to [the Second Accused (“QSL”)]. Cheah said that QSL was the person for whom the trades were being conducted, and QSL could address my concerns directly. Cheah told me that QSL was the [CEO] of [IPCO], which was a listed company. Before this, I had not heard of QSL before and was not aware of her involvement in the trades I was doing for Cheah.[Part 2 – Introduction to the Second Accused]

Cheah arranged for me to meet QSL at QSL’s residence … QSL, Cheah and I were present during the meeting. During the meeting, Cheah asked me to provide them (i.e. QSL and Cheah) with a higher trading limit for the nominee contra trades. QSL assured me that any losses would be settled. QSL also spoke briefly about the prospects of LionGold as a company. She told me that LionGold would be acquiring other gold companies. I think QSL was trying to tell me that the share price would not crash so that I would be comfortable with rolling the shares for a longer period.Given QSL’s status as a CEO of a listed company, I believed her assurance that the losses on the nominee contra trades would be paid. I also believed that the share price of LionGold would not crash. I agreed during the meeting itself to conduct up to $300,000 worth of such trades for QSL.I also asked QSL to bring over her own nominee accounts to me if she wished to trade in a higher value of LionGold shares. I asked for QSL’s nominee accounts to protect myself instead of having losses sitting in my own nominee accounts. QSL agreed to provide me with her own nominee accounts. …[Part 3 – Opening and consolidation of trading accounts]

Shortly after the meeting, QSL arranged for [Ms Huang (“HPM”)] to open a cash trading account with me. This was the first of QSL’s nominee accounts that was opened with me. … Based on the account opening date, which was 27 September 2011, the meeting at QSL’s residence should have taken place sometime in September 2011.Thereafter, QSL arranged for [Mr Lim KY (“LKY”)] and [Mr Tan BK (“TBK”)] to open cash trading accounts with me. LKY and TBK’s cash accounts were opened on 17 October 2011 and 5 December 2011 respectively. [Note that these accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Tan BK were not Relevant Accounts]. QSL further arranged for [Mr Kuan AM’s (“KAM”)] cash and margin trading accounts to be transferred to me from another TR. KAM’s accounts were transferred to me on 10 January 2012. …In addition to opening or transferring nominee accounts, QSL also transferred her personal cash trading account to me. I had requested for this as I was hoping to do other business with QSL as she was a high net-worth client. QSL agreed to transfer her cash account to me. …When QSL transferred her account to me, she expressly told me not to use the account for the nominee contra trading I was helping her to conduct. 335 In respect of Parts 1, 2 and 3, Mr Lincoln Lee gave inconsistent accounts of their proper sequence in his conditioned statements. In Mr Lincoln Lee’s first conditioned statement, he stated the following. (a) First, that he had first been introduced to the Second Accused by Mr Cheah and, that, nothing had materialised from this introduction.

 This was distinct from that stated in Mr Lincoln Lee’s second conditioned statement, wherein he said that the nominee trading arrangement with Mr Cheah had been in place prior to his introduction to the Second Accused.(b) Second, that he had agreed to conduct “up to $300,000 worth of nominee contra trades” for Mr Cheah because the latter had informed him that the Second Accused would cover all contra losses incurred.

 This was also inconsistent with that which Mr Lincoln Lee stated in his second conditioned statement. There, Mr Lincoln Lee said that he had initially agreed to a limit of S$100,000 and this had only been increased to S$300,000 after he had met the Second Accused and she assured him that the contra losses would be covered. (c) Third, after taking nominee trading instructions from Mr Cheah for around one month, the Second Accused had informed him that she would give him instructions directly. The Second Accused started doing so, and Mr Lincoln Lee initially placed the LionGold orders she had instructed in his personal account, his sister’s account, and the account of another client. However, as the orders instructed by the Second Accused started to exceed S$300,000 in the later part of 2011, Mr Lincoln Lee informed the Second Accused that he did not have sufficient trading limit, and that more nominee accounts would be needed in order to carry out her trades. This then led to the opening of Ms Huang’s cash account and the transfer of Mr Kuan AM’s two accounts to Mr Lincoln Lee’s management.

 This was, again, different from what Mr Lincoln Lee had stated in his second conditioned statement.

 After careful consideration, I found this to be a fair explanation. Both statements contained the same basic components of: (a) an arrangement between Mr Lincoln Lee and Mr Cheah for the former to conduct nominee trading for the latter; (b) Mr Lincoln Lee being introduced to the Second Accused by Mr Cheah; (c) the Second Accused being involved in the nominee trading arrangement; (d) the Second Accused arranging for Maybank Kim Eng accounts to be opened with and consolidated under Mr Lincoln Lee’s management; and (e) the Second Accused giving trading instructions to Mr Lincoln Lee to be entered in the nominee accounts.337 Thus, while Mr Lincoln Lee’s first and second conditioned statements certainly differed in their details, they were not so fundamentally inconsistent that doubt was cast even on the most basic and important premises of his evidence. The inconsistencies were, in my view, very reasonably explained by an error in recollection as Mr Lincoln Lee suggested. Accordingly, I did not think anything needed to be made of these differences and I took these parts of his evidence to be that set out in his second conditioned statement. Given the dispute about Mr Lincoln Lee’s credibility, I should also state expressly that the inconsistencies did not, in my assessment, affect the veracity of his evidence. 338 I turn next to Parts 4 to 10 of Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence as set out in his second conditioned statement. (a) As to Part 4, Mr Lincoln Lee testified that shortly after meeting the Second Accused, he was told by Mr Cheah that she would give him trading instructions for the nominee accounts under his management. She did so using a Singapore number, 9650 6523, and generally gave him instructions to trade on a contra basis, as well as to roll over LionGold shares. Mr Lincoln Lee also stated that the Second Accused would call him to give him instructions on the date of settlement (ie, T+5), but, on the occasions when she did not, he would contact her to remind her to do so.

(b) As to Part 5, Mr Lincoln Lee testified that Maybank Kim Eng imposed certain trading restrictions on him. Thus, in early 2012, he arranged for Mr Lim KY and Mr Tan BK’s cash accounts to be transferred, respectively, to Mr Alex Teo and Mr Daniel Lim, who were friends of Mr Lincoln Lee and also TRs in Maybank Kim Eng. This was done to reduce Mr Lincoln Lee’s exposure to one counter (ie, LionGold), and to avoid having to use “so many accounts to constantly “roll” in the same share”. This was a way for Mr Lincoln Lee to “get around the restrictions” and it was also beneficial for Mr Alex Teo and Mr Daniel Lim who would earn commission from the nominee trades. According to Mr Lincoln Lee, the transferred accounts would be used whenever the nominee accounts under his management had insufficient trading limits, and he would cause Mr Alex Teo and Mr Daniel Lim to enter orders by passing on the Second Accused’s instructions.

(c) As to Part 6, Mr Lincoln Lee testified that not long after the Second Accused had started giving him trading instructions for the nominee accounts, she told him that “Dato John” would also begin doing so. When Mr Lincoln Lee queried who “Dato John” was, the Second Accused allegedly referred to him as “Towkay”, meaning “big boss”. Thereafter, the First Accused started calling Mr Lincoln Lee, using the 678 number, to give the latter trading instructions. On Mr Lincoln Lee’s account, such instructions were initially limited to Asiasons shares, but, in the second half of 2012, he began doing so for Blumont shares as well. Even after the First Accused had started giving Mr Lincoln Lee instructions for Asiasons and Blumont shares, the Second Accused had continued to do so for LionGold shares. Indeed, Mr Lincoln Lee specifically said that: “It was very rare for [the First Accused] and [the Second Accused] to give instructions for the other person’s counters”.

(d) As to Part 7, Mr Lincoln Lee testified that the accused persons’ use of the nominee trading accounts grew over the course of 2012, and that the trading limits of the accounts were insufficient to complete their orders. Accordingly, they had asked him to source for more accounts that they could use. Mr Lincoln Lee gave evidence that he did so in a variety of ways. First, he had used his as well as his sister’s personal accounts. Second, he had approached some of his clients for permission to use their accounts with Maybank Kim Eng. Third, he had also approached TRs from other FIs (that he knew socially) to ask if they were interested in carrying out trades for the accused persons. Mr Lincoln Lee managed to secure several accounts for the accused persons’ use by these means.

Saliently, Mr Gwee informed Mr Lincoln Lee that Mr Gan would be calling him to give trading instructions. Mr Lincoln Lee was not acquainted with Mr Gan and did not meet him until after the Crash. But he testified that after this meeting with the First Accused and Mr Gwee, Mr Gan did in fact call to give him trading instructions in respect of Asiasons shares (this cohered with the evidence of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa: see [681]–[682] below).

Sometime in early 2015, MAS called me up to assist in investigations. Initially, I did not tell the investigators the truth that the nominee trades were placed by QSL and JS in the Accounts. …I did not tell the truth was because I was reliant on JS to pay for the losses. I also did this because I knew that it was wrong under the law to take trading instructions from a third party without written authorisation from the accountholder that is approved by the brokerage. I wish to add that another reason why I did not tell the truth because of conversations that I had with JS. When the investigations first began, JS was called up by CAD for investigations. At that time, he asked me whether I had been called up. I had not yet been called and told him so.When I was eventually called up by CAD for investigations, about one year later in 2015, I informed JS before I went for the interview. JS told me to be as vague as possible in my answers. JS told me that that I would likely be asked whether I knew him, and I would be shown a photograph of him.JS gave me a few examples of what I could say to explain away the evidence that I might be shown: (a) He mentioned that CAD would likely show me call records showing that JS had called me shortly before orders were placed in the client accounts. JS suggested that I could explain this by saying that JS was calling me to ask about the prices of shares; [and] (b) JS also suggested that I could say that I had been given discretion to trade by the clients to explain the absence of calls from the clients before trades were placed in their accounts.I understood this to mean that I should conceal the involvement of JS and QSL in giving instructions for the nominee accounts. JS also asked me to update him on what I had told the investigating authorities.As suggested by JS, when asked about the calls from JS, I told CAD that the calls from JS were mainly him asking about the prices of shares. I informed JS about this and told him that I had given vague answers as he suggested. JS was pleased and said “good”.After this, JS asked me to continue to update him about what I told CAD in the interviews. I had no choice but to do so as I was still reliant on JS to pay for the losses. As such, I continued to update him about what I had told the CAD. I also continued to lie to the CAD until sometime in September 2017 … [because] after JS was remanded in custody, I stopped receiving any payments. Further, I began to feel concerned that if I did not tell the truth, my lies would be exposed if this matter proceeded to Court, as I would not be able to explain the numerous calls made by QSL and JS to me at the material time. [Thus,] [s]ometime in September 2017, I decided to cooperate fully with the authorities and tell the truth.339 Having set out the detailed account Mr Lincoln Lee gave in court, I turn to: (a) the First Accused’s application to impeach his credibility on the basis of material inconsistencies between his testimony in court and his prior statements given to the CAD; and (b) the more general arguments made by the Defence to undermine his credibility. 340 As to the former, the First Accused relied on a single but salient inconsistency between Mr Lincoln Lee’s testimony in court and the information he had given the CAD. In court, he stated that the Relevant Accountholders, Ms Huang and Mr Kuan AM, had not called him to give any trading instructions (see [331] above).

 During his interviews with the CAD, however, he positively stated that the trades in Ms Huang’s cash account had either been instructed by her personally or her husband, Mr Goh HC. In respect of Mr Kuan AM’s two accounts, he said that trading instructions had been given by Mr Kuan AM personally. Negatively, he also stated that there were “no instances when another party [had] instructed [him] to place trades” in those accounts. There were also “no instances when [he] [had] accepted instructions from [another person]”.

341 There was no dispute that Mr Lincoln Lee’s testimony directly and materially contradicted the information he had earlier given the CAD. The issue which arose was what to make of this contradiction. (a) The Prosecution contended that the difference had been accounted for by: (i) Mr Lincoln Lee’s explanation that he was afraid of incriminating the accused persons because he was still reliant on them to repay the losses suffered in the accounts he had managed; and (ii) the First Accused’s witness tampering.

 Therefore, they said that the evidence he gave in court ought to be believed.(b) On the other end, the First Accused argued that Mr Lincoln Lee’s explanations were unconvincing. In particular, he cited instances where Mr Lincoln Lee had been able to give extremely detailed answers to the CAD in response to largely straightforward questions. His ability to provide such details, it was submitted, indicated that he was likely telling the truth in his statements, or that he was a “very convincing liar”.

342 I did not accept the First Accused’s submissions and found that Mr Lincoln Lee had managed to provide convincing explanations for why he had earlier lied to the CAD. I arrived at this conclusion for two general reasons. First, I found that the overall weight of the evidence stood in far greater support of the view that Mr Lincoln Lee had lied to the CAD for the reasons he gave (see [338(g)] above). Second, I did not think that the apparently specific details Mr Lincoln Lee had given the CAD were indicative of the truth. 343 To begin, the specific details on which the First Accused based his arguments pertained to a mobile phone Mr Kuan AM apparently gave Mr Lincoln Lee. The relevant questions that the CAD had asked and the relevant answers given by Mr Lincoln Lee were:

Statement recorded on 4 March 2015Question 22: Please list all the number(s) you had used to communicate with your clients between 2010 to date.Answer: I will use my mobile number 9336 8828. In 2011, a client by the name of Kuan Ah Ming gave me a mobile phone so that he can contact me at all times. During that period of time the market was very active and he complained that he always cannot reach me via my mobile phone. So he gave me a mobile phone. I do not remember the number of that mobile phone. I will put the mobile phone in my office. I will switch off this mobile phone after office hours. If Kuan Ah Ming calls me after office hours, he will call me via my mobile number 9336 8828. He will only contact me via that mobile phone during trading hours. Kuan Ah Ming has used many numbers to contact me via that mobile phone. There were occasions when he used Malaysian and China numbers to call me. Kuan Ah Ming trades very frequently between 2011 and 2013. He generated a lot of commission for me. He calls me almost ever day to place trades in his account. He also calls me to ask for market prices of counters. As I communicated with him very frequently during that period of time, I could recognise his voice. There was no other person who called me via that mobile phone. This was a phone catered exclusive to Kuan Ah Ming. …Question 80: You mentioned that Kuan Ah Ming gave you a mobile phone. Can you describe the mobile phone?Answer: The mobile phone case is a red sports car, looks either a Ferrari or Lamborghini.…Statement recorded on 11 March 2015Question 84: I refer to your answer for Question 80 where you described the mobile phone which Kuan Ah Ming gave you. Please provide more descriptions to the phone.Answer: The phone is shaped in a sports car, either Ferrari or Lamborghini model. I think there is a horse logo printed on the phone. The material of the phone is plastic. The color of the phone is red and black. I am not sure if the phone is clamshell or a slide phone.Question 85: Did Kuan Ah Ming pass the phone to you in the presence of anyone?Answer: I remember he drove to my office at North Canal Road and told me to meet him downstairs. When I met him, he passed me the phone and told me that he will contact me via this phone. There were no other persons around when Kuan Ah Ming passed the phone to me. He had already saved three Singapore numbers (listed as K1, K2 and K3), one Malaysian number (listed as K4) and one China number (listed as K5) in the phone. There were no other numbers saved in the phone. He told me to call him in the order if he does not pick up (i.e. K1 then K2 then K3).However, I rarely call him as he is the one who calls in every day. On the instances when I called him, I called K1 first and he picks up 50% of the time. If he does not pick up K1, I will call K2. If he does not pick up K2, I will call K3. I cannot remember the number of times I have called Kuan Ah Ming. He will let me know when he is going overseas. I have called K4 before. I have never called K5 before. He will call me at the end of the day for trade confirmations. I cannot remember if there were any instances when he does not call me at the end of the day for trade confirmations. There is no fixed number which he uses to call me but I remember he used all 3 numbers (i.e. K1, K2 and K3) to call me before. 344 When questioned about these answers at the trial, Mr Lincoln Lee stated that the responses had not been made up on the spot. Rather, he and Mr Kuan AM had met beforehand to concoct an account. On that footing, Mr Sreenivasan put to Mr Lincoln Lee that he had been in direct communication with Mr Kuan AM “all along” and, contrary to his statement that Mr Kuan AM had not contacted him to give trading instructions, there had been a direct line of contact between Mr Lincoln Lee and Mr Kuan AM. As I understood it, this in turn suggested that Mr Kuan AM had given direct trading instructions to Mr Lincoln Lee in respect of his own two accounts.

345 I appreciated the point Mr Sreenivasan was seeking to make. However, it did not follow – just because Mr Lincoln Lee and Mr Kuan AM had been in contact after the Crash – that the two must also have been in communication during the Relevant Period. Even if the pair had communicated during the Relevant Period, it also did not necessarily follow that those communications contained trading instructions. And, finally, even if Mr Kuan AM had given Mr Lincoln Lee trading instructions during the Relevant Period, that did not mean that the accused persons could not also have instructed trades in the accounts.346 Indeed, the most fundamental problem with this hypothesis was the fact that the GovTech Evidence – specifically the Accused Persons’ Analysis – was consistent with Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence in court. (a) Throughout the entire Relevant Period, there were 103, 17 and 55 instances of proximate communications between the First Accused and Mr Lincoln Lee shortly preceding Blumont orders being entered, respectively, in Ms Huang’s cash account, Mr Kuan AM’s margin and cash accounts.

347 Apart from the communications that had been proximate to BAL trades, there was also the raw number of communications between the accused persons and Mr Lincoln Lee. When the CAD had asked Mr Lincoln Lee how often the First Accused contacted him, Mr Lincoln Lee answered: “[b]etween 2011 and 2013, John Soh call[ed] me once or twice per month to ask whether anyone [was] interested in taking placement shares in LionGold or Asiasons and buying coal mine companies” [emphasis added].

 Given this, the clear and obvious inference to be drawn from Mr Lincoln Lee’s false answer to the CAD was that he had been attempting to conceal the extent of his relationship with the First Accused, most probably both for his own benefit as well as that of the First Accused. After all, if the First Accused genuinely had nothing to do with the use of Ms Huang or Mr Kuan AM’s accounts, there would have been no reason for Mr Lincoln Lee to lie about the number of communications he had with the First Accused.348 Mr Sreenivasan also made the point that Mr Kuan AM had taken the same basic position as Mr Lincoln Lee during his interviews with the CAD. While Mr Kuan AM’s CAD statements were not adduced as evidence and, indeed, the Prosecution objected to Mr Sreenivasan putting the point to Mr Lincoln Lee, it was not disputed that Mr Kuan AM had in fact also informed the CAD that he had given Mr Lincoln Lee a mobile phone.

 That being so, it was equally possible that Mr Lincoln Lee and Mr Kuan AM had concocted the story about the mobile phone, as it was that they had both been telling the truth during their interviews with the CAD. Whether it was one or the other, therefore, had to be determined by reference to the surrounding context and evidence.349 The GovTech Evidence, as just discussed, supported the conclusion that Mr Lincoln Lee (and, by extension, Mr Kuan AM) had been lying to the CAD. So did Mr Lincoln Lee’s believable explanation that he was afraid of incriminating the accused persons because he remained reliant on them to pay off the losses which had been incurred in the accounts. This explanation was particularly persuasive considering Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence that the First Accused had essentially asked him to conceal the accused persons’ involvement from the authorities, a request which was – in turn – consistent with the findings I made in respect of the Witness Tampering Charges concerning Mr Gan, Mr Tai, Mr Chen and Mr Wong XY (see [1197]–[1298] below). 350 The only consideration which seemed to pull in the opposite direction was the specificity with which Mr Lincoln Lee had been able to describe the alleged mobile phone (see [343] above). However, the support which this provided to the First Accused’s position was superficial at best. In fact, when I read Mr Lincoln Lee’s overly detailed responses to general questions, I could not help but come away with the impression that he was seeking to imbue his account with as much detail as he feasibly could, with the hopes of making it as believable as possible. Additionally, it was extremely convenient that the mobile phone in question could not be produced, or its number even stated.

 Therefore, I did not accept that the specific details provided by Mr Lincoln Lee to the CAD indicated that he had been telling the truth there and, conversely, lying in court.351  In toto, for all these reasons, I did not find that Mr Lincoln Lee’s credit had been impeached. I accepted the clear and simple explanation provided by Mr Lincoln Lee that he had lied to the CAD because he was afraid of losing the monetary support of the accused persons, on which he had been relying to repay the losses suffered as a result of the Crash. The question which fell to be answered upon my conclusion that Mr Lincoln Lee’s credit had not been impeached was whether his account in court, in turn, ought to be believed. 352 In this regard, as alluded at [339] above, the Defence sought to undermine the credibility of Mr Lincoln Lee’s testimony more generally, apart from the impeachment application. They did so by three arguments.

One, Mr Lincoln Lee had lied about the accused persons’ efforts to increase trading limits by gathering trading accounts. The account of Mr Tan BK (see [334] above, “Part 3 – Opening and consolidation of trading accounts”) had not even been used; accordingly, there would not have been insufficient trading limits.

 (also see [129] and [130(a)] above and [648]–[726] below) and had been running their own scheme unbeknownst to the accused persons, the BAL orders placed by Mr Lincoln Lee on Mr Gan’s instructions could not be attributed to the accused persons. (c) The third and final argument was that Mr Lincoln Lee was not a credible witness because: (i) “he admitted to committing perjury twice”; (ii) “he agreed that he had committed several offences in relation to the present case”; and (iii) “he also admitted to lying in his investigative statements to minimise his own involvement”.

353 The second sub-contention of the first argument was without merit. The fact that the usage of other accounts had been the subject of separate civil proceedings was entirely equivocal. The second argument also could not hold. As I will explain from [648]–[726] below, I did not accept the Defence’s broader case that the Manhattan House Group (which included Mr Gwee and Mr Gan) had operated independently of the accused persons. Thus, the fact that Mr Gan had given trading instructions to Mr Lincoln Lee for a time did not take the accounts of Ms Huang and Mr Kuan AM outside the accused persons’ sphere of influence. Finally, the third argument amounted essentially to “Mr Lincoln Lee has lied before so he cannot be trusted now”. Advanced at this level of generality, this was a strained submission at best. And, in any event, as explained at [339]–[351] above, I was satisfied with the explanations provided by Mr Lincoln Lee as to why he had previously lied.354 Only the first sub-contention of the first argument had merit. Although the Defence was not accurate in stating the account of Mr Tan BK had not been used at all, there was no dispute that it had only been used outside the Relevant Period between December 2011 and March 2012.

 This did not square with Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence that, “[a]s the volume of the nominee contra trades grew over the course of 2012, even the additional trading limits of [Mr Lim KY] and [Mr Tan BK’s] cash accounts were insufficient to complete [the accused persons’] orders”.

355 The question was what to make of this specific contradiction between Mr Lincoln Lee’s testimony and the objective trading data. In my view, the answer was nothing substantive. Against the backdrop of all the other points addressed above, this contradiction was weak at best and, more importantly, it did nothing to undermine the crucial evidence which showed that the accused persons had been the ones behind the trading instructions given in respect of Ms Huang and Mr Kuan AM’s accounts. 356 It is useful to round off my analysis of whether the accused persons had controlled these three accounts by reference to two points which demonstrated the utter lack of a meaningful answer to the Prosecution’s case and evidence. In respect of the First Accused, it was claimed that he had communicated with Mr Lincoln Lee “because Lincoln was a hardcore gambler who had a lot of mainland Chinese gambling friends, whom he [had] introduced to the [First] Accused to look into investments as well as to introduce gold mines to the [First] Accused”.

 an explanation was certainly called for. In the absence of one from her, it was appropriate to infer that an innocent one did not exist.

The First Accused’s involvement, he said, was limited to giving him trading “advice”. 358 The Prosecution applied to impeach Mr Hong’s credit and, for reasons I will turn to momentarily, I found his credit to have been impeached.

 Mr Hong provided two conflicting versions. I shall refer to these as the “first version(s)” and “second version(s)”.361 Generally, in the first versions, Mr Hong claimed to have had limited contact with the accused persons, and that they had little involvement in his trading accounts. In the second versions, when confronted with objective evidence showing the accused persons’ involvement in his accounts, Mr Hong claimed that the First Accused was his personal financial advisor, and that he had allowed the accused persons to place trades in his trading accounts directly with certain TRs. Both versions were, in turn, inconsistent with his evidence in court on the accused persons’ role and involvement in his trading accounts. With this general position in mind, I turn to the specific areas of inconsistency raised by the Prosecution. I chiefly address the first, third, fifth and sixth areas as, in my judgment, these were the most pertinent. Indeed, even absent the second and fourth areas, I found that they were sufficient to support the conclusion that Mr Hong’s credit was impeached.362 The first area concerned Mr Hong’s relationship with the First Accused. (a) In the first version (which was given in a statement recorded on 2 April 2014), Mr Hong claimed that he had only met the First Accused “around 2–3 times”, after first meeting him at a social event in 2000 or 2001. Very pertinently, Mr Hong claimed that the two or three times he had met the First Accused were “accidental” when he happened to “bump into him”. Mr Hong also stated unequivocally that these were the “only instances [he] had met the [First Accused]”.

 (b) In the second version (which was given in a statement recorded on 20 August 2014), Mr Hong then claimed that he had met the First Accused once or twice before 2011. After 2011, they had met a “few more” times. According to Mr Hong, these meetings had been held because Mr Neo wished to obtain from the First Accused contacts and information relevant to Blumont’s business. Mr Hong stated that he may have, at these meetings sought the First Accused’s advice regarding his personal investments. However, he said that he “really [could not] remember the reason why [he] would have allowed [the First Accused] to place the trades in [his] account”.

 (c) In court, Mr Hong testified that he had first met the First Accused in 2002 or 2003, and that they had kept in constant contact after that, “meeting once every two or three months”. Subsequently, the First Accused was said to have become an advisor to him, giving him “financial advice for share investments”. This was around a year or two after they were introduced. From then on, he contacted the First Accused daily for his advice in relation to trading in equities. Mr Hong also claimed that in 2011 or 2012, the meetings with the First Accused became more specific because the First Accused had become instrumental in helping Blumont look for mining investments.

In the second version, Mr Hong had clearly been discussing periods after his and the First Accused’s initial meeting. Yet, Mr Hong still did not disclose that the First Accused had been, apparently, his personal financial advisor. When asked how he could have forgotten to mention that he and the First Accused had such a close relationship, he said he would not be able to answer, and that he was trying to answer the questions asked of him to the best of his recollection.

 This was wholly unconvincing. It could not be that in 2014, Mr Hong would not have been able to remember his close interactions with the First Accused and, yet, be able to remember them in court. It was clear that Mr Hong simply had to admit to more interactions with the First Accused because of the objective evidence adduced in court.364 I turn next to the third area, which concerned who had placed orders in Mr Hong’s personal accounts. (a) In the first version, Mr Hong repeatedly told the CAD that he was the only one who had given instructions to the TRs to place orders in his accounts. If he had ever asked someone else to place orders on his behalf, he said, it could have been his secretary.

 Mr Hong said unequivocally that he had let the First Accused manage these accounts. By this, he meant that the First Accused was “able to place trades without going through [him] or requiring [his] approval”. However, Mr Hong said he was quite certain that he had placed his own trades in his OCBC Securities, CIMB and UOB Kay Hian accounts.

(c) In court, Mr Hong then said that 90% of the time, he was the one to place the orders entered in his accounts. He claimed that whenever he was not available, and the example he gave was when he was on a flight, he would then engage the help of either the First or Second Accused to call the relevant TR to execute the trade. Mr Hong was certain they had assisted him in this manner in respect of the orders entered in all his accounts, with the exception of the accounts he had held with CIMB and OCBC Securities.

365 During the trial, when Mr Hong was asked to explain the first version, he claimed that he could not recall, at the time, whether others had placed the trades in the accounts, and that there had been a lapse in his memory. He alternatively explained that he could have been deliberately distancing himself from the accused persons. As regards the second version, Mr Hong explained that – at the time of the later interviews – he could recall the arrangement with the First Accused because he had been shown certain messages between the First Accused and Mr Alex Chew, the TR who managed Mr Hong’s two accounts with DMG & Partners.

366 These were serious inconsistencies. The extent to which the First Accused had been involved in the trades conducted in Mr Hong’s accounts was clearly a key issue in the case. Although I accepted Mr Hong’s explanation that in giving his first version, he had probably been trying to hide his arrangement with the accused persons, what he failed to explain adequately was why – in his evidence in court – he had shifted again from his second version. This seemed to me to have been a further attempt to minimise the accused persons’ involvement with his accounts, to limit it to just a few occasions on which they might have given trading instructions.367 Lastly, I turn to the fifth and sixth areas, which concerned the issue of who had made the decisions for the trades placed in Mr Hong and G1 Investments’ accounts

He even went as far as to say that the First Accused’s trading advice was so specific as to address the price at which he ought to sell, when he ought to sell, and the volume of shares he ought to sell. Mr Hong maintained that notwithstanding the First Accused’s advice, he was the one making the ultimate trading decisions.

 Seen in this light, it was one thing to suggest that the First Accused had given Mr Hong general advice on market trends, and quite another to say that he had given specific, detailed advice as to the trades Mr Hong should place. The former was plausible but the latter was not. 370 The First Accused sought to explain his willingness to help Mr Hong despite his busy schedule, because of the latter’s relationship with Mr Neo (who, as stated at [30] above, was also a close associate of the First Accused). This, however, begged more questions than it answered. Again, on the First Accused’s own evidence, Mr Hong was already a “high net-worth individual”. This being the case, one would expect that Mr Hong would be more than capable of managing his own wealth, or at least have financial managers to assist him in doing so. The need for the First Accused to fulfil such a role, especially given how busy he was, and at the level of detail seen in his exchanges with Mr Hong (see [358] above), was simply unbelievable.371 Accordingly, based on the inconsistencies between the various positions Mr Hong took during the investigation and in court, I found that his credit was impeached. His obvious lack of candour at the trial – evident from his refusal to explain the glaring inconsistencies between his positions, even when confronted with objective evidence – further supported this finding. I therefore did not accept his explanation that the First Accused had merely been providing advice in respect of the trades placed in his and G1 Investments’ accounts. Naturally, this included Mr Hong’s account with CIMB.372 If the First Accused had not been giving advice, then the question was what to make of the communications reproduced at [358] above. In my judgment, the answer was obvious. The messages exchanged between Mr Hong and the First Accused showed clearly that the latter had been giving instructions to Mr Hong. The character of those instructions also readily demonstrated that the First Accused had exercised control over the account. After all, there did not appear to be even a single instance where Mr Hong had rejected the First Accused’s instructions. 373 As to the Second Accused, I found that she had also been involved in the control of Mr Hong’s CIMB account. Despite Mr Hong initially informing the CAD that he had little to no contact with the Second Accused,

 These were the second and fourth areas of inconsistency which arose between Mr Hong’s statements to the CAD and his evidence in court. By his position in court, Mr Hong was plainly seeking to downplay the Second Accused’s involvement in line with the position he had taken in respect of the First Accused. However, Mr Hong could not maintain his original position that the Second Accused had never been involved in the use of his accounts. Thus, having found that the First Accused had been in control of Mr Hong’s accounts, the conclusion also followed for the Second Accused. Accordingly, I found that the accused persons had exercised control over Mr Hong’s account with CIMB by relaying trading instructions to him, instructions on which he would act.(10) Six accounts under Mr Jack Ng374 Mr Jack Ng was the TR for six Relevant Accounts held with OCBC Securities in Group 1. These accounts comprised one in the name of Mr Goh HC (opened in June 2008), two in the name of Ms Ng SL (one opened in June 2008 and the other opened in December 2010),

 Mr Goh HC’s evidence was relevant to his account, but none of the other accountholders gave evidence. In respect of those accounts, only Mr Jack Ng’s evidence was relevant.375 Two aspects of Mr Jack Ng’s evidence were crucial. The first pertained to the circumstances in which he came to receive instructions from the Second Accused for the above six accounts. The second concerned how he, thereafter, also came to take instructions from the First Accused, albeit under the pseudonym, “Peter Chew”. On the former, Mr Jack Ng said:

After each of the nominee’s accounts were opened, the nominees gave me trading instructions for their respective accounts. However, about one to two months after each nominee’s account was opened, [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] then called me and told me that she wanted to place orders on behalf of the nominees because they were very busy. She also told me to report the trades in these accounts to her. On each of such occasion, I then checked with the respective nominees and all of them agreed to QSL giving trade instructions for their accounts and reporting the trades to QSL.After checking with the nominees, I mailed the third party authorisation forms to each of the nominees for them to authorise QSL to give instructions on their behalf. However, none of the nominees submitted the form to me. I subsequently called the nominees GHC, KAM, and NSL, and they told me that QSL had told them the form was not needed. I also called LSH, who is QSL’s mother, and she told me she will ask QSL to hand the form to me. I then spoke to QSL on the phone. QSL asked me why OSPL was so particular about the need for third party authorisation forms. She then told me that if OSPL insisted on written authorisation, she would leave OSPL and go to another brokerage firm. As I feared losing her and her friends as clients, I did not press her for the third party authorisation forms, and agreed to QSL’s arrangement, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.QSL called me on my mobile phone to give trade instructions for the nominees’ accounts using the number 9650 6523. Sometimes, she would use the Malaysian number +60 19772 6861 to call me. She rarely called me on my office lines.376 In respect of the First Accused, Mr Jack Ng stated:

Sometime after QSL began giving trade instructions in the nominee accounts, I started receiving trading instructions from “Peter Chew”. On one occasion, QSL told me over the phone that she was going on leave and that her colleague, “Peter Chew”, would take over and give trade instructions in the nominee accounts.The next day, I received a phone call from “Peter Chew” on my mobile phone. He introduced himself as QSL’s colleague and gave me instructions for the nominees. Approximately one or two days later, I received a phone call from QSL continuing with her practice of giving me trade instructions for the nominees’ accounts. However, that same day, “Peter Chew” also called to give me trade instructions for the nominees’ accounts. I assumed that “Peter Chew” was helping QSL give trade instructions and therefore I carried them out. After that, “Peter Chew” continued to call me to give me trade instructions for the nominees’ accounts and I carried out the instructions. This continued up till the crash.“Peter Chew” would call me on my mobile phone using two Malaysian numbers, +60 12312 3611 – which I saved as ‘Pete’ and ‘Pete 1’ in my previous iPhone or +60 12304 0678 – which I saved as ‘Pete2’ in my previous iPhone. ……After the penny stock crash in early October 2013, I began chasing QSL and [Mr Kuan AM (“KAM”)] for outstanding contra losses … I called KAM about the losses in his cash account. He told me to speak to QSL about the losses. … QSL told me to meet her at LionGold’s office at Mohammed Sultan Road. I remember going to LionGold’s office during a week day in the afternoon. There, I waited for about an hour for QSL in LionGold’s meeting room but she did not show up. Instead, a gentleman walked into the meeting room. I found him familiar and recognised him as [John Soh (“JS”)] because I had seen photographs of him in the newspapers during the 1980s or 1990s. He was a prominent figure in the stock market at that time.JS greeted me. He asked me “what is the problem” and I gave him details of the losses … He told me not to worry and that he would “settle everything” for me. I then asked him for his contact number, and JS gave me two contact numbers. I realised that the contact numbers JS gave me were the numbers “Peter Chew” used to contact me. I asked JS if he was “Peter Chew”. JS just smiled at my question. After that, JS said he had a meeting, and left. Before he left, he told me “don’t worry Jack, I will settle.”377 Apart from Mr Goh HC’s evidence that the trades executed in his and Ms Huang’s accounts did not belong to them (see [241] above), there were several other pieces of evidence which supported Mr Jack Ng’s broader account in relation to the other accounts. In my judgment, four were probative.(a) First, as reproduced at [58] above, there were communications records which showed Mr Jack Ng reporting to the accused persons, the trades that had been carried out in the Relevant Accounts.

 that they existed at all was revealing. As I will explain from [736]–[743] below, there was simply no legitimate reason for the accused persons to be receiving trade reports in respect of accounts they had no authority to use or control.(b) Second, for the Relevant Period, between 85.1% and 92.7% of BAL orders entered in the accounts of Mr Goh HC, Ms Ng SL, Mr Kuan AM, and Ms Lim SH had been preceded by proximate communications between the accused persons and Mr Jack Ng.

378 All this evidence certainly called for the accused persons to provide an explanation. Given the Second Accused’s election to remain silent, she could not provide one and it was reasonable to infer that she did not have one. In fact, given the weight of the evidence, it was difficult to envision what innocent and cogent explanation she would have been able to give. 379 As for the First Accused, he testified that he had only given advice or relayed instructions in respect of Mr Goh HC and Mr Kuan AM’s accounts. His claim in respect of Mr Goh HC’s account simply could not hold up to Mr Goh HC’s unequivocal denial that the trades carried out in all his accounts did not belong to him. For Mr Kuan AM’s two accounts, the First Accused claimed that he had paid “particular attention” to these accounts – by providing guidance and advice to help Mr Kuan AM earn money – because Mr Kuan AM’s brother, one Mr Steven Kuan, had helped him in his younger days. After Mr Steven Kuan passed away in an accident, the First Accused said that he had felt the need to repay the debt of gratitude.

 380 I could accept the backstory put forward by the First Accused. However, I was unable to understand how this gelled with the actual relationship the First Accused had with Mr Jack Ng. If the First Accused had agreed to help Mr Kuan AM in this way, it would have been a straightforward matter for Mr Kuan AM to inform Mr Jack Ng who the First Accused was, and that he should take stock tips from him when he called. This was not what transpired. Indeed, on Mr Jack Ng’s evidence, the First Accused pretended to be “Peter Chew” and Mr Jack Ng did not even have knowledge of the fact that he had been talking to the John Soh until after the Crash when they had met at LionGold’s office (see [376] above). 381 Furthermore, the First Accused’s account in court was also wholly inconsistent with the information he had given the CAD. In a statement recorded by the CAD on 19 November 2014, two questions relating to Mr Kuan AM and his trading activities were asked of the First Accused, and he gave the following answers:

Question 1004: What do you know about Kuan Ah Ming’s trading activities?Answer: Nothing. I don’t think I even had promoted LionGold or Blumont shares to him unless he was part of some big group I was promoting to, like at some dinner for instance.Question 1005: What is your involvement in Kuan Ah Ming’s trading activities?Answer: No involvement.…Question 1097: Do you know Kuan Ah Ming?Answer: I know Kuan Ah Ming distantly from his late brother.Question 1098: Given that you know Kuan Ah Ming, and an order was placed from your phone for Kuan Ah Ming’s account, it would appear that you had placed the order for Kuan Ah Ming’s account. Isn’t that the case?Answer: That is not the case. I have not been in touch with Kuan Ah Ming over the last few years and don’t even have his telephone number and don’t think he has mine either. I didn’t know till now he has any business dealings with Jack [Ng].382 When cross-examined about the difference between his account in court and the foregoing answers, the First Accused stated that he had interpreted the CAD’s questions as referring to whether he had given trading instructions for Mr Kuan AM’s accounts.

 As regards the sharper contradiction resulting from his response to the CAD that he did not even know Mr Kuan AM had dealings with Mr Jack Ng, the First Accused admitted that his positions were not consistent but stated that the inconsistency had arisen because the CAD’s questions had been coming at him in a “fast and furious” manner.

 None of these explanations were even remotely credible and it was readily apparent that the First Accused’s account in court was a fabrication designed to refute the Prosecution’s case at an extraordinarily granular level. 383 I should note that the First Accused also attempted to bolster his position by attacking the credibility of Mr Jack Ng. He averred that Mr Jack Ng had committed his own wrongs by taking unauthorised instructions from Ms Ang and, thus, that he “had [the] motive to incriminate the accused persons, so as to redirect the authorities’ attention and conceal his own wrongdoing”.

 I found this argument difficult to understand. The essence of the First Accused’s submission appeared to be that Mr Jack Ng had hidden the fact that he had taken unauthorised instructions from Ms Ang by informing the authorities that he had taken unauthorised instructions from the accused persons. This was wholly illogical. Indeed, even if Mr Jack Ng had committed some wrongdoing, that did not in itself suggest that everything he had said in evidence ought to be automatically discounted as untruths. At least some particularity was needed in this regard. The First Accused’s submission had none, and there was therefore nothing I could make of this contention. 384 In the round, I accepted Mr Jack Ng’s evidence that these six accounts under his management had been under the accused persons’ control. (11) Two accounts under Mr Aaron Ong385 This subgroup within Group 1 comprised two Relevant Accounts held with OCBC Securities under the management of TR Mr Aaron Ong.

 However, I need not reproduce them as they each illustrated the same point that the messages exchanged between the First Accused and Mr Hong were plainly not in the nature of the former giving the latter trading advice.

 Both Mr Ong KC and Mr Lim TL testified, and the evidence of Mr Chen was – additionally – relevant in respect of his own account. 389 As mentioned at [41] above, Mr Ong KC and the First Accused were long-time associates. They had known each other since the early 1990s. Equally, the accounts under his management were also relatively old accounts, each having been opened between 2000 and 2003. For each of these three accounts, Mr Ong KC gave clear evidence that, during the Relevant Period, the First Accused had been the one giving trading instructions.

 Practically, Mr Ong KC testified that he had typically received instructions from the First Accused via one of two mobile phone lines.

 as was Mr Chen’s testimony in respect of his own account.390 Mr Ong KC’s position was supported by the GovTech Evidence which showed that, for the accounts of Mr Chen, Magnus Energy and Mr Tan BK respectively, 87%, 50% and 81.9% the BAL orders entered during the Relevant Period had been preceded by proximate communications between the First Accused and Mr Ong KC.

 These, however, were essentially bare assertions which carried little to no weight.

Whilst the First Accused was being cross-examined on the high percentage of BAL orders that preceded by calls between himself and Mr Kam, the First Accused denied that those orders had been triggered by the calls.

Answer (the First Accused): Okay. Your Honour, firstly the broker. Ong Kah Chye is a 50-year-old veteran even at that time. He -- he was the CEO of Alliance Securities. He knows jolly well what can be done and what ought not to be done. Number two, he’s a very close friend of Peter Chen, and Peter, from time to time, goes out with him socialising and so on and so forth. I know him since 1991/1992, but I don’t socialise with him. Peter, in his own evidence, have said he calls Ong Kah Chye, he gives direct instructions to Ong Kah Chye, and there are a few times when he told Ong Kah Chye, if he’s not around, I might call on his behalf, but that would have been rare. Along those lines. But he’s always insisted he give direct instructions.Now, the reason for this high percentage, there are many, but the reasons are along this line. Firstly, my calls with Ong Kah Chye’s two phones, I think it’s 700 to 800 calls over the material period, okay. There are a lot of reasons: he brought me a lot of HNIs, he brought me a lot of people to talk to, and we talked to each other on -- over the market, because I’ve come to use him as one of the barometers of market feedback. Okay.Now, along the line, he would have asked me -- of course he would have asked me what is my -- what is my thoughts on the present situation, BAL. I will give him my two cents’ worth. How he translate it to Peter’s trades is totally not in my control. He would have never accepted my instructions, because he’s an old hand, and, if you look at Peter’s instructions, your Honour, you would find that Peter has said that Ong Kah Chye prefers Peter to call him over the landline.So on this particular case, it’s definitely a no-no. I would not have given instructions on this case. Peter would have called him direct, Peter would have called him over the landline, over his other phones. Peter would have made arrangement with him. They are much closer to each other than to me.393 The First Accused’s explanation was unbelievable. The telecommunications data showed that the First Accused had called Mr Ong KC 145 times during the entire Relevant Period

 It stretched logic to think that the First Accused would have needed to communicate with Mr Ong KC with such frequency to obtain “market feedback” and hear “thoughts on BAL”. However, when this explanation was applied to the apparent referrals of high net-worth individuals to the First Accused, all sense of reality appeared to break down. It simply beggared belief to think that Mr Ong KC had such a constant and substantial number of wealthy individuals to introduce to the First Accused regularly.394 Second, the First Accused submitted that since the Relevant Accounts under Mr Ong KC’s management had been opened in the early 2000s, they “did not fit the bill of accounts that were opened pursuant to a conspiracy between the accused persons”.

 I did not understand this. A conspiracy or conspiracies could plainly have formed around an account even if the account had not been opened in connection with any conspiracy. 395 Third, the First Accused referred to an answer given by Mr Chen to the CAD during an interview. Essentially, Mr Chen’s answer suggested two things: (a) that Mr Ong KC as an “old-school” TR preferred to receive trading instructions via his landline; and (b) that he (ie, Mr Chen) may have given discretionary trading powers to Mr Ong KC.

 396 I did not agree. (a) In respect of (a), though Mr Chen did suggest that Mr Ong KC preferred to receive trading instructions by his landline, Mr Chen also stated that he “did not pay special attention since [he] did not differentiate [Mr Ong KC’s] office line from [Mr Ong KC’s] mobile line when [he] saved them in [his] mobile contact list”.

 This being so, the First Accused’s implied contention that the GovTech Evidence may not have captured instructions given by Mr Chen to Mr Ong KC via the latter’s landline was weak at best. (b) Next, as regards (b), Mr Chen explained at trial that when he had given this answer to the CAD, he “thought” that he had signed a document which had given Mr Ong KC discretionary powers to trade on his behalf. However, he was mistaken as no such document had been signed.

 Without this document, the implicit suggestion the First Accused was seeking to make – that Mr Ong KC may have been the one in control of Mr Chen’s account – fell away. 397 Fourth, the First Accused referred to: (a) Mr Ong KC’s statement during the trial that he had not given trade reports to the First Accused;

 I did not find either point persuasive. In respect of the former, the First Accused failed to take into consideration Mr Ong KC’s very reasonable explanation that he had not provided trade reports because trades were often executed immediately before their calls ended and, in any event, Mr Ong KC had formed the impression that the First Accused was keeping track of the status of the orders himself.

 As to the latter, the existence of two Clear Days – in the face of the high hit rate revealed by the GovTech Evidence (see [390] above) – was not probative.398 Overall, I found that there was enough evidence to conclude that these three accounts had been within the First Accused’s control and, for the reasons stated at [508]–[517] below, such control was probably exercised in connection with some broader scheme. I did not accept any of the First Accused’s contentions that the accounts were not or could not have been within his control.(13) Six accounts under Ms Poon399 The next subgroup within Group 1 comprised six Relevant Accounts held with OCBC Securities, managed by TR Ms Poon.

 The First Accused was not said to have been directly involved in the use of these accounts. None of the six Relevant Accountholders were called to give evidence. Therefore, the only witness whose evidence was directly relevant to the accused persons’ alleged control of these accounts was Ms Poon. 400 In that connection, the starting point was Ms Poon’s evidence that she was not the original TR for these accounts, which had been opened between 2003 and 2005. The original TR for these accounts, instead, was Ms Tracy Ooi. As stated at various points above (see, eg, [212] and [277]), Ms Tracy Ooi was a “bank officer” with UOB who had some association with Mr Chen, Ms Ung, Ms Ang, and the First Accused. However, the specific details of their association, and how she was known to the accused persons, were not wholly fleshed out. That said, those details were not entirely lacking. This was because Ms Poon gave clear evidence as to her association with Ms Tracy Ooi, how she came to take over as the TR for the six Relevant Accounts, and what Ms Tracy Ooi had told her about the way those accounts would be operated. Given the importance of Ms Tracy Ooi in this equation, it is important to consider Ms Poon’s description of these events as set out in her conditioned statement:

I was not the original TR for these accounts. They were pre-existing accounts opened under different TRs and transferred to me subsequently. A person named “Tracy Ooi” (“Tracy”) arranged for the accounts to be transferred to me. I do not know any of the six account holders personally. Apart from [Dato Idris], whom I met briefly when he came to the OCBC office to sign a form, I have never met any of the account holders, nor have I spoken to them on the phone before.… I was introduced to Tracy sometime in late 2011 by Margaret Tan (“Margaret”) who was my friend and ex-colleague at [Kim Eng Securities]. …I met Tracy for the first time while having lunch with Margaret. It was not a planned meeting. Margaret and I just happened to meet Tracy then. Margaret introduced Tracy and me to each other. Margaret said that Tracy was her ex-colleague and that Tracy was currently servicing margin accounts in UOB. Tracy stayed for a while to chat with us and asked us how business was. While chatting, Tracy could have learnt that I worked at OCBC.The second time I met Tracy was when I ran into her at the OCBC office. This was shortly after our first meeting. …The third time I met Tracy was when we arranged to meet for coffee about a few weeks after the second meeting. Tracy initiated the meeting. I think Tracy called me on my office line. During the call, Tracy asked whether I was interested in taking over as the remisier for some existing accounts at OCBC. We met at a cafe near the OCBC office to discuss further.When we met, Tracy asked me if I wanted to take over some existing accounts at OCBC. Tracy said that these were “nominee accounts” and there would be a cash account and a margin account for each account holder. Tracy said that a person called “Quah Su Ling” (“QSL”) would give the trading instructions for these accounts. Tracy told me they were “good accounts” because the losses were settled promptly by QSL. Tracy said that QSL did not like the existing remisiers as they were not quick in answering her calls. I inferred that QSL was giving the trading instructions for these accounts previously. As for the margin accounts, Tracy said there were shares parked there but the accounts would not be used to trade. I was of the impression that the shares could be used as collateral for the cash account in the event that the trading limit of the cash account needed to be increased or if there were losses.I agreed to accept the nominee accounts during the meeting with Tracy. I agreed because I wanted business and to earn commissions on the trades. I also believed Tracy that these were low risk accounts. Tracy arranged for the transfer forms to be completed by the account holders and handed to me. The accounts were not transferred to me all at once. Instead Tracy handed me a few transfer forms at a time.I did not meet any of the nominees when their accounts were transferred to me except for [Dato Idris]. Tracy or QSL arranged for [Dato Idris] to come to the OCBC office once for the purpose of signing a letter authorising me to collect cheques on [Dato Idris’] behalf.

 This is the letter of authorisation [Dato Idris] signed at the OCBC office when I met him. I did not ask [Dato Idris] whether QSL was authorised to trade in his account. We met for a short time and the purpose was to get him to sign the authorisation letter.For the other nominees, Tracy handed me the authorisation letters that were already signed by them.

 These are the authorisation letters for the other five nominees which Tracy handed to me.When I took over the nominee accounts, I knew that there was no written third party authorisation given for QSL to trade in the accounts. However, I was more concerned about whether the accounts would give me problems in terms of non-payment or late payment. I felt that there was little risk in executing QSL’s trades as this was a continuation of the arrangement with the previous remisiers. I also made a check with OCBC’s credit department which confirmed what Tracy said about the accounts never being delinquent or late in payment.After I took over the accounts, I noticed that there were [Blumont], [Asiasons] and/or [LionGold] shares parked in each of the margin accounts. Tracy told me that the nominees also had margin accounts at UOB. I took it that Tracy was servicing these margin accounts. Tracy mentioned that the shares in the UOB margin accounts were transferred to OCBC because the nominees’ margin accounts at UOB were already full and could not be used to buy more shares.401 As set out above, Ms Tracy Ooi informed Ms Poon that these were nominee accounts run by the Second Accused, who would give instructions and settle losses. Thus, the Second Accused was the one who had given trading instructions for these six accounts, not the accountholders.

 This was consistent with the Accused Persons’ Analysis, which showed that between 78% and 92.6% of the BAL orders entered in the accounts during the he Relevant Period had been preceded by communications between the Second Accused and Ms Poon.

 In this connection, Ms Poon also gave evidence that she had received cheques from the Second Accused’s staff, Mr Jumaat and Mr Najib (also see [377(c)] above). (c) Finally, these accounts traded almost exclusively in BAL shares and nothing else. The accounts of Mr Sim CK, Ms Chong, Ms Hairani and Mr Ngu traded only in BAL shares over the entire Relevant Period, and these trades were of substantial value. Respectively, these accounts traded S$14,461,313, S$11,338,176, S$20,503,436, and S$20,581,261 in worth of BAL shares. The accounts of Dato Idris and Mr Lee SK were not far behind. BAL trades represented 99.48% and 95.85% of their total trading activity, and these percentages represented S$32,870,421 and S$17,084,006 in worth of BAL shares traded.

403 In response to the foregoing, the Defence sought to undermine the veracity of Ms Poon’s evidence. First, as with Mr Ong KC (see [397] above) they submitted that there were three Clear Days, and that no trade reporting had been carried out by Ms Poon despite her claim she “always provide[d] trade confirmations”.

 Second, they suggested that Ms Tracy Ooi possibly “had a hand” in using these accounts since she had been the one who arranged for them to be transferred to Ms Poon in the first place.

 404 I did not accept any of these explanations. In relation to the apparent absence of trade reporting, I will explain from [736]–[743] below that any gaps in the TRs’ trade reporting did not carry as much exculpatory value as the accused persons suggested. As regards the allegation that Ms Tracy Ooi may have controlled the account, there was nothing which I could reasonably make of the bare allegation.405 It is meaningful, however, to engage the Clear Days Argument in a little more detail. The argument as I understood it, applied here specifically to the context of Ms Poon, proceeded as follows. One, Ms Poon testified that only the Second Accused had given trading instructions in respect of these six Relevant Accounts. Two, the GovTech Evidence (the Accused Persons’ Analysis specifically) accorded a fairly long five-minute window for Ms Poon to place an order pursuant to the Second Accused’s supposed instructions. Three, this window of time should therefore have captured most, if not all, of the trades that had been preceded by communications between the Second Accused and Ms Poon. Four, despite the foregoing, there were Clear Days when trades had been executed without any communications with the Second Accused. Five, I should observe that for the whole Relevant Period, the percentage of trades preceded by communications from the Second Accused dropped as low as 78% for Ms Hairani’s account.

 The question which arose then was why 22% of the BAL orders entered in that account – supposedly instructed by the Second Accused – had not been entered within five minutes of her alleged calls.406 The inference which the Defence wished for me to draw from these matters was that Ms Poon was lying, and that her entire account of the facts ought to be disregarded. I appreciated that this argument carried intuitive appeal. It cast some doubt on Ms Poon’s firm statements that only the Second Accused had given her instructions. However, what it did not do was demonstrate that Ms Poon’s basic account – that the Second Accused would call to instruct her, and that she would act on those instructions – was untrue.407 It could not be doubted that the GovTech Evidence was not and did not purport to be a perfect representation of the truth of the underlying facts. The data needed to be examined alongside the primary evidence of witnesses and the objective documentary records to determine whether certain facts had been proven. The data was but an accompanying instrument playing its part. Thus, the manner in which the Defence sought to utilise the data in argument, though intuitively appealing, was not as potent as they seemed to believe. The existence of Clear Days did not, as the Defence suggested, meet Ms Poon’s evidence at the level so as to rob her entire account of the facts of any and all credibility.408 Indeed, as stated at [120] above, the GovTech Evidence was only corroborative evidence, and small gaps in this category of evidence did not detract from Ms Poon’s basic account that the Second Accused had been the one who gave trading instructions in respect of these six accounts. I appreciated that it was not for the First Accused to give evidence for the Second Accused. However, these six accountholders were his associates from Malaysia, or at least connected to his associates, and he did not provide an explanation as to how the Second Accused might have been connected to them. This left me with Ms Poon’s account of the facts, no rebuttal from the Second Accused, and not even an explanation as to what legitimate purpose the Second Accused might have had for contacting Ms Poon in respect of these accounts. The inference to be drawn from this set of facts was self-evident. Thus, on all the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Second Accused had exercised control over these six Relevant Accounts.(14) Account under Mr See409 As far as Group 1 was concerned, Mr See was the TR for just one Relevant Account held with Lim & Tan – that of Annica Holdings, a company controlled by Mr Sugiarto. The Prosecution’s case in respect of this account was somewhat muddy. At the end of the trial, the position taken was that only the First Accused had exercised control over the account by relaying instructions to Mr See through Mr Sugiarto.

 In its written closing submissions, however, the Prosecution stated that – in respect of orders for LionGold shares – it was “primarily” the Second Accused who had relayed trading instructions to Mr See through Mr Sugiarto.

 This inconsistency was unsatisfactory, particularly given that the Prosecution would have been well aware of the Defence’s clear and persistent complaint that the False Trading, Price Manipulation and Deception Charges did not contain sufficient particulars (see [180]–[190] above and [948]–[957] below). In a case as voluminous yet as granular as this was, it was incumbent on the Prosecution to ensure that its positions were clear. 410 That being said, as the specific way the Relevant Accounts had allegedly been controlled and used only constituted the Prosecution’s evidential case (see [182] above), it was not appropriate to disregard the position taken by the Prosecution in its closing submissions on the basis that it was not identical to that taken at the end of the trial. The question was whether there was something which ought to have precluded the Prosecution from so relying on this position. In answering this, the central consideration was, of course, whether the accused persons would have been prejudiced. 411 In my judgment, the answer was ‘no’. In the course of giving evidence, the First Accused had ample opportunity to address the allegation against him that he had relayed BAL trading instructions to Mr See through Mr Sugiarto. The Second Accused did not have this opportunity, but that was a consequence of her election not to give evidence in her defence. Accordingly, even if the Prosecution had properly put its final position (ie, that taken in its closing submissions) to the First Accused towards the end of the trial, that would not have changed the development of the Second Accused’s defence. It would not have affected her election, which was made on far broader grounds,

 and, thus, her defence would still have had to be established by submissions on and characterisation of the evidence that had come in. The Second Accused would have been able to address this point in her written submissions, particularly given the fact that the Prosecution and First Accused had tendered their written submissions first, and the Second Accused had been given additional time to put in hers after considering their arguments. 412 On this footing, I turn to the evidence in respect of the Prosecution’s case that both accused persons had exercised control over Annica Holdings’ account by relaying instructions to Mr See through Mr Sugiarto. As stated at [146] above, Mr Sugiarto was unable to testify due to illness, and, as such, the only relevant witness for the Prosecution was Mr See. 413 Mr See’s evidence was that he had received instructions only from Mr Sugiarto, and not either of the accused persons.

 The first step was to identify whether there had been orders entered by the TR within a five-minute window of telecommunications between the person apparently relaying the trading instructions (the “relayer”), and the TR. The second step was to identify whether there had been any telecommunications between the accused persons and the relayer, within a five-minute window of the start times of the telecommunications between the relayer and the TR. 414 In respect of Annica Holdings’ account with Lim & Tan, some examples of such “relaying”, covering all three counters were:(a) On 1 August 2012, at 11.20am (that is, between 11.20.00am and 11.20.59am because the exact second is not known),

 Thus, in total, there were around 130 instances on which the BAL trades placed in Annica Holdings’ Lim & Tan account had been preceded by communications between the accused persons and Mr Sugiarto. 416 This was very telling. Had the hit rate been high, but the absolute number of instances been low, I would probably have taken the opposite view. After all, the lower the absolute number, the more easily they could have been explained as pure coincidences. However, in my judgment, 130 instances simply could not be explained in that way.417 In fact, 130 was the least number of instances. This was because, as alluded to at [414(a)] above, some of SingTel’s telecommunications data did not record the exact second of calls.

 Thus, where a call between either accused persons and Mr Sugiarto ended on the same minute the call between Mr Sugiarto and Mr See commenced, it could not be determined which call preceded which. Given that the premise of the Relaying Analysis was that the accused persons’ communication with Mr Sugiarto had to take place before Mr Sugiarto’s communication with Mr See, 76 potential instances of relaying had to be discounted from the analysis. That said, I was nevertheless mindful that the true number was technically an unknown: ≥ 130 but ≤ 206. As such, given that 130 was itself too many instances to have been explained by pure coincidence, so long as the rate of error caused by the limitation in SingTel’s data was anything less than 100% of 76 instances, my conclusion did not only stand, it was also bolstered. 418 I was conscious that it was not very forensically satisfactory to have had to assess the evidence in this manner without Mr Sugiarto’s testimony. However, I did not think that I was ultimately hamstrung from reaching the conclusion I did as a result of his absence. The inference to which the Relaying Analysis gave rise was, by itself, already strong. However, beyond that, it was additionally supported by two points. (a) First, an email had been sent by the Second Accused to the First Accused on 29 January 2012, prior to the Relevant Period. In this email, the Second Accused listed many trades carried out in various accounts or in unnamed accounts held with various TRs. This included Annica Holdings’ Lim & Tan account. The salient portions of the email were:

When considered alongside the evidence of TRs who testified that the accused persons generally instructed them to roll-over BAL trades (see, eg, Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence at [338(a)]), this email loosely suggested that these had likely been the accounts within the accused persons’ sphere of influence if not their direct field of control. In turn, the fact that the account was on this list lent clear context which supported the inference of control drawn from the Relaying Analysis.(b) Second, the exercise of control through a relayer was not peculiar to this account. It was consistent with the manner in which certain other accounts had been controlled (eg, the accounts of Mr James Hong under the management of TRs Ms Jenny Lim and Mr Aaron Ong in respect of which direct records of text messages showed that the First Accused had exercised control by relaying instructions through Mr Hong: see [357]–[373] and [385]–[387] above). This in turn minimised the likelihood that my inference was erroneous. 419 Thus, on these premises, I was satisfied that the accused persons had controlled Annica Holdings’ account with Lim & Tan. For completeness, however, I should add two points. (a) First, the accused persons did not have a substantive response to the Prosecution’s case in respect of this account. Relying on Mr See’s evidence that he had only taken instructions from Mr Sugiarto, and not them, the accused persons contended that they had not been involved in the use of the account at all and that there was nothing to suggest otherwise.

 This entirely ignored the Relaying Analysis and other evidence discussed above, which, as stated, I found persuasive. (b) Second, in support of its case, the Prosecution also sought to rely on the fact that the Shareholding Schedule had kept track of some shares owned by Annica Holdings.

 It did not keep track of Annica Holdings’ account with Lim & Tan specifically. As I will explain from [744]–[750] below, the Shareholding Schedule generally went towards the broader inquiry into whether the accused persons’ alleged Scheme existed. It is only where a Relevant Account featured in the Schedule that its specific presence also went towards the narrower question whether individual Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons. Without such specificity, in my view, the contents of the Shareholding Schedule did not establish a tight analytical connection between a particular account, and the accused persons’ alleged control of that account.(15) Account under Ms Tian420 This subgroup within Group 1 comprised just one account held by Ms Cheng with CIMB. It was the Prosecution’s case that the First Accused had only given instructions to Ms Cheng.

However, she specifically denied that the same could be said of her CIMB account (as well as her personal Credit Suisse account to which I will return at [600] below).

 The particularity of her denial suggested that Ms Cheng was being truthful. Indeed, the accounts held by Alethia Elite engaged in far more BAL trades than her CIMB account. Having admitted the former, there was no cogent reason for her to lie about the latter.424 The only specific evidence on which the Prosecution relied to contradict Ms Cheng’s testimony, was an exchange she had with the First Accused on 2 October 2013 by text message:

Remember you have proceeds from the 200 lots you sold wronglyFirst Accused (2 Oct 2013, 4.56pm): Ok.

Buy 1st then nx week re-position ok?As an aside, I note that these four messages were all that the TCFB were able to extract from Ms Cheng’s Blackberry device. Given the First Accused’s message at 4.56pm, which appeared to be a response and follow-up, it was likely that there were communications which interposed these. 425 When Ms Cheng was examined about the First Accused’s reference to her “personal line”, she explained that the “200 lots” to which he was referring, were shares which he had lent her because she had erroneously oversold more shares than she had. The borrowed shares were therefore needed to cover her short position.

 If she had indeed made her CIMB account available to the accused persons, and had been asked by the First Accused to use any account – including her CIMB account – to pick up as many Blumont shares as she could in the face of the falling market, there would have been no reason for her to admit the involvement of some but not all Relevant Accounts.427 Accordingly, relying primarily on Ms Cheng’s candour about the other accounts under her management and, without anything more to contradict her evidence, I rejected the Prosecution’s submission that the accused persons had control over Ms Cheng’s CIMB account. Such a finding would have gone against Ms Cheng’s evidence on this point, which I had no reason to doubt, and would not even have been supported by other objective evidence. In fact, I should add that pushing for this finding in the face of the stark lack of evidence did little more than to devalue the notion of “control”. If I had found that the tenuous evidence on which the Prosecution relied was sufficient to demonstrate the accused persons’ control of Ms Cheng’s CIMB account, that would have weakened the force of my findings in respect of the other Relevant Accounts.

 Accordingly, the broader purpose of the Prosecution’s impeachment application was not simply to invite the court to disregard everything Mr Tiong had said on the stand; and, obviously, their objective was not to substitute Mr Tiong’s testimony in court with the statements he had given the CAD (which were even less favourable to their case). Instead, the purpose of their application was to persuade me that certain aspects of Mr Tiong’s evidence in court ought not to be believed, and that the true position was to be derived from other aspects of his testimony read with the objective evidence.

430 Before turning to what Mr Tiong had told the CAD, what he had said in court, and what I made of the Prosecution’s impeachment application, it is useful to state that the Defence’s case in respect of these two Relevant Accounts was limited. It focused entirely on the contention that the Second Accused had not been the sole user of the 6861 number.

 However, as I have stated at [198(c)] and [211]–[216] above, I did not accept this, and I found that the Second Accused was the sole user of the 6861 number. Given this, the issue which needed to be addressed was simply whether the Prosecution had even adduced enough evidence to support the conclusion that the Second Accused had controlled the two accounts under Mr Tiong. 431 I found that they had. My analysis was as follows. As the TR for the two Relevant Accounts in issue, there were two material points on which Mr Tiong’s evidence was crucial: (a) who had given trading instruction for Mr Richard Ooi’s two accounts; and (b) if anyone other than Mr Richard Ooi had done so, whether those individuals had been authorised, be it formally or informally, to do so. In Mr Tiong’s CAD statements, he stated in no uncertain terms that only Mr Richard Ooi had given him trading instructions. Thus, point (b) did not even arise. Saliently, in response to the following questions posed by the CAD, Mr Tiong answered:

Question 58: Did any person(s), other than Ooi, ever give you any trade instructions for the PSPL trading accounts?Answer: No one.…Question 60: Was there anyone else that you would also inform of, for Ooi’s trade confirmations and trade reports of the PSPL trading accounts?Answer: No.…Question 61: How did Ooi make payments for his losses?Answer: Usually Ooi would pay one or two days after the losses were realised. I did not have to chase him. I do not know how he paid up. There are funds in his other accounts, so the losses can be deducted from them. But I would not touch these funds unless he gave special instructions. He usually wins money though.…Question 74: Can I confirm that Ooi was the only person to call you to place trades in his account?Answer: Yes.…Question 274: Since you received calls from the number “60197726861” shortly before you placed trades in Ooi’s and Chong’s accounts, could they be placing trades in each other’s accounts?Answer: No, they have only been placing trades in their own accounts.…Question 290: I refer you to Question 274 of your previous statement taken on 22 December 2014. Can you confirm that Chong and Ooi only placed trades in their respective accounts?Answer: Yes.…Question 319: [Interviewer referred Mr Tiong to his call records from 1 March 2013 to 31 October 2013] Can you check the exhibits and tell me how many Malaysian numbers did you make calls to?Answer: I only see one number, 60197726861.…Question 320: Given that you have two Malaysian clients, why is it that you can only locate one Malaysian number based on your call records spanning over 8 months?Answer: It could be possible that some of the calls were not reflected in the exhibits or it could be that either Ooi or Chong used a Singapore number to call me.…Question 323: Given that 60197726861 is the main Malaysian number you contacted (or vice versa), is it the case where there was only one person giving trade instructions for both Ooi’s and Chong’s accounts?Answer: That is not the case. They called for their respective accounts.432 For context, I should highlight that the “Chong” to whom Mr Tiong referred in his answers was Ms Chong. She held three accounts with Phillip Securities under Mr Tiong’s management (one cash account, one investment account, and one share financing account);

 however, they were not Relevant Accounts. They were therefore only germane to the extent they featured in Mr Tiong’s CAD statements and testimony. 433 In court, Mr Tiong radically departed from the position he had taken in his CAD statements. Before getting to the critical points of departure, however, it is necessary to provide some more context. Mr Tiong was not the original TR for the accounts of Mr Richard Ooi and Ms Chong. Sometime in January 2012, Mr Wong XY had arranged a meeting which Mr Tiong, Mr Wong XY and the Second Accused attended. Mr Wong XY and Mr Tiong met when the former was a TR in Phillip Securities and the two were friends.

 The purpose of the meeting was for Mr Wong XY to introduce Mr Tiong to the Second Accused because she, in turn, had clients to introduce to Mr Tiong. Those clients were Mr Richard Ooi and Ms Chong and they needed a new TR because the previous TR for their accounts (this individual’s identity was irrelevant) had left Phillip Securities.

 434 Four points about this introduction and the transfer of the accounts were crucial. First, Mr Tiong stated that neither Mr Richard Ooi nor Ms Chong had attended the meeting. Second, when asked why the Second Accused had been involved in the meeting given that the accounts did not belong to her, all Mr Tiong could say was: “[s]he said it was her friend’s account” [sic]. When asked to explain why the Second Accused had been involved in her friends’ accounts, Mr Tiong said: “I don’t know; I didn’t ask”. Third, Mr Tiong stated that he had never met Mr Richard Ooi and Ms Chong in person, whether before or after the transfer. Fourth, when asked why they would have agreed to transfer their accounts to him, a stranger, Mr Tiong did not provide any explanation beyond the fact that the Second Accused would have endorsed him, and this was, in turn, based on Mr Wong XY’s recommendation.

Introduction of Joe Tiong to QSLSometime in 2012, [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] called me to ask if I knew any remisiers in Phillip Securities who could take over some trading accounts. She did not mention what accounts these were. I thought of Joe Tiong (“JT”) (full name Tiong Sing Fatt) who I knew from my time at Phillip Securities. I knew that JT had recently converted to being a remisier, and his business was not good at the time. I asked JT whether he was interested in taking over some accounts, and told him that the client’s (ie QSL) trades were quite big at times. I do not recall whether I mentioned QSL’s name in my conversation with JT. JT said he didn’t mind taking over the accounts. I then informed QSL that I had a friend called “Joe” who could be trusted and was eager for business. I set up a meeting where I introduced JT to QSL. JT then started helping QSL to execute trades in the accounts.[emphasis added in bold italics]436 This brings me to the critical points of departure Mr Tiong made at trial from the positions he had taken in his CAD statements. There were three.(a) First, contrary to his claim that Mr Richard Ooi had been the only one to give trading instructions for his own accounts (see [431] above), Mr Tiong admitted that he had in fact taken trading instructions for those accounts from a female caller who had used a Malaysian number. There was no dispute at trial that this was the 6861 number.

 The way this supposedly came about was as follows. Mr Tiong stated that, after Mr Richard Ooi and Ms Chong’s accounts had been transferred to him, neither had used the phone numbers on Phillip Securities’ record to contact him.

 Instead, they had both used the 6861 number to do so. Initially, Mr Tiong claimed, both accountholders would give him trading instructions in respect of their own accounts using this number by passing the phone between each other. And, when they called him with the 6861 number, he would verify their identities before taking their instructions. Subsequently, however, Mr Tiong said that he “got lazy” and did not carry out any verification when he received calls from this number. Mr Richard Ooi also eventually stopped contacting him, and it was only Ms Chong who had used that number to place trades in both her own and Mr Richard Ooi’s accounts.

(b) Second, contrary to the position Mr Tiong had taken in his CAD statements that he had not provided reports of the trades executed in Mr Richard Ooi’s accounts to anyone other than Mr Richard Ooi himself, Mr Tiong admitted in court that he had sent such reports to the 6861 number, which – even on his own account – had primarily been used by Ms Chong, and not Mr Richard Ooi.

On occasions where there were losses to be settled, the female caller would contact Mr Tiong to inform him that arrangements would be made for someone to deliver payment. Thereafter, a runner named “Jumaat” would deliver an envelope containing cash to cover the losses. Mr Tiong also recalled a man other than “Jumaat” who delivered such payments, though he could not recall his name.

 and all Mr Tiong could offer in response was the patently feeble explanation that he had “assumed” Mr Richard Ooi had been present next to Ms Chong when the latter gave him trading instructions using the 6861 number. He was unable to explain the basis of his assumption, much less why he had not informed the CAD about such an assumption.

 Thus, I regarded the contradictions as unexplained and the question which arose was what to make of the differences. This brings me then to the second part of my analysis.438 Chiefly, the Prosecution relied on eight strands of evidence in support of its case that the Second Accused had exercised control over Mr Richard Ooi’s accounts by giving direct trading instructions to Mr Tiong, contrary both to the position Mr Tiong had taken in his CAD statement that Mr Richard Ooi had given his own instructions, and the position he took at trial that Ms Chong had been the one to do so. (a) First and foremost, the evidence which showed that the Second Accused had been the sole user of the 6861 number. As stated at [430] above, I found that she had been.(b) Second, the Authorised Persons’ Analysis which showed that no proximate communications between Mr Richard Ooi and Mr Tiong had preceded BAL trades entered in the former’s accounts.

 (c) Third, the Prosecution submitted that the timing of specific calls and trade orders also supported the inference that the communications Mr Tiong had with the Second Accused concerned the placement of BAL orders in Mr Richard Ooi’s accounts. For example, on 27 February 2013, at 4.41.25pm, Mr Tiong had called the 6861 number and this lasted just three seconds.

 the Prosecution hypothesised that what had likely happened was this: Mr Tiong first called the Second Accused on the 6861 number, and when she answered, she had informed him that she was in Singapore and directed him to contact her local number (potentially to save on roaming charges). According to the Prosecution, this explained why the first call only lasted three seconds, but the second lasted fourteen.

Moreover, Mr Wong XY also testified that, in the evening of Sunday 6 October 2013 (before the SGX had lifted the suspension: see [16]–[17] above), he and Mr Tiong had gone to LionGold’s office together to speak to the accused persons. According to Mr Wong XY, at their meeting, the First Accused told him and Mr Tiong “not to panic” and that the “worst case scenario was that Blumont would open [when trading resumed on 7 October 2013] at $0.50”. The First Accused also told them to “toe the line” and “not to panic sell and dump”.

 Several points about this event were noteworthy. One, as a director, Mr Tiong had been paid a monthly salary of S$4,000 at a time when he needed funds to repay the losses suffered as a result of the Crash.

 Three, by Mr Tiong’s own admission, the First Accused had made the arrangements for him to be appointed a director of the company at a time when they were practically strangers, when he had not yet done nothing for the First Accused, nor had he promised the First Accused anything in return.

 Four, according to Mr Gan, the company had been renamed “Dongshan” as a play on the Chinese idiom “东山再起” (dōng shān zài qǐ) because the First Accused had intended to use the company to make a comeback after the Crash. By “comeback”, Mr Gan specifically meant this: “if we were to look at Mr Soh’s past modus operandi, it would be to make this [into] another sexy story [and] pump up the share price”. This plan, however, did not come to fruition before the First Accused had been arrested in 2016. On these premises, the Prosecution submitted that Mr Tiong’s explanation was unbelievable, and that the only logical explanation for his appointment in Dongshan, was that the two had some pre-existing relationship which warranted the First Accused helping Mr Tiong after the Crash. This relationship, the Prosecution said, must have arisen from the accused persons’ control of the two Relevant Accounts under Mr Tiong’s management.

439 This brings me to the third and final part of my analysis – what to make of Mr Tiong’s contradictory positions and the strands of evidence relied on by the Prosecution. In my judgment, the answer was clear and may be expressed as three conclusions.440 First, Mr Tiong’s credit was certainly impeached. He had lied to the CAD over several interviews – this was obvious from the stark and unexplained contradictions between his CAD statements and his evidence in court. The account Mr Tiong had given to the CAD was, therefore, not to be believed.441 Second, Mr Tiong remained undesirous of disclosing the whole truth in court. This was particularly evident from three positions he adamantly stood by. The first was his lack of any cogent explanation as to why the Second Accused had been involved in the transfer of Mr Richard Ooi and Ms Chong’s accounts to his management. The second was his unsustainable claim that Ms Chong had been the user of the 6861 number. The third was Mr Tiong’s unbelievable assertion that the First Accused had arranged for him to be appointed a director of Dongshan for, seemingly, no reason. These points led firmly to the conclusion that Mr Tiong was seeking to conceal aspects of the truth, though there were elements of his testimony that were probably true.442 Third, piecing together the credible components of Mr Tiong’s testimony with the objective and corroborative evidence showed that he had been taking direct trading instructions from the Second Accused, and Mr Tiong certainly knew he had been doing so. 443 For completeness, I should state that I did not think my findings that Mr Richard Ooi’s three other Relevant Accounts had been under the accused persons’ control (see [438(f)] above) directly supported the Prosecution’s case in respect of these two accounts under Mr Tiong’s management. The control of each account needed to be assessed on its own evidence. That said, after arriving at my conclusion on the basis of the other available evidence, my findings on those other accounts served as a useful reference to cross-check my findings here. In sum, I found that the Second Accused had exercised control over Mr Richard Ooi’s two Relevant Accounts with Phillip Securities under the management of Mr Tiong.(17) Twenty-seven accounts under Mr Wong XY444 As alluded to at [129] above, Mr Wong XY was a significant character in the Defence’s case. Apart from the TRs within the Manhattan House Group, to which I will turn at [648] below, the accused persons alleged that Mr Wong XY had also misused the Relevant Accounts under his management in order to generate commissions for himself. More specifically, the Defence suggested that Mr Wong XY either acted on his own, on the instructions of Ms Tracy Ooi, or both.

 in respect of these 27 accounts was that both accused persons had given trading instructions directly to Mr Wong XY. In addition to this general position, the Prosecution also asserted more granularly that: (a) in relation to one of Mr Billy Ooi’s two accounts, as well as one of Mr Chiew’s two accounts, the accused persons had also relayed instructions to Mr Wong XY through Ms Tracy Ooi;

447 Mr Wong XY was the Prosecution’s key witness in respect of these 27 accounts. Mr Chen, Mr Goh HC (in relation to his wife, Ms Huang’s, accounts) and Mr Hong’s testimonies were also relevant, but the other accountholders listed above had not been called as witnesses. Simply put, Mr Wong XY’s evidence supported the Prosecution’s case and, as seen above, as did Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC’s (see [203]–[228] and [241] above, respectively). Mr Hong’s testimony did not align with the Prosecution’s case, but, as stated at [357]–[373] above, I did not find him a credible witness.448 That said, the testimonies of Mr Chen, Mr Goh HC and Mr Hong did not generally address the question of “control” in respect of all 27 Relevant Accounts within this subgroup. Their evidence only bore on the issue where their own accounts with AmFraser were concerned. Accordingly, this being the general state of the Prosecution’s direct evidence against the accused persons, the focal point of my analysis was, necessarily, Mr Wong XY’s testimony, the truthfulness of which was rigorously disputed by the Defence. In this section, I will set out the most salient portions of the narrative put forth by Mr Wong XY and explain how it was supported by the documentary records, the investigative work done by the CAD (see [112]–[113] above), the GovTech Evidence, as well as the testimonies of other witnesses. After doing so, I will then state the Defence’s case in respect of Mr Wong XY and explain why I did not accept it. 449 From June 2009 until December 2015, Mr Wong XY was a commissioned dealer engaged by AmFraser.

 His involvement in the accused persons’ alleged Scheme was set in motion sometime in 2009 or 2010 when he first met Ms Tracy Ooi through one of his clients. On his account, they became good friends and Ms Tracy Ooi had, on occasion, even referred clients to him.

 Subsequently, however, the Second Accused contacted him to ask if he had a trading account of his own or “friendly accounts” which could be used to trade. The Second Accused apparently informed him that, if she could use such accounts to place trades, she would settle the losses and commissions incurred in the accounts.

 Mr Wong XY approached friends who had opened trading accounts with him. Initially, those friends were Mr Lim HP, Mr Lim LA and Mr Toh, who allowed their accounts to be used. The Second Accused, thereafter, started giving instructions for BAL orders to be placed in the accounts of Mr Wong XY’s three friends. Subsequently, as the Second Accused’s instructions became more regular, Mr Wong XY found that the trading limits of Mr Lim HP, Mr Lim LA and Mr Toh’s accounts were insufficient to execute the orders directed. Consequently, Mr Wong approached more friends for permission to use their accounts. It should be noted, however, that these additional friends’ accounts did not form a part of the Prosecution’s case.

452 The next significant event took place in June 2012. At a meeting, the First Accused asked Mr Wong XY how he could “expand his lines”. By this, the First Accused apparently meant how Mr Wong XY could increase his general capacity to place trades. Acting on this, Mr Wong XY then approached a further 12 close friends to ask if they would be agreeable to him using their accounts to place trades. Mr Wong XY explained that the persons behind the trades were financially reliable. Thus, they agreed.

When all these accounts were opened, the clear understanding was that they would be nominee accounts for [the First Accused (“JS”)] and [the Second Accused] to place their trades in. This was based on my discussion with JS in the LionGold office where he had asked me how I could expand my lines.454 Apart from new accounts, existing AmFraser accounts had also been transferred to Mr Wong XY’s management. First, Ms Tracy Ooi had, in early 2011, made arrangements for Ms Huang’s account to be transferred to his management. The transfer was effected on 5 April 2011 but, according to Mr Wong XY, the first trade he executed in that account only took place on 16 February 2012 for LionGold shares.

 bringing the overall hit-rate captured by the GovTech Evidence to just 27.7%. This figure remained an outlier from the others and, in my view, did not offer meaningful support to either Mr Wong XY’s evidence or the Prosecution’s case. However, the more pertinent question was whether this figure contradicted Mr Wong XY’s evidence or the Prosecution’s case. The answer was ‘no’. By way of reminder, as stated at [115(a)], Ms Sheryl Tan explained a specific limitation of the GovTech Evidence was that communications via WhatsApp fell outside the analysis.

Instead, as stated, the GovTech Evidence simply offered no meaningful support to the Prosecution’s case as regards this account.459 Where the other accounts were concerned, however, the hits and hit-rates were revealing. In fact, so too was the extensive volume of communications the accused persons had with Mr Wong XY, particularly the First Accused. Across the entire Relevant Period, the First Accused and Mr Wong XY communicated by phone 2287 times. In respect of the Second Accused, the figure was 978. For the landlines which had been in LionGold’s meeting room and the Dubai Room (see [677] below), the figures were 373 and 191 respectively.

 460 This begged the question: What was the accused persons’ relationship with Mr Wong XY that such a high volume of communications was necessary, especially since the First Accused did not even have a trading account with AmFraser under Mr Wong XY’s management? To this question, the First Accused naturally denied giving trading instructions to Mr Wong XY. Instead, he said that he had only relayed instructions for his family members; namely, Mr Soh KC, Mr Soh HC, Mr Soh HY and Mr Tan BK. He would also sometimes promote LionGold shares to Mr Wong XY. Conversely, Mr Wong XY would sometimes refer high-net-worth investors or deals to him.

As regards the First Accused’s explanations for the communications, they could not account for the 2,287 communications across the 14 months of the Relevant Period. (Of these, 1505 proceeded from the First Accused to Mr Wong XY, and the remaining 782 proceeded from Mr Wong XY to the First Accused).

 and as for the latter, there was only so much the First Accused could promote a share without becoming pointlessly repetitive (also see my observation at [488] below).

 The First Accused was obviously not in any position to explain the Second Accused’s communications with Mr Wong XY. And while I accepted that there was nothing inherently incriminating about a high volume of communications between two individuals, it did not stand alone. It was coupled with Mr Wong XY’s direct evidence, as well as the GovTech Evidence. In all, these certainly called for the Second Accused’s explanation. Given her decision not to testify, there was nothing else which I could test the objective evidence against. This left me with just: (a) Mr Wong XY’s evidence which, in my view, accommodated the objective facts; and (b) the First Accused’s evidence which not only struggled to logically accommodate the objective facts, it also could not account for the Second Accused’s position. There was nothing to detract from a conclusion that Mr Wong XY’s evidence was to be accepted. 463 Indeed, moving away from the more data-driven aspects of the Prosecution’s case and back to Mr Wong XY’s evidence, he also gave a fairly detailed account of how the accused persons specifically instructed him which, in turn, cohered with the Prosecution’s case. Mr Wong XY testified that whenever the accused persons gave him instructions, they did not typically specify the account in which the order was to be placed, largely leaving him to choose the account based on which had available trading limits.

 This was consistent with the evidence of other TRs (for example, Mr Alex Chew: see [236] above). 464 In a similar vein, when Mr Wong XY reported trades to the accused persons, he did not usually specify the account in which trades had been executed.

 However, he had to specify which of the Relevant Accountholders had due positions on the contra trades executed in their accounts. This account cohered with objective evidence adduced in relation to how other TRs operated. For example, the text messages at [252] above showed that Mr Alex Chew had also aggregated the accountholders’ positions, but had specified which accountholders had BAL shares due to be picked up or sold. Mr Wong Xu further explained that the accused persons’ “associates had accounts at various brokerages”, and they were “worried” that “the same person might be both the buyer and seller for [a] trade”.

 Keeping the accused persons apprised of whose positions were due thus helped them avoid such blatant wash trading. This aspect was consistent with Mr Tai’s evidence (the veracity of which I turn to at [688]–[694] below) who testified that the Second Accused had, on occasion, instructed him not to use the accounts of specific accountholders because those accountholders had accounts with other FIs which had placed orders on the other side of the book. As Mr Tai stated, she had said in Hokkien, “mai pa tio ka ki” (“don’t hit own self”).

 This, again, gelled with the evidence of numerous other TRs who stated that the accused persons generally traded in BAL on a contra basis (for example, the evidence of Mr Andy Lee at [325] above). Indeed, the fact that contra trading had been carried out in certain accounts – more specifically, those of Mr Lim HP, Mr Lim LA and Mr Toh – which did not even have high trading limits (see [450] above), was particularly revealing. I illustrate with Mr Lim HP and his account.466 In the documents Mr Lim HP had submitted to open his account with AmFraser in June 2009, he indicated that his annual income fell within the range of S$25,001 and S$50,000, and his net worth (which included his shares and real properties) was between S$250,001 and S$1,000,000.

 However, even a casual review of the SGX data revealed that the trades which had been executed in his account were disproportionate to this level of wealth. Consider the following illustration. On 19 April 2013, at 1.23.58pm, a bid for 300,000 LionGold shares at S$1.055 – a tick above the best bid of S$1.050 – had been entered into Mr Lim HP’s account. The order was instantly executed against several smaller sell orders.

 467 Looking at these profitable trades with the benefit of hindsight, it certainly was not impossible that Mr Lim HP had instructed them. After all, contra trades require no capital input. However, given that the value of his buy order was at least six years of his annual income in 2009, this was highly unlikely. Furthermore, there was some frequency to such relatively high-value BAL trades being executed in his account.

 The Defence’s claim that Mr Wong XY had wrongfully traded in the Relevant Accounts under his management in order to generate commissions for himself (see [130(c)] above) also could not logically account for why such high-value BAL trades had been placed in these relatively low-limit accounts. After all, that assertion rested on the fundamental premise that Mr Wong XY would have been earning commission from such wrongful trades. However, he would only have been able to generate wrongful commission if: (a) he never incurred any contra losses by sheer trading skill or pure luck; (b) his commission always exceeded the contra losses he would have had to cover; or (c) there was some other reason why he did not have to bear contra losses. The first was impossible; the second was implausible – particularly so because the terms on which he received commission were not even the best AmFraser had to offer;

 and the third (which was Mr Wong XY’s testimony: see [449] above), by comparison, was wholly plausible. 468 In fact, Mr Wong XY’s explanation as regards how the accused persons settled contra losses in the Relevant Accounts matched the surrounding evidence. As a starting point, he testified that when he reported losses to the accused persons, he did not give them an account-by-account breakdown of the losses as they did not require this.

 Where profits had been made in their associates’ accounts (ie, the Relevant Accounts other than those of Mr Lim HP, Mr Lim LA and Mr Toh), the profits would be kept in their associates’ accompanying trust accounts to settle (future) contra losses. If their associates’ trust accounts did not have enough funds to settle such losses, Mr Wong XY stated that he would inform either or both accused persons. They would, he said “always get one of the same two male Malay runners to deliver cash to [him]”, the runners being Mr Jumaat and Mr Najib.

Even Mr Tiong – found to be an uncreditworthy witness who told only partial truths (see [428]–[443] above) – acknowledged this highly specific arrangement for the settlement of contra losses. Objectively, Mr Wong XY’s name also featured a substantial 59 times on Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet, indicating that the arrangement did in fact exist.

 which lent this piece of evidence even greater weight. In fact, there were messages which had been sent by Mr Wong XY to the First Accused after the Crash which revealed plainly that the former regarded the latter as responsible for the losses suffered in the Relevant Accounts. For example, on 10 February 2014 at 5.10.45pm, Mr Wong XY said: “Sorry Sir, may I ask would there be any payments for me today? Thanks XY”.

Mr Wong XY explained that he had agreed because he wanted to be in the First Accused’s “good books”. Given how well-connected the latter was, Mr Wong XY had hoped to get business through him.

She directed him to prepare a cheque for S$570,000 to that end.

However, when viewed alongside all the evidence discussed above, they shed light on the nature of the relationship between the accused persons and Mr Wong XY. Based on these objective and observable components of their relationship, the Prosecution suggested that Mr Wong XY was yet another TR eager to please the accused persons, earn commissions and, thus, had been willing to let them control the Relevant Accounts despite the fact that they had not been properly authorised to do so.472 As against this, the Defence submitted generally that Mr Wong XY had lied about taking instructions from them, that he had been “front-running” in the Relevant Accounts, and running his own “side rings”. He was also said to have been a “young and greedy TR who took the opportunity to get close to the accused persons for their connections and further opportunities”.

Undisputed that Wong Xue Yu [(“WXY”)] was Running his Own Side Ring Unbeknownst to the Accused PersonsWXY denied that any arrangement between [Ms Tracy Ooi (“Tracy”)] and himself where she gave tips or instructions on BAL shares and he used those tips or instructions to trade in the accounts of his family and friends. However, the reality was that WXY was actively trading in a lot more accounts, accounts that were in the names of WXY’s own friends and contacts, whom the Accused Persons did not know at all. In fact, WXY’s activities in the non-controlled accounts were significantly greater than the activities in the controlled accounts.Upon reviewing the trade data, it was apparent that if WXY was involved in any kind of wrongdoing, he was carrying it out primarily through the Category 2 accounts [these were accounts belonging to WXY’s friends in respect of which WXY had allegedly taken instructions from the accused persons].

 When questioned on Category 2 accounts, WXY’s evidence was not believable:(a) WXY claimed that the Category 2 accounts originated from a “how can you expand your lines” meeting with 1st Accused which took place at the LionGold office in June 2012. However, no such meeting could have taken place as LionGold had not even moved to the premises at Mohd Sultan at the time. Moreover, 7 to 9 Category 2 accounts were opened in June 2012 and at least 7 Category 3 accounts were opened in June or July 2012. WXY clearly fabricated the timing of this alleged meeting to try and pin these accounts on the Accused Persons.(b) By WXY’s own admission, he did not tell the 1st Accused about these new Category 2 accounts, nor did he tell the 1st Accused about the number of accounts that he found. Moreover, WXY confirmed that the 1st Accused did not know who the accountholders were or what trades were done. What is telling is that the Prosecution did not lead any evidence showing that WXY had discussed or even mentioned any of the Category 2 accounts to the Accused Persons. Even on WXY’s own evidence, the Accused Persons did not have knowledge of these accounts. It is simply not possible that the Accused Persons gave all the instructions and were in full control without knowing what accounts WXY was using or even how many accounts there were. The Prosecution may try to argue that the 1st Accused gave broad instructions and left it to WXY to execute.

 accounts if there were no trading limits in Category 2 accounts. This flies in the face of the entire Prosecution case. There can be no conspiracy to use accounts that the Accused Persons knew nothing about. If this is the case, there should be phone calls proximate to the Category 2 trades. However, this is not borne out by the evidence. Further, the fact that these accounts were not the subject matter of the charges shows that the Prosecution themselves were doubtful of WXY’s story.(d) Instead there are phone calls between WXY and Tracy that are proximate to the Category 2 trades. For example, on 17 September 2012, Tracy had called WXY at 14:35:58 to 14:36:24.677 Subsequently, WXY entered a buy order in [Mr Lim HP’s (“LHP”)] account in Asiasons at 14:41:37. There were no calls from the 1st Accused prior to the trade, and there was only 1 call from the 2nd Accused to WXY at 10:47:00.678 On some days, the trades in Category 2 accounts were preceded by calls from both 1st Accused and Tracy. On 2 April 2013,there was a call between Tracy and WXY at 14:26:35 to 14:36:10.679 At the same time, there was another call between the 1st Accused and WXY at 14:35:51 to 14:36:14. This was followed by a sell order in [Mr Lim LA’s (“LLA”)] account in Asiasons at 14:39:04.680 This was also recorded as a GovTech “hit” for the 1st Accused. Notwithstanding the fact that it would be impossible for WXY to be on both calls concurrently (which shows yet another flaw in the GovTech analysis and telecommunication records), it is likely that it was Tracy and not the 1st Accused who had given instructions in LLA’s account.(e) Further, it is clear that the trading volumes in the Category 2 accounts exceeded IO-G trading volume. Again, this flies in the face of the Prosecution’s case.(f) In particular, LHP, LLA and [Mr Toh (“THB”)] accounts were not instructed by the Accused Persons. These accounts were opened in 2009, before WXY had met Tracy or the 2nd Accused. For the entire time period, and for all 3 accounts, the GovTech “hits” for BAL for the 1st Accused were below 25% in any of these 3 accounts. The most telling months were May, Aug and Sep 2013, where the GovTech “hits” were very low.Further, WXY’s narrative in relation to payment of losses and collection of profits in relation to these Category 2 accounts are inherently incredible:(a) WXY stated that all 18 accounts belonging to his family and friends – some of whom were described as WXY’s occasional drinking buddies, and some of whom WXY only met once or twice – all went through the rigmarole of going to the bank, withdrawing cash paid out as profits, and passing the cash back to WXY. If these accounts suffered losses, WXY would also deposit cash with the AmFraser cashier. WXY’s description of his arrangement with his friends / nominees is unbelievable and cannot possibly be true. WXY could very well have just left the profits in the trust accounts with AmFraser where AmFraser can easily deduct any losses against the trust account. The alleged arrangement of WXY, of getting his friends to withdraw profits in cash and pass them to him is simply absurd.(b) WXY has stated that the arrangement was that the Accused Persons would bear all the losses and all profits went to the Accused Persons. However, even though these accounts were actively trading, WXY stated that he did not keep any sort of accounting of how much he had collected and how much he had paid for these 18 accounts. It is unbelievable that the Accused Persons were entitled to the profits but did not receive any and did not require any records.(c) WXY’s position is also absurd as if all trades were done for the 1st Accused, WXY would not know the amounts to collect from the Accused Persons if the accounts faced a net loss. When this illogicality was pointed out to WXY on the stand, he gave an absurd explanation that he would tabulate the total losses and write it down on some rough paper, and would give daily reports to the 1st Accused on an “amalgamated basis”. As shown above, there were no such daily reports. Moreover, WXY stated that if the accounts had a net gain, he would not pass the monies to the 1st Accused, but would hold onto the monies. This position is simply one that is beneficial only to WXY, and is clearly yet another one of his poorly thought-out lies to cover for his side rings.(d) Moreover, WXY agreed that he made a few million dollars profit (including [S$]300–400k in LHP, LLA and THB’s accounts). Further, WXY admitted that his father’s account made substantial profits of 3 to 4 million. These were not paid to the Accused Persons, by WXY’s own admission.For the above reasons, it is clear WXY’s evidence in court paints a different picture from what he had stated in his conditioned statement, and in fact, the Category 2 accounts were put as a smokescreen to hide the fact that he was trading heavily in BAL accounts for his own benefit using these accounts.As for Category 3 and 4 accounts [category 3 was said to include WXY’s clients who had traded in BAL shares but, in respect of which WXY did not allege that the accused persons had given trading instructions;

 these are all WXY’s side-rings which he had attempted to conceal from the authorities/place the blame on the Accused Persons. WXY and his covering officer, William Soo, had engaged in front-running in these accounts for the orders done in Category 1 and 2 accounts on Clear Days. The sheer number of instances shown to WXY in cross-examination clearly demonstrates that this is no mere coincidence. However, WXY admitted that these accounts had nothing to do with the Accused Persons and were total strangers to the 1st Accused. By WXY’s own admission, he was the one who encouraged these Category 3 accounts unconnected to the 1st Accused to trade in BAL, so that he could make commissions. It is clear that these accounts were trading as part of WXY’s greedy scheme to make commissions from front running BAL.[footnotes omitted; footnotes and clarifications added]473 In its written reply, the Prosecution mirrored the Defence and similarly produced an extraordinarily granular response.

In fact, from [1275]–[1286] below, I will address the particular sequence of trades which gave rise to the large cashier’s order being issued in favour of “Rodyk”. It suffices to say here that those events did not undercut the evidence Mr Wong XY gave in his conditioned statement, nor did it support the Defence’s broader claim that Mr Wong XY was a rogue who had profited heavily from carrying out wrongful trading activities at the expense of the accused persons’ associates. 476 The Prosecution also highlighted several other inaccuracies in the Defence’s characterisation of the evidence.

 I do not propose to deal with each of them. This is because, although I appreciated the Prosecution’s industry in going through the Defence’s evidential references, I did not ultimately think that it was necessary. In fact, that the Prosecution and Defence locked horns on almost every allegation, submission, and evidential reference, did more to obscure the most important question that arose in relation to these accounts, than to illuminate it.477 As I have stated at [460] and [471] above, given the objective evidence adduced, the persistent question which arose was what exactly had been the accused persons’ relationship with Mr Wong XY? The character of this relationship needed to accommodate the most inculpatory strands of evidence in a manner so as to render them capable of innocent explanation. It was only on this foundation that the accused persons could build a positive case as regards what Mr Wong XY had actually been doing if not acting under their control. 478 In my judgment, the most inculpatory strands of evidence included: (a) the enormous volume of communications between the accused persons and Mr Wong XY, which additionally yielded the GovTech Evidence reproduced at [455] above; and (b) the records which strongly suggested that the accused persons had paid for the contra losses suffered in the accounts (see [469] above).

 simply did not make headway with this question and this was ultimately fatal to its position. It was those components of the Prosecution’s case that were foundational and most in need of explanation and, absent a credible explanation, the remainder of the Defence’s case did not have a sufficiently strong leg on which it could stand.

 480  As a preface, it should be restated that there were no witnesses for the Prosecution who gave evidence in respect of the usage of this account. This was because as mentioned at [146], Mr Sugiarto was certified medically unfit to give evidence in court. The option for Mr Sugiarto to give evidence via video-link from his home was explored, but this was not agreeable to the Defence. As for Mr Yong, he no longer resided in Singapore (having moved to Australia). Given the travel restrictions at the time, the Prosecution also applied for Mr Yong to give evidence remotely pursuant to s 28(1) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (Act No 14 of 2020).

481 The statements of Mr Yong did not directly incriminate either accused person. That was, Mr Yong did not specifically name either the First or Second Accused as individuals who had communicated trading instructions to him in respect of Advance Assets’ account. Nevertheless, there were three points arising from the two statements which I found particularly probative. (a) First, Mr Yong informed the CAD that he had received instructions from a person other than Mr Sugiarto. Prior to taking instructions from this person, Mr Yong stated that he clarified the identity of this individual with Mr Sugiarto, who told him that this person was his brother, and that it was suitable for Mr Yong to accept instructions therefrom.

 482 When considered alongside my finding that the First Accused was the exclusive user of the 678 number (see [198(b)] above), the answers given by Mr Yong were, in my view, enough to give rise to the inference that the First Accused had communicated trading instructions to Mr Yong as Mr Sugiarto’s “brother”. In drawing this inference, I was extremely mindful of the absence of direct oral evidence from either Mr Sugiarto or Mr Yong. Such direct oral evidence would then have been subject to cross-examination. Indeed, I was very conscious that without a witness to speak on the circumstances surrounding this account more fully, certain gaps could not be filled. 483 For example, as I state at [496] below, Ms Yu – a TR with CIMB – testified that the First Accused had given trading instructions in respect of an account held personally by Mr Sugiarto with this FI. Where this account was concerned however, the First Accused had made known to Ms Yu that his name was “John” and, Mr Sugiarto, in informing Ms Yu that it was suitable for her to take instructions from the First Accused, also referred to him as “John”. No attempt was made to clothe the First Accused with the guise of being related to Mr Sugiarto. In fact, Ms Yu expressly testified that she was not even aware of the underlying arrangement between Mr Sugiarto and the First Accused.

 To my mind, this naturally begged the question of why, when it came to giving trading instructions for this account, the First Accused might have regarded it necessary to conceal his name or true relationship with Mr Sugiarto from Mr Yong? 484 Prima facie, it did not appear that Mr Yong was a particularly conscientious or careful TR. After all, on the account he gave to the CAD, he was willing to take instructions from Mr Sugiarto’s “brother” without having done anything to verify this individual’s actual identity, nor did he insist on Mr Sugiarto putting in formal written authorisation.

 This may be contrasted with my observations vis-à-vis Mr See and the Relevant Account of Annica Holdings held with Lim & Tan (see [409]–[419] above), in respect of which I found that the First Accused only relayed instructions through Mr Sugiarto. No attempt was even made to instruct Mr See directly, whether as “John” or guised as someone else. This was certainly a gap in the narrative advanced by the Prosecution which I would have preferred to be filled in. 485 That said, that there were gaps was not necessarily fatal to the Prosecution’s case. As I said above, the contents of Mr Yong’s investigation statements, when considered alongside my finding that the First Accused was the exclusive user of the 678 number, was sufficient to give rise to the inference that he had been communicating trading instructions to Mr Yong. Such an inference being supportable on those bases, the question which then arose was whether the gaps in the Prosecution’s case resulting from the absence of both Mr Sugiarto and Mr Yong as witnesses, gave rise to reasonable doubt as to the correctness of that inference. 486 In my judgment, the answer was “no”. I arrived at this view after careful weighing of four key considerations. First, the fact that the objective telecommunications records showed that the First Accused had communicated with Mr Yong very extensively. During the Relevant Period, they communicated with each other 623 times over the phone (both calls and messages). Setting aside the short period of 1 to 3 October 2013 before the Crash, where they communicated for only four times, for the other months within the Relevant Period from August 2012 to September 2013, they communicated for between 23 to 120 times per month.

487 Unless there was some other more cogent explanation which could account for such extensive communications, the objective records plainly corroborated the inference drawn. The First Accused, however, provided no such explanation. On the First Accused’s evidence, he had never met Mr Yong in person. Nevertheless, he stated that Mr Yong “could have” been a TR to whom he spoke over the phone “from time to time” to banter, discuss world events, politics, and to promote LionGold shares. Similar to other TRs discussed earlier in these grounds (see, eg, [294] above), the thrust of the First Accused’s evidence was that Mr Yong was “just one of the random brokers that [he] connect[ed] with for intel or … to promote LionGold”.

 488 I could not believe this. Even taking at face value the First Accused’s evidence that he would have engaged in friendly banter over the phone with Mr Yong despite having never met him in person, it completely strained credulity that a man as busy as the First Accused claimed to be, would have had the time to speak to a “random broker” as frequently as he did, for the reasons he gave. Even in a light month, for example, 20 communications in July 2013, I could not imagine why it would have been necessary for First Accused to promote LionGold on so many occasions. If he had been engaged in such promotion at least since the beginning of the Relevant Period (ie, August 2012), and Mr Yong had not yet been sold on the value of the share by July 2013, the expression ‘flogging a dead horse’ comes to mind. Equally, banter about world events and politics could also hardly account for the communications. As a continuing illustration, of the 20 communications in July 2013, 13 were calls, 11 of which lasted less than 60 seconds.

 It was unclear how the First Accused and Mr Yong would have bantered about world events and politics so speedily. I was mindful that the actual contents of these calls were not known. However, it was entirely improbable that their contents would have borne out the First Accused’s explanation. 489 In any event, as a more fundamental point, I rejected the contrived explanation that the First Accused might have maintained friendly and casual contact with Mr Yong as himself. In response to the question “do you know who John Soh Chee Wen is”, Mr Yong told the CAD that, although he had come across the name in newspapers, he did not know the individual “at all”.

 If the First Accused had been in contact with Mr Yong for reasons as innocuous as promoting LionGold shares or friendly banter, there would have been absolutely no reason for Mr Yong to deny knowing him. 490 Second, the records also showed that a sizeable portion of the communications between the First Accused and Mr Yong took the form of short messages sent by the latter to the former before or within an hour of the start of the trading day. Throughout the Relevant Period, Mr Yong sent the 678 number a total of 128 short messages before 10.00am.

 The First Accused’s explanation could not logically account for this. Instead, this was consistent with the inference that the user of the 678 number had been giving Mr Yong trading instructions. Such messages would, in turn, have been Mr Yong reporting the trades due on those days. In a similar vein, throughout the Relevant Period Mr Yong had also sent 186 messages to the 678 number between 10.00am and 5.09pm (until shortly after the close of the trading day).

 This pattern of communication also did not cohere with the First Accused’s explanation, but again, it was consistent with Mr Yong providing confirmation to the user of the 678 number that instructed orders had been executed in the market.491 Third, the GovTech Evidence also strongly corroborated the inference.

 For reasons I will explain at [744]–[750] below, I did not accept the First Accused’s account as to why he and the Second Accused were monitoring the shareholding of various Relevant Accounts. Therefore, the fact that Advance Assets’ shareholding was being kept track at all was, in my view, supportive of the conclusion that the accused persons had this account in their field of vision for some purpose. 493 In the round, notwithstanding Mr Sugiarto and Mr Yong’s absence as witnesses, I was satisfied that these four points of corroboration were enough to render it safe to infer that the First Accused had exercised control over Advance Assets’ DBS Vickers account. In my judgment, the evidence established that he did so by directly instructing Mr Yong on the BAL orders and trades to place in the account. I was less certain, however, of the Prosecution’s case that the First Accused had also exercised control over this account by relaying instructions to Mr Yong through Mr Sugiarto.

 Ms Yu was called as a witness, but as mentioned at [146] and [399] above, Mr Sugiarto was unable to give evidence because of illness.495 By way of general background, Ms Yu’s evidence was that she had become acquainted with the Second Accused sometime in May 2009 when the latter opened an account with CIMB with Ms Yu as her appointed TR. After the account was first opened, the Second Accused gave Ms Yu trading instructions personally. However, not long thereafter, the Second Accused told Ms Yu verbally that there was no issue with her receiving and acting on trading instructions given by the First Accused.

 Thus, through the Second Accused, Ms Yu and the First Accused also became acquainted.496 On this footing, in December 2009, the First Accused made arrangements for Mr Sugiarto to open an account with CIMB under the management of Ms Yu.

 and, thereafter, the First Accused began giving trading instructions for Mr Sugiarto’s account. As with the Second Accused’s account, Ms Yu also testified that “most, if not all” of the trades executed in Mr Sugiarto’s account had been instructed by the First Accused.

 This, alongside Ms Yu’s testimony, led to the conclusion that the First Accused had exercised control over Mr Sugiarto’s account. 498 However, the conclusion as regards the Second Accused was somewhat less clear. As stated, Ms Yu’s primary evidence was that the First Accused had instructed most, if not all, of the trades placed in Mr Sugiarto’s account. Ms Yu did not positively state that the Second Accused had also given her trading instructions in respect of this account. Thus, given my observations on the utility of the GovTech Evidence at [115]–[120] above (particularly [119] where I stated that, although this category of evidence did not possess primary evidential value, it could possess corroborative value), the GovTech Evidence alone could not support the Prosecution’s case that both accused persons had exercised control over this account. 499 That said, although “control” most naturally involved instructing trades in the Relevant Accounts (and receiving trade reports thereon), this was not all it entailed. It also involved managing the finances of the accounts. And, in this regard, Ms Yu gave evidence that there were occasions on which the First Accused had directed her to pick up the BAL shares purchased in both the Second Accused and Mr Sugiarto’s accounts, rather than trading them on a contra basis. On these occasions, it was the Second Accused who contacted Ms Yu to inform her that Mr Najib

 500 This was, in my view, just enough to support the conclusion that the Second Accused knew of and was involved in using Mr Sugiarto’s account to trade in BAL shares, even though she may not have been the one communicating trading instructions to Ms Yu. In turn, this called for an explanation from the Second Accused as to why, on Ms Yu’s evidence, she had been involved in arranging payments for shares picked up in Mr Sugiarto’s account. As the Second Accused elected not to give evidence, Ms Yu’s testimony went unchallenged on this point. I accordingly found that the Second Accused had also exercised control over Mr Sugiarto’s account, although I did not accept the Prosecution’s specific case that she had given Ms Yu trading instructions. This, however, did not bear on the False Trading or Price Manipulation Charges given their nature. It is trite that, in a conspiracy, each conspirator need not fulfil exactly the same functions. Thus, the fact that the Second Accused did not “control” Mr Sugiarto’s account in the sense of conveying trading instructions to Ms Yu was inconsequential.501 The foregoing conclusions were not affected by the contentions raised by the First Accused, none of which I accepted. There were four. First, the First Accused made the following assertion:

 The account was opened in December 2009, and this scarcely related to the Relevant Period, during which, as stated at [496] above, Ms Yu’s evidence was that the First Accused had given “most, if not all” of the trading instructions. Two, Ms Yu did not admit during cross-examination that Mr Sugiarto was the beneficial owner of his own account. The portion of the notes of evidence to which the First Accused referred in support of this assertion only showed Ms Yu agreeing that the Second Accused was the beneficial owner of her own account. She did not give the same evidence in respect of Mr Sugiarto’s account. In my view, the Prosecution rightly submitted that this was consistent with their case.

503 Second, the First Accused stated that he had not “instructed” trades in Mr Sugiarto’s account. Instead, he had paid special attention to the account because it was a joint investment account established by Tan Sri Mat Ngah and Mr Sugiarto. As Tan Sri Mat Ngah was one of the First Accused’s first “major benefactors”, the First Accused was presumably grateful and assisted in “looking after” the account.

 504 I found this explanation rather lacking in substance. It failed to answer why the account had been opened in Mr Sugiarto’s sole name if it was meant to be a joint investment account, and why the First Accused had to pay close attention to this specific account involving Mr Sugiarto if his moral debt was owed only to Tan Sri Mat Ngah. In any event, given that the account traded almost exclusively in BAL shares on a roll-over contra basis, it was not clear what trading strategy the First Accused was apparently advising Ms Yu to adopt in order to aid the account in making profits. 505 Third, the First Accused submitted that there was no evidence that trade reports had been sent to him in order for him to exercise control over the account.

 As would be evident from the foregoing paragraphs, my findings in respect of this account essentially depended on Ms Yu’s evidence and, thus, its credibility was crucial. However, the argument that she had lied before and was therefore lying in court was tenuous at best. 507 While Ms Yu admitted that she did not initially inform the CAD that the First Accused had been the one giving trading instructions for the Second Accused and Mr Sugiarto’s accounts, she explained that she had done so because she was in the midst of a divorce and custody battle for her son. She therefore feared that she would lose her job and, ultimately, custody of her son. In any case, it only took Ms Yu two days to admit to the fact that she had taken trading instructions from the First Accused, knowing full well that she had done so without having checked if either the Second Accused or Mr Sugiarto had properly authorised this in writing. For this, Ms Yu was subsequently suspended by CIMB for a month without pay.

 In the circumstances, there was nothing about Ms Yu’s initial lack of candour which could support the conclusion that her evidence in court ought not to be believed.(20) Whether these Local Accounts were part of the Scheme508 Save for Ms Cheng’s one account with CIMB under the management of Ms Tian (see [420] above), I found that the remaining 82 Relevant Account falling within Group 1 had been controlled by either or both the First and Second Accused. A question which I have not answered fully in the paragraphs above, however, was whether they controlled each of these accounts in connection with the Scheme. Of course, it was possible that they could have been exercising such control in a haphazard and disorganised manner, with no common objective and, thus, without any scheme in mind, much less the specific Scheme as articulated by the Prosecution. However, in light of my findings above, that was a wholly fanciful possibility. 509 In my judgment, the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts within Group 1 was certainly targeted at some common objective. At this juncture, I will not address what that common objective was. As I have stated at the outset of my analysis (see [192] above), a systematic approach needs to be taken in cases like these, so as to gradually build up to the ultimate inferences to be drawn. I will only return to that question at [889] below, after I have discussed: the accused persons’ alleged control of the Relevant Accounts in Groups 2, 3, 4 and the Manhattan House Group; their efforts at coordination; the illegitimate trading practices they used; the intended endgame for the Scheme; and their actions after the Crash. For now, I will focus only on why I took the view that there was a thread which connected the accused persons’ control of these accounts, without analysing what that thread specifically was.510 The clearest factors which pointed towards the existence of a common thread were: (a) the fact of control in and of itself, alongside (b) the large number of accounts in respect of which such control had been exercised. The exercise of concealed control of a trading account was, by itself, a key indicium of illegal activity lurking beneath the ostensibly legitimate surface of seemingly ordinary trades being placed in a seemingly ordinary account. There was and there remains no good reason for individuals to exercise hidden control over trading accounts belonging to others. Indeed, viewing such concealed control with anything other than utmost scepticism would be at odds with Singapore’s robust legislative and administrative frameworks designed to prevent money laundering (“AML”) and counter the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) (on these frameworks broadly, see Alvin Yeo SC and Joy Tan, “Singapore” in International Guide to Money Laundering Law and Practice (Arun Srivastava, Mark Simpson, and Richard Powell gen eds) (Bloomsbury Professional, 5th Ed, 2019)). 511 Of course, I accepted that the mere exercise of concealed control over a trading account did not necessarily mean that the hidden controller was partaking in some illegal activity. However, as I have stated, there is no good reason for the exercise of such control to be concealed. Thus, where such a finding is made, an explanation is called for, and, in the absence of one, negative inferences naturally follow. As I have stated at various points above, the evidence in the present case showed that the accused persons wanted to be concealed. For example, as mentioned at [44] above, it was Mr Jack Ng’s evidence that the Second Accused had specifically refused to complete formal third-party authorisation forms, and had even threatened to move hers and the Relevant Accountholders’ accounts elsewhere when asked to complete such forms. As regards the First Accused, given that he was an undischarged bankrupt, the FIs likely would not have allowed the Relevant Accountholders to grant him formal authority to place trades in their accounts.

512 I was conscious that they did not conduct themselves in this manner for each and every account within Group 1. However, that was not a point in their favour. Each TR had different reasons for accepting their instructions. TRs like Mr Ong KC acted on the trust he had in Mr Chen and the First Accused (see [41] above), and others like Mr Wong XY were, because of greed, happy to take unauthorised instructions from the accused persons without bringing such instructions to AmFraser’s attention (see [44] above).513 Ultimately, the fundamental point was that the accused persons had exercised control over 82 Relevant Accounts in Group 1 (again, all save for that of Ms Cheng held with CIMB), and the manner in which their control had been exercised was concealed from the local FIs in one way or another. Indeed, a representative from each of the nine local FIs – namely, Mr Tan SK for AmFraser,

 – gave evidence that their respective FIs had not been aware that the accused persons were the ones instructing trades in the Relevant Accounts held with them. 514 It was therefore clear that the accused persons’ control of the 82 Local Accounts within Group 1 had been concealed. In the face of this finding, the question which then needed to be asked was whether there was some other innocent explanation for such extensive concealed control. 515 In the circumstances of the present case, the answer was a simple “no”. The First Accused’s clear and positive case was that he had not exercised control over any of the Relevant Accounts.

 Thus, naturally, he would not have given any such explanation. The Second Accused’s case was the same.

 Accordingly, though she elected to remain silent, it could be taken that even if she had given evidence, no explanation would have been provided as to why she had exercised control over some of the Local Accounts within Group 1. 516 In my view, the very fact of the accused persons’ extensive concealed controlled alone was sufficient to give rise to the strong inference that they had exercised such control for a common purpose. This inference was buttressed by three other crucial pieces of evidence. First, the account statements of these 82 accounts showed that they traded primarily and extensively in BAL shares. While I did not doubt that certain shares could “trend” and be well-promoted, it was highly improbable that such a large number of independent actors would not only have arrived at the same conclusion in terms of what shares to trade in, but also how to trade them. In this regard, it bears reminding that an uncommonly large number of the accounts traded actively on a contra basis, over the entirety of the Relevant Period, which was lengthy.

 This could not have been a legitimate money-making exercise since the payment of commissions and contra losses would, especially in the long-run, have likely resulted in the accounts being in the red. Second, many of the accounts in Group 1 featured in the Shareholding Schedule mentioned at [111] above, and which I will explain in greater detail at [744] below. Third, many also appeared in Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet mentioned at [111] above, and to which I will return at [751] below. Although these two spreadsheets did not reflect every account in Group 1, they demonstrated clear links between many of them. These links, in turn, showed that there was some common purpose underlying many of these accounts and, in my view, the “missing” links (so to speak) could be inferred. 517 I therefore found that the control which the accused persons exercised over the 82 Local Accounts within Group 1 had been exercised in connection with some common purpose. Group 2: Local Accounts; no Deception Charges brought518 As mentioned at [200], Group 2 comprised Local Accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges. There were 19 Relevant Accounts within this group:

 I should state, for accuracy, that Ms Lim SH’s account had been the subject matter of the Deception Charge: Charge 153. I have placed it in Group 2 instead of Group 1 because I acquitted the accused persons of this charge upon the Defence’s submission that there was no case to answer (see [1518]–[1519] below). (c) Third, seven corporate accounts in respect of which the Second Accused was a director and an authorised signatory. These corporations were IPCO’s subsidiaries. This included: (i) an account of Sun Spirit held with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Ang; (ii) four of Friendship Bridge held with Lim & Tan under the management of Mr See, CIMB under the management of Mr Tan LH, Maybank Kim Eng under the management of Mr Ong KC, and OCBC Securities under the management of Mr Aaron Ong; (iii) one of Nueviz Investment held with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua; and (iv) one of ESA Electronics held with OCBC Securities under the management Mr Jack Ng.519 As the Second Accused had formal authority to give trading instructions for these 19 accounts, it was not in question whether these accounts were under her “control” per se. Indeed, it was because of her formal authority, that there was nothing prima facie suspicious about her exercising such control. Thus, the question of “control” in respect of these accounts was somewhat different. It pertained to whether the Second Accused had used or allowed the accounts to be used in connection with the same common objective observed in relation to the Group 1 accounts (see [508]–[517] above). 520 This question could have been answered in a variety of ways, for example, by reference to relevant indicia such as: (a) whether these 19 accounts had appeared in the Shareholding Schedule, Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet, or other critical pieces of documentary evidence; (b) the type of trading activity seen in the accounts; or (c) the fact of the First Accused’s involvement in the use of the accounts. The third point was particularly relevant. After all, just as both accused persons could conceal their control of the Relevant Accounts within Group 1, the First Accused could conceal his control of the accounts in Group 2. The fact of such concealed control, in turn, as explained at [510] above, supported the inference that those accounts had been roped into the accused persons’ common objective.521 Indeed, in the following paragraphs, my analysis of the question in issue will be organised around the First Accused’s involvement. First, I will consider the accounts in respect of which the Prosecution’s case was that only the First Accused had given trading instructions.

 The testimonies of Mr Ong KC and his covering officer, Mr Lim TL, discussed in detail at [388]–[398] above, were therefore relevant.523 In Mr Ong KC’s conditioned statement, the evidence he gave in respect of this account was slightly ambiguous.

Then, referring to certain SGX exhibits and the telecommunications records, Mr Ong KC highlighted four orders on 5 and 14 February 2013 which he said the First Accused had instructed.

 testified that he had not given trading instructions for any Relevant Account belonging to IPCO’s subsidiaries. More broadly, he also stated that he had not been involved in the trading activities of the accounts at all, and that he only had knowledge of the general shareholdings of IPCO and its subsidiaries’ accounts, not the specific details of those accounts’ trading activity.

 At the trial, the Defence essentially sought to undermine this by pointing to the fact that Mr Smith had, at the time, been IPCO’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and either would have known the goings-on of the group’s trading accounts, or would have had the ability to find out. The thrust of Mr Smith’s response was that his actual role was more akin to a Chief Operating Officer and, thus, he did not see it as his duty to carry out such reviews. In any event, he also stated that he believed the Second Accused had been the decision-maker for the trading activity of the accounts, though he did not know whether she had allowed other persons to place trades in the accounts.

 530 In my view, the Defence’s line of attack was ineffective. Irrespective of what Mr Smith could or should have been doing as the CFO of IPCO, the point was that he had not been involved in the usage of the accounts and had essentially no knowledge thereof. Whether he had shirked his official duties as a CFO was entirely irrelevant for the purposes of these criminal proceedings against the accused persons. Given Mr Smith’s evidence, the only person who could have spoken to the usage of this account (and indeed the rest of the accounts held by IPCO’s subsidiaries as well) was the Second Accused. This was a matter “peculiarly within her knowledge” (see Oh Laye Koh at [14]), particularly given that Mr Ong KC’s evidence was that he had not been informed by IPCO’s management that the First Accused could give him instructions for Friendship Bridge’s account. In my view, the Second Accused’s silence justified a specific adverse inference against the Second Accused that there was no good rebuttal to Mr Ong KC’s evidence that the First Accused had used this account even though he had not been expressly authorised to do so, verbally, or otherwise. 531 In toto, on the grounds of: (a) Mr Ong KC’s evidence; as generally corroborated by Mr Lim TL; (b) the GovTech Evidence; (c) an analysis of the Asiasons trades executed in this account; and (d) an adverse inference drawn against the Second Accused, I found that the account had been controlled by the accused persons in connection with some broader purpose. 532 This brings me to the next subset of Relevant Accounts within Group 2 in respect of which the Prosecution’s case was that both accused persons had been involved in the use of the accounts. There were six accounts in total. Five were held in the Second Accused’s name: (a) two with AmFraser under the management of Mr Wong XY; (b) one with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua; (c) one with CIMB under the management of Ms Yu; and (d) one with OCBC Securities under the management of Mr Jack Ng. The sixth was held in the name of ESA Electronics with OCBC Securities under the management of Mr Jack Ng.

533 For the accounts under the management of Mr Wong XY, Ms Yu and Mr Jack Ng, the evidence of those TRs clearly established that both the accused persons had given trading instructions for accounts. (a) Mr Wong XY’s testimony, as set out at [444]–[478] above, applied to these two accounts as well. In addition, the GovTech Evidence showed a high rate of proximate calls between the First Accused and Mr Wong XY preceding Blumont and Asiasons orders being entered into these two accounts. As has been mentioned there was evidence that the First Accused typically took charge of trading instructions where those two counters had been concerned, while the Second Accused took charge of LionGold (see, eg, [338(c)] above). For Blumont shares, the hits (hit-rates) across the whole Relevant Period were five (100%) as regards the Second Accused’s margin account with AmFraser under Mr Wong XY (01-0030907) and 14 (82.4%) in respect of her cash account with AmFraser (01-0085222).

 As stated at [494]–[507], the First Accused denied this and sought to challenge the credibility of Ms Yu’s account, but that was not effective. Further, the GovTech Evidence strongly corroborated Ms Yu’s account vis-à-vis this account, once again, most strongly in respect of Blumont and Asiasons shares. For Blumont shares, the hits (hit-rates) across the entire Relevant Period were 42 (95.5%).

 Even more striking, and perhaps reflective of the corroborative weight which could be given to the GovTech Evidence, were the results of Authorised Persons’ Analysis. Throughout the whole Relevant Period, no proximate communications with the Second Accused preceded Blumont orders being entered in her own account, and, in respect of Asiasons orders, there was just one proximate communication.

534 Given that the First Accused had not been authorised to do so, the Second Accused’s explanation was certainly called for. Given her election not to testify, she could offer no alternative account in opposition to the evidence of Mr Wong XY, Ms Yu or Mr Jack Ng; nor could she give a potentially innocent explanation to account for the evidence against her. In my judgment, if unopposed, those pieces of evidence plainly supported the conclusion that the First Accused had been involved in giving Blumont and Asiasons instructions in these six accounts. In turn, his involvement supported the conclusion that these six accounts had been used for some broader illegitimate purpose. This conclusion was further solidified by the BAL trading-concentration set out at [539] below.535 This takes me to the Second Accused’s account managed by Ms Chua. The Prosecution’s case in respect of this account was that the First Accused had relayed instructions to Ms Chua through Ms Tracy Ooi. However, Ms Chua was not questioned on this point specifically in relation to the Second Accused’s account. My analysis of this account, as such, could not be undertaken on the same basis as the six accounts just discussed. Instead, it needed to be taken alongside the remaining 12 accounts within Group 2 – ie, those in respect of which the Prosecution’s case was that only the Second Accused had given trading instructions. 536 Those were: (a) one account of Ms Lim SH with UOB Kay Hian also under Ms Chua’s management; (b) two accounts of the Second Accused with Lim & Tan under Mr See; (c) two accounts of the Second Accused with DMG & Partners under Mr Jordan Chew; (d) one account of the Second Accused with DBS Vickers under Ms Chong YU; (e) one of Sun Spirit with UOB Kay Hian under Ms Ang; (f) one of Friendship Bridge with Lim & Tan under Mr See; (g) one of Friendship Bridge with CIMB under Mr Tan LH;

 Given that I rejected the First Accused’s explanation of the nature of the Shareholding Schedule (see [744]–[750] below), these appearances supported the inference that these eight accounts had been used for some broader, common purpose relating to BAL shares. 538 As regards all 13 accounts, however, I also relied on the high concentration of BAL trades seen in all 19 accounts within Group 2 (see next paragraph) which also supported that inference. These two key strands of evidence were, in my judgment, sufficient to call for an explanation from the Second Accused as to why she had such a large number of accounts trading so heavily in BAL shares, and, further, why other accounts over which she had formalised control also had such a high BAL trading-concentration. This pattern of trading was unusual and, absent an absent an explanation from the Second Accused, coupled with all the surrounding evidence, it was appropriate to adversely infer against the Second Accused that all 13 accounts had been used by the Second Accused in connection with some broader, common purpose relating to BAL shares.539 To round off, I deal with all 19 accounts as a block. At [519], I mentioned that the type of trading activity observable in the Relevant Accounts could support the inference that the 19 accounts within Group 2 were used in connection with the common objective seen vis-à-vis the Group 1 accounts. In the table below, I set out the percentage of trades executed in these 19 accounts during the Relevant Period which were either Blumont, Asiasons, or LionGold trades. This means that, if “50%” is indicated, half of all the trades carried out in the account were trades involving BAL shares. The remaining 50% would have been trades in counters other than BAL.

An investigatory exhibit adduced by Ms Sheryl Tan, that from which these figures were derived, showed that, for the Relevant Period, almost every Relevant Account held with a local FI had more than half of all their trades in BAL shares.

 This, alongside the other reasons I have given in the preceding paragraphs of this section, led me to the assured view that the accused persons had exercised control over each of the accounts in Group 2 towards a common objective. This common objective was that they had in respect of the accounts falling within Group 1, and, further – as the high concentration of BAL trades in the Local Accounts show – such purpose had something to do with the trading of Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold shares. Group 3: Foreign Accounts; Deception Charges brought541 As stated at [200], Group 3 comprised Foreign Accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges, save for the Foreign Accounts managed by Mr Tai as a member of the Manhattan House Group. There were 20 Relevant Accounts within this group: (a) three under the management of Infiniti Asset;

 (b) three under the management of Stamford Management; (c) five associated with Ms Cheng; and (d) nine managed by Alethia Asset. I address each of these four subgroups in turn.(1) Three accounts managed by Infiniti Asset542 As far as Group 3 was concerned, there were three RBC accounts in respect of which Infiniti Asset was an authorised intermediary (ie, it had been granted limited powers of attorney): (a) one of Mr Hong; (b) one of Mr Neo; and (c) one of Mr Fernandez. These accounts were opened between 10 and 20 May 2013. I should note that Infiniti Asset was also an authorised intermediary for two accounts of the Second Accused, one held with UBS and another with Julius Baer. These, however, will be addressed as part of Group 4 (see [637] below). The Prosecution’s case in respect of these three accounts was that both accused persons had conveyed trading instructions to Mr Phuah,

 The only Prosecution witness whose testimony was relevant to the control of all three accounts was Mr Phuah. Mr Hong’s evidence was relevant only to his own account, and neither Mr Neo nor Mr Fernandez gave evidence. However, for the reasons I have stated at [357]–[373] above, Mr Hong’s credit was impeached and I accordingly gave it little to no weight in respect of this account as well.543 I therefore focus on Mr Phuah’s evidence, which did not support the Prosecution’s case. On his account, he did not receive trading instructions from the accused persons, and he had exercised his own discretion in carrying out trades for the benefit of the accountholders. At most, he claimed, the accused persons, in particular, the First Accused, would have given him stock tips which he would have taken into consideration when deciding whether to place a trade.

 Of course, if I had, the finding would have been that the accused persons had not exercised such control. However, the difficulty I had with the Defence’s submission was that Mr Phuah’s position simply did not sit comfortably with the objective evidence.544 As a starting point, the First Accused had been involved in the opening of these three RBC accounts in May 2013 or, at the very least, he had been kept well-apprised of the opening of the accounts, the placement of collateral therein, and when they could be used to carry out trades. The individual who facilitated the opening of these three accounts was Mr Richard Chan. The messages he had exchanged with the First Accused were available (having been extracted from Mr Richard Chan’s mobile phone),

 Question (DPP Mr Teo): So here he keeps talking about “we can start using these accounts”. Who’s using the accounts?Answer (First Accused): I don’t know.Question (DPP Mr Teo): But, Mr Soh, these are messages sent to you and not just a single message, clearly, a number of messages pertaining to this RBC account of Mr Neo and Mr James.Answer (First Accused): Yes, you see, your Honour, I’m not quite sure he is telling me this in what context. One, this is a period where, having taken over ISR from Asiasons, Wira has just been made the executive chairman. He was trying to build business in this company, and this would be one of the initiatives. I believe Richard is wearing ISR hat here, trying to build up a ISR profit centre for fund management. It could be him informing me on -- as a conduit or as an alternative to reporting to Wira, as in, perhaps Wira has asked him to let me know how he’s doing on this building of this new division. Or he could be -- or he could be informing me of his progress with RBC and what they’re doing there. I’m not quite sure.Question (DPP Mr Teo): Okay, let’s just take the first possibility you mentioned. Just to clarify, when you say “having taken over ISR from Asiasons”, who took over ISR from Asiasons?Answer (First Accused): Sometime in, I can’t remember, I think 2012, Asiasons decided, at Tun Daim’s prompting, to hive off their 51 per cent control of Westcomb, the old stockbroking company called Westcomb, and Wira bought 20-odd per cent and did a demerging exercise with Asiasons, okay. So in doing so, they had to sell back some assets to Asiasons and rebuild ISR along new growth centres, and Richard and Steve Phuah was tasked with building up this new, what do you call that, fund management company, and they were trying to get -- to fill up their 250 million line, just like the way Cheng Jo-Ee was trying to fill up the 250 million lines. Meaning, limits under the licence.Question (DPP Mr Teo): All right, so this could be Mr Chan trying to rebuild ISR along new growth centres. And how does that explain why he would be updating you about Mr Hong and Mr Neo’s account?Answer (First Accused): Because -- yes, because I’m wearing the hat of Wira’s informal advisor there. Wira is now the executive chairman of ISR.Question (DPP Mr Teo): All right, and if it’s ISR -- I see, so you’re saying that Mr Neo’s account, Mr Hong’s account are just accounts to be managed by ISR. Is that what you’re saying?Answer (First Accused): I believe so, if my memory holds correct.…Question (DPP Mr Teo): So your evidence is it’s likely to be that this was -- he was updating you in your role as advisor to Dato Wira?Answer (First Accused): That is a possibility here.Question (DPP Mr Teo): Right, because of the -- and it’s about him building up ISR. Why is there a need for him to give you such detailed information about, you know, how much shares are needed before the line could be used?Answer (First Accused): I don’t know. Perhaps he wants to show that he’s doing his job to his chairman, or, as I said, perhaps he wants me to push Neo and to quickly activate. Because from the first date that he said -- from the first day he said he met RBC, and that was on 10 April, it looks like it’s more than a month before things actually get started. So I don’t know, I can only speculate, your Honour.Question (DPP Mr Teo): So even though these messages were sent to you, you’re giving us a universe of possibilities, speculation. You can’t remember, that’s what you’re saying?Answer (First Accused): I cannot remember.[emphasis added in bold italics]548 For additional context, “ISR” refers to ISR Capital, which was the parent company of Infiniti Asset.

 As the First Accused stated, Dato Wira was the Executive Chairman of ISR Capital; he was also a Non-Executive Director of LionGold and a Director of Magnus Energy.

 549 However, even assuming that the First Accused’s explanation was accurate (bearing in mind that, by his own admission, the explanation was not one he remembered definitively, but was rather a mere “possibility”), none of this context lent his evidence any weight. The messages Mr Richard Chan had sent made no mention of Dato Wira, nor did their tone or choice of words suggest that the First Accused was anything akin to a “conduit” either to Dato Wira or any of the Relevant Accountholders in issue. On the contrary, the words used, in my view, clearly indicated that the content of the messages were for the First Accused directly. Indeed, the messages also made logical sense in the wider context of the evidence given by various TRs that the accused persons had frequently been on the lookout for access to more trading facilities (on this, see [730]–[735] below).550 Therefore, I rejected the First Accused’s explanation of Mr Richard Chan’s text messages to him on the RBC accounts. In my judgment, they suggested that the First Accused had been involved with the establishment and use of the three accounts in a manner which was suspicious. This suggestion, in turn, begged three questions in respect of each RBC account. First, apart from Mr Richard Chan’s messages to the First Accused, was there other objective evidence that fell within the same vein in so far as the First Accused had been concerned. Second, what was to be made of Mr Phuah’s testimony in the face of such objective evidence. Third, what did the evidence reveal about the Second Accused’s involvement with the accounts (if any).551 As regards the first question, the objective evidence showed that a substantial volume of BAL and InnoPac shares had been assigned to Mr Hong and Mr Neo’s CDP accounts and these were, in turn, transferred into Mr Hong and Mr Neo’s RBC accounts as collateral for share financing.

 The shares stemmed from the CDP accounts of various other Relevant Accountholders; specifically, Mr Chen, Mr Lee CH, Mr Lim KY, Mr Ong KL, Mr Richard Ooi, and Mr Sim CK.552 In respect of Mr Hong’s CDP and RBC accounts, the following sets of assignments and transfers for Blumont, Asiasons, LionGold and InnoPac shares were relevant.

 554 Where Mr Fernandez’s account had been concerned, the picture which emerged from the CDP securities movement records, admittedly, was slightly less clear-cut. Indeed, I should highlight that in its written closing, the Prosecution did not carry out the work of tracing through the relevant CDP records for Mr Fernandez’s account and, accordingly, did not rely on evidence of this nature.

 That said, my own review of the underlying records showed that, prior to transfers being made into Mr Fernandez’s RBC account, like the case with Mr Hong and Mr Neo’s accounts, his CDP account had also received substantial assignments of Blumont, Asiasons and InnoPac shares. The only salient difference is that such assignments had been received from both Relevant Accountholders as well as an unidentified accountholder.(a) On 3 July 2013, 6,500,000 InnoPac shares had been assigned from Ms Lim SH’s CDP account to Mr Fernandez’s CDP account.

 555 These series of assignments and transfers by themselves, raised questions. Moreover, the peculiarity of the share movements did not stand alone. The messages reproduced at [544] above certainly related to at least some of these transfers. First, Mr Richard Chan’s message dated 17 May 2013 at 4.18.11pm matched the assignments and transfers of Asiasons, LionGold and InnoPac shares made to and from Mr Hong’s CDP account (see [552(b)], [552(c)] and [552(d)] above).

 Second, the timing of the transfers of Asiasons and InnoPac shares into Mr Fernandez’s RBC account (see [554(a)] above) also broadly corresponded with Mr Richard Chan’s message to the First Accused dated 18 July 2013 at 3.49.19pm.

 In fact, Mr Richard Chan’s message that RBC was not accepting any further Blumont shares as collateral because Mr Fernandez’s portfolio already comprised 60% Blumont shares also made sense in light of the substantial 25,000,000 Blumont shares that had been deposited into Mr Fernandez’s CDP account in May 2013 (see [554(b)] above). 556 The fact that the First Accused had been kept apprised of these assignments and transfers at all strongly suggested that he had been involved in some capacity. As to what that capacity had been, I found that this was revealed by the language of Mr Richard Chan’s messages. In particular, the following message segment: “… James is all ready pending transfer of shares. Am quite sure I can increase their lines quite fast to $40 million each once we start using” [emphasis added].

 In my view, the answer was clear – Mr Richard Chan used the words “we” and “use” because that is exactly what he had meant. “We” referred to some group which included the First Accused, and “use” meant that such group could use the RBC accounts to place trades. This, in turn, strongly implied that this group had made arrangements to place BAL and InnoPac shares in these three accounts as collateral. After all, it was wholly logical that the parties “using” the accounts would be the ones taking the necessary steps to set it up for such use.557 Beyond the foregoing, there was more objective evidence that supported the conclusion that the First Accused had been involved in the use of Mr Hong and Mr Fernandez’s accounts. As regards Mr Hong’s account, the fact of the First Accused’s involvement could also be gathered from post-Crash messages the two had exchanged between January and February 2014:

More generally, he denied the natural import of the messages but did not provide any convincing explanation for why Mr Hong had been raising these issues with him at all.

 In my view, this was a fatal failing on the First Accused’s part. The fact that such messages had been sent at all called for a proper explanation, at the very least, as to specific nature of the First Accused’s involvement with the accounts mentioned, including Mr Hong’s RBC account. Absent such an explanation, the natural inference to which the messages gave rise – in conjunction with the other evidence set out above – was that Mr Hong had been seeking to hold the First Accused responsible for the post-Crash losses suffered in the accounts because it was the First Accused who had used those accounts in the first place.559 Where Mr Fernandez’s account was concerned, a private conversation between the First Accused and Ms Cheng shed light on how the First Accused viewed the account as well as Mr Phuah’s role in relation to that account (the context and nature of this conversation is explained at [775] below). The salient portions were these:

Steve Phuah is my man.Ms Cheng: Steve Phuah?First Accused: Steve Phuah is loyal to me…560 The First Accused sought to explain this description of Mr Phuah as part of a heated conversation between himself and Ms Cheng regarding their romantic relationship and consequent quarrel over his continued romantic relationship with the Second Accused. Specifically, that he was saying anything he could to placate Ms Cheng into ending the conversation.

 I did not, however, accept this. It was hardly believable that the First Accused could and would, have concocted such a specific point about Mr Phuah’s loyalty, just to minimise the Second Accused’s connection with certain Relevant Accounts (the Second Accused’s sister being Mr Phuah’s superior in Infiniti Asset).561 There was no evidence which gave such direct insight into how the First Accused had viewed Mr Neo’s RBC account. However, the BAL shares represented an unusually high percentage of all the equities traded by the three RBC accounts during the Relevant Period. In respect of Mr Hong’s account, that percentage was 75.25%. For Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez’s accounts, respectively, the percentages were 90.25% and 88.76%.

 This, more generally, suggested to me that all three accounts had been used for the same purpose as the other Relevant Accounts which had been controlled by the accused persons (ie, those within Groups 1 and 2 discussed above). And, when considered alongside Mr Richard Chan’s messages to the First Accused, the peculiar sequence of assignments and transfers set out at [552]–[554] above, the messages exchanged between the First Accused and Mr Hong, as well as the conversation between the First Accused and Ms Cheng, the irresistible inference was that these accounts had been controlled by, at least, the First Accused.562 The GovTech Evidence corroborated this inference. The Accused Persons’ Analysis showed that 100%, 75% and 100% of Blumont orders entered in Mr Hong, Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez’s accounts, respectively, had been preceded by proximate communications between the First Accused and Mr Phuah.

 Where the First Accused was concerned, the hit-rate for LionGold orders was relatively low – 18.8%, 19.5% and 10.3%. This, however, was wholly consistent with the evidence of TRs who testified that the Second Accused was typically the individual who had instructed trades for LionGold shares, and the First Accused typically did so for Blumont and Asiasons shares (eg, see the evidence of Mr Lincoln Lee at [346(c)] above). True to this, the hit-rates for LionGold orders were noticeably higher where the Second Accused was concerned: 62.5% for Mr Hong’s account, 46.3% for Mr Neo’s account, and 72.4% for Mr Fernandez’s account.

 563 This brings me to the second question framed at [550] above what to make of Mr Phuah’s testimony in light of all the objective evidence set out in the preceding paragraphs. To reiterate, Mr Phuah claimed that he did not take instructions from the First Accused. Instead, he said that he had only received stock “tips” from the First Accused, which he would take into consideration when making his own decisions on behalf of Infiniti Asset as the authorised intermediary.

 or even what the First Accused’s “tips” had been based on (eg, personal knowledge, instinct, research, etc). Indeed, as regards this last matter, Mr Phuah admitted that he had not even asked the First Accused if the tips were ‘good’, so to speak.

 However, he defined “standing instructions” as “an instruction relayed by the client with regards to a particular stock and it stands until it [is] cancelled”. For example, he suggested a client would say, “I [would] like to buy 10 million shares of… LionGold at market, or if you can, better”.

 However, when it was suggested to Mr Phuah that the pattern of calls and trades seemed “more consistent with [the] communications being instructions specifying a counter, a specific quantity and a specific price rather than being a general tip which [he] would then have to go and research”, Mr Phuah revealed the character of the First Accused’s “tips”.

Answer (Mr Phuah): No, it’s -- I -- I disagree with you, Mr Tan. It -- it is a stock tip, and it’s a stock tip could be saying that there is a price, there is an amount, and you can sort of, like, execute the orders during that time. And we are -- when you are referring to Mr Fernandez’s account, like I said yesterday in my evidence, I mentioned that he gave me standing instructions.Question (DPP Mr Tan): You just said the stock tip could be saying there’s a price and an amount. What do you mean by that?…Answer (Mr Phuah): Sorry?Question (DPP Mr Tan): You just said a stock tip could be saying that there’s a price, there’s an amount and you can sort of like execute the orders during that time. … What do you mean by that?Answer (Mr Phuah): There is probably, like, say, for example, a million -- a million shares available on the -- on the sell side, and you probably want to -- to execute the trade based on the number of sellers out in the market right now.Question (DPP Mr Tan): Are you saying that these sort of what you call tips from Mr John Soh could be such that he tells you a price and the quantity to buy?Answer (Mr Phuah): I cannot remember for certainty.565 I found it rather too convenient that Mr Phuah could, in one moment, state what he meant by a “stock tip”, and in the very next, claim that he could not remember exactly what details the First Accused’s “tips” would have typically contained. The foregoing difficulties with Mr Phuah’s testimony made clear that he was simply not a witness of the truth on this point. In my view, he was well aware the First Accused had not given him stock tips, but rather plain trading instructions. He let “slip” that the First Accused’s supposed stock “tips” resembled instructions because the notion of a genuine “tip”, simply could not account for the picture painted by the objective evidence as regards how Mr Phuah had communicated with the First Accused and consequently traded in the RBC accounts. Therefore, Mr Phuah’s explanation needed to, in a non-committal manner, vary the characteristics of the First Accused’s stock “tips” to accommodate the objective evidence. In so doing, however, Mr Phuah essentially revealed that the First Accused’s communications had been trading instructions.566 In my judgment, this revelation, considered alongside the objective evidence (set out from [544]–[560] above) as well as the GovTech Evidence (see [562] above), led inescapably to the conclusion that the First Accused had controlled the RBC accounts of Mr Hong, Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez. He had done so by giving BAL trading instructions to Mr Phuah, who would act on those instructions. 567 This brings me, finally, to the third question framed at [550] above and the Second Accused’s role in relation to these three accounts. As stated at [542] above, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Second Accused had also instructed Mr Phuah. I found that this had clearly been made out. On this, three points are salient:(a) First, Mr Phuah stated that the Second Accused had also called him frequently to give him stock tips. However, he could not even maintain this position, eventually stating that she had instead given him constant price updates in respect of various shares as a way of telling him that she had been on a “winning streak”.

 In my view, even putting aside Mr Phuah’s inability to keep a straight story, the Prosecution was right in characterising his latter explanation as “nonsensical”.

 (b) Second, as with the First Accused, there were clear instances of telecommunications between the Second Accused and Mr Phuah which preceded the placement of LionGold orders in the three RBC accounts. For example, on 11 June 2013 between 3.54.00pm and 4.00.46pm, a series of six LionGold orders had been entered in Mr Fernandez’s account. The first three orders were preceded by a call from the Second Accused, and the next three were preceded by one call each.

 This strongly implied a connection between the calls and the orders placed, and, in my view, given the character of the First Accused’s involvement with the accounts, called for an explanation from the Second Accused. (c) Third, without the Second Accused’s explanation to distinguish between the character of hers and the First Accused’s involvement with the accounts, the natural adverse inference from the available evidence was that she had also exercised control over the three RBC accounts. I found that she did so in the same manner as the First Accused – by calling Mr Phuah to communicate her instructions – though, as stated at [562] above, the evidence revealed that she chiefly did so in respect of LionGold shares, and not Blumont or Asiasons.568 In summary, although Mr Phuah’s evidence did not directly support the Prosecution’s case, I found that he was not a witness of the whole truth and that the objective evidence analysed with aspects of Mr Phuah’s testimony showed that the accused persons had exercised control over the RBC accounts of Mr Hong, Mr Neo, and Mr Fernandez. Neither accused person was properly authorised to exercise such control, and, when this was seen alongside the fact that the three accounts traded very heavily in BAL shares (see [560] above), there were ample grounds to infer that the accounts had formed part of some common scheme being perpetuated by the accused persons during the Relevant Period.(2) Three accounts managed by Stamford Management569 Stamford Management was a company in the business of private wealth management.

 This, however, was a technical distinction stated purely for accuracy. Practically, all three accounts had been managed by Mr William Chan personally.570 The Prosecution’s case as regards these three accounts differed slightly. For Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account and Mr Ooi’s Credit Suisse account, their case was that only the Second Accused had given trading instructions directly to Mr William Chan, who would act on those instructions by calling the FIs’ trading desk to place the instructed order. In respect of Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account, their case was that both accused persons had given trading instructions to Mr William Chan. In addition, the Second Accused had also relayed instructions to Mr William Chan through Mr Hong, and the First Accused had also relayed instructions through Mr Nicholas Ng.

 571 Mr William Chan testified to the establishment and use of all three accounts. Mr Hong’s evidence, notwithstanding that I found his credit to have been impeached (see [371] above), was naturally relevant to both his accounts. Mr Nicholas Ng was also called as a witness and his evidence was relevant to Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account. Like Mr Hong, however, the Prosecution also applied to impeach his credit. I will first state how Mr William Chan came to be associated with the accused persons through Mr Chen, and Mr William Chan’s evidence more generally. Thereafter, I will turn to the specifics for each of the three accounts in issue. 572 To begin, Mr Chen testified that from sometime in 2010, the First Accused began “consistently” asking his associates to “look for margin lines with BAL shares as collateral”. This was so that the First Accused could “load up” on BAL shares. In this context, “many people” had been referred to Mr Chen to “present their proposals on possible share margin financing arrangements with BAL shares as collateral”. Mr William Chan was one of them, and they met sometime in early or mid-2012.

 Upon meeting, Mr Chen informed Mr William Chan that he had friends who were interested in asset management. In response, Mr William Chan indicated that Stamford Management would be able to assist them in opening accounts with private banks to manage their wealth. Thereafter, in August 2012, arrangements were made for the Second Accused, Mr Hong, and Mr Billy Ooi to meet Mr William Chan.

On this, Mr William Chan said:

 … they told me that what they wanted was to obtain share margin financing for the shares in [Asiasons] and Blumont shares (sic) that they held, and to buy shares in LionGold with the financing obtained. Specifically, [Mr Hong] wanted to use Asiasons shares as collateral to buy LionGold shares. [Mr Billy Ooi] wanted to use Asiasons and Blumont shares as collateral to buy LionGold shares.I initially suggested to [the Second Accused], [Mr Hong] and [Mr Billy Ooi] a financing arrangement that UBS proposed. They told me that they did not wish to take up this product, because it would involve selling their Asiasons and Blumont shares, which they did not wish to do. They wanted to hold on to their Asiasons and Blumont shares.574 After this meeting, Mr William Chan was introduced to Mr Nicholas Ng by Mr Chen. Thereafter, around September or October 2012, Mr William Chan was also introduced to the First Accused, whom he met around five more times subsequently.

 Notably, Mr William Chan stated that on the occasions he had met the First Accused, the latter often asked him about the financing he had procured for the Second Accused, Mr Hong, and Mr Billy Ooi. The First Accused would ask about how the financing worked, and in particular, “whether the banks were going to sell the shares that had been provided to it as collateral”. The First Accused also “wanted to know whether any other banks were willing to accept Blumont, Asiasons or LionGold shares as collateral for lending”.

Pursuant to the meeting with the Second Accused, Mr Hong and Mr Billy Ooi, around September or October 2012, Mr William Chan managed to obtain Credit Suisse’s agreement to extend financing to Mr Hong. By this, Credit Suisse agreed to finance the purchase of up to 8,000,000 LionGold shares if 13,500,000 Asiasons shares were to be deposited as collateral.

In respect of William Chan, it was clear from the evidence that the Accused Persons were not the ones who initiated any of the activities in these accounts. William Chan was brought in to meet Nicholas Ng by Peter Chen and they had a mentor-mentee type of relationship. William Chan was the prime mover of the Goldman Sachs lines, and appeared to be taking guidance from Nicholas on many matters. It was Peter Chen who arranged for a lunch between William Chan, the 2nd Accused, Billy Ooi and James Hong, following which William arranged facilities for them with Credit Suisse.Further, the 1st Accused had given evidence that both the 2nd Accused and James Hong had agreed with the portfolio from Goldman Sachs, and then William Chan and Nicholas Ng rushed them to fill up the accounts while James Hong was overseas or busy. As such, the 2nd Accused had to help with the filling-up process. This was certainly not market manipulation.[footnotes omitted]578 These submissions were vague and unclear, but from what I gathered, the Defence was either suggesting: (a) that Mr Chen, Mr Nicholas Ng and Mr William Chan had been the real users of Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account (and, indeed, Mr Billy Ooi’s Credit Suisse account as well as Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account); or (b) that the two accountholders had been the source of all account-opening arrangements and trading instructions. Separately, the second part of the submission seemed to be an explanation for why the Second Accused had been involved at all, namely, that she had been helping Mr Hong “fill up” his Goldman Sachs account whilst he was busy or away. I rejected these contentions. First of all, these positions failed entirely to engage with the objective evidence of the First Accused’s involvement in the establishment of this account (see [575] above), or the evidence of Mr William Chan against the Second Accused. Second, I found Mr William Chan’s evidence fairly straightforward. If it had been the Defence’s case that he was lying about the Second Accused’s involvement, in any of these three accounts, they needed to have made that point much more clearly when he was on the stand.579 I was presented with no reason to doubt Mr William Chan’s testimony, and the Second Accused’s election to remain silent certainly did not assist the Defence’s case in this regard. Indeed, beyond the fact that Mr William Chan’s evidence largely went unchallenged, the veracity of his account (independent of whether it had been challenged or not) was, in my judgment, bolstered by a few other pieces of objective evidence. 580 First, there was evidence from which it could be inferred that the accused persons had relayed trading instructions to Mr William Chan through Mr Hong. For example, on 16 October 2012, Mr Hong received a call from the LionGold meeting room at 3.02pm.

 At 3.12.49pm, this buy order was duly entered in Mr Hong’s account. As it was entered one tick above the best ask of S$1.07, the order instantly traded to completion. Notably, 182,000 of the 800,000 LionGold shares bought came from Mr Leroy Lau. Another 294,000 had been purchased from ITE Electric’s account with Phillip Securities (under the management of Mr Tjoa), and 303,000 had been purchased from Mr Lim KY’s account with DMG & Partners (under the management of Mr Gan). Accordingly, only 21,000 shares had been purchased from non-Relevant Accounts.

 While there was no information about the contents of the call at 3.02pm, the striking alignment of these accounts’ trades was indicative of a degree of coordination (indeed, for the reasons I will set out from [648]–[726] below, I found that the Relevant Accounts under Mr Tjoa and Mr Gan’s management had been controlled by the accused persons in connection with some broader scheme).581 Second, the First Accused and Mr Hong also exchanged several text messages which showed them discussing trading activity in Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account. For example, on 10 December 2012 at around 4.10pm, Mr Hong wrote to the First Accused, “Dato, wrt the CS trade, tks”. A few minutes later, the First Accused responded, “We clear all tomorro[w].. Can?” And, less than a minute later, Mr Hong then replied, “K”.

 While more context was certainly needed to understand the story behind this exchange, it nevertheless revealed that beyond the First Accused’s initial involvement in securing collateral to be placed in Mr Hong’s account (see [575] above), Mr Hong continued to discuss trading matters relating to this account with the First Accused. 582 Another exchange was salient. On 19 December 2012, close to noon, Mr Hong wrote: “Dato, the shares from CS is back into my cdp a/c”, “There’s also bal cash of abt 300k, they r finalizing the figure and shld transfer out by today”.

 had been transferred from Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account to his CDP account. For some reason, he regarded it necessary to keep the First Accused apprised of this transfer and, most revealingly, he then took the First Accused’s instructions as regards what to do with those transferred shares. This supported the inference that the First Accused had control over Mr Hong’s account with Credit Suisse, at the very least.583 Third, the available text message records showed that Mr Nicholas Ng had in fact conveyed trading instructions to Mr William Chan. The following messages had been exchanged between Mr William Chan and Mr Nicholas Ng, and the CAD verified that these messages had resulted in orders being placed and trades being executed in Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account:

 If accepted, Mr Nicholas Ng’s account was plainly inculpatory of the First Accused. Thus, the question was whether his evidence ought to have been accepted. 585 On this note, I turn to the Prosecution’s own application to impeach his credit. For clarity’s sake, I should state that Mr Nicholas Ng was plainly not a wholly hostile witness. As stated in the paragraph immediately above, his account as to why he had been conveying trading instructions to Mr William Chan was obviously in line with the Prosecution’s case.

 Mr Nicholas Ng did, however, depart from certain positions he had taken in his investigative statements, most notably in respect of his knowledge of the First Accused’s broader plan in respect of Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold (see [853]–[869] below, particularly, [867]–[868]). Relying on this and 11 other areas of inconsistency, the Prosecution applied to impeach Mr Nicholas Ng’s credibility and, in so doing, sought to have portions of four of his investigation statements

 be admitted as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. 586 I did not, however, ultimately think that this application was productive, and I do not propose to deal with it in any detail. To begin, the Prosecution accepted that in relation to ten of the 12 areas of inconsistency raised, upon being cross-examined on these inconsistencies, Mr Nicholas Ng either fully or partially adopted the positions he had taken in his investigation statements. In respect of the areas which Mr Nicholas Ng confirmed the contents of his investigation statements in full, I did not consider it necessary to rely on the contents of the investigation statements at all. It sufficed for me to reject the portions of his testimony inconsistent with the contents of his statements. 587 More generally, I did not think Mr Nicholas Ng was an uncreditworthy witness. He was quite ill when he took the stand. On the first day Mr Nicholas Ng gave evidence, he could barely make it through half a day of the trial in the courtroom. Thereafter, the parties agreed to the Prosecution’s suggestion to allow him to testify via video-link from his home (with certain safeguards in place). Even so, he had difficulties focusing for long periods, and frequent breaks had to be given for him to rest and compose himself. Indeed, he was irritable, and his answers were often brief. For those areas where he eventually agreed fully or partially with the contents of the investigation statements, I attributed his original answers, which were short, unhelpful and terse to his physical and mental state. I did not think that they formed the basis for impeaching his credit. Indeed, for some of these areas, the Prosecution did not even press him to explain further when he accepted the versions in the investigation statements. For the two areas where he did not accept the contents of the statements, I found that the discrepancies were not material and they did not, in my view, support the conclusion that his credibility had been impeached. I accordingly found it appropriate to accept Mr Nicholas Ng’s evidence with appropriate regard to his initial inconsistencies. 588 Thus, on the basis of Mr Nicholas Ng and Mr William Chan’s testimonies, the objective evidence set out at [575] and [579]–[583] above, and the lack of an answer by the Second Accused (in respect of which I adversely inferred that no explanation could be furnished to account for Mr William Chan’s allegations against her), I was satisfied: (a) that Mr Hong had allowed the Second Accused to exercise control his account with Credit Suisse by giving instructions directly to Mr William Chan; and (b) that the First Accused had additionally exercised control by relaying instructions to Mr William Chan through Mr Nicholas Ng as well as Mr Hong. On these bases, I found that Mr Hong’s account with Credit Suisse had been controlled by both accused persons. As explained at [508]–[517] above in relation to the accounts within Group 1, the fact of the accused persons’ informal, concealed control was sufficient to infer that the account had been used in connection with some broader purpose. However, this inference was solidified by the fact that the account traded exclusively in BAL shares.

589 This brings me to the next account within this subgroup – that of Mr Billy Ooi with Credit Suisse. In late October 2012, Mr William Chan also managed to secure Credit Suisse’s agreement to provide a similar share financing arrangement to Mr Billy Ooi. By this agreement, Credit Suisse was prepared to finance the purchase of up to 8,230,000 LionGold shares on the collateral of 6,726,500 Asiasons shares and 43,166,000 Blumont shares.

 The next day, pursuant to the financing agreement, 6,726,000 Asiasons shares were deposited into Mr Billy Ooi’s account. On 16 November 2012, 43,166,000 Blumont shares were deposited as well.

 Though there was no direct evidence like that set out at [575] above, demonstrating the First Accused’s role in the placement of collateral in this account, there was objective evidence from which this could be inferred. On 29 October 2012, prior to the account being opened, Mr William Chan sent an email with Credit Suisse’s proposed portfolio construction and Mr Billy Ooi forwarded this to the First Accused.

 There was simply no reason for the First Accused to be given this information, and, when read alongside [575], it could be inferred that the First Accused had also made arrangements for the collateral that was deposited in Mr Billy Ooi’s account.590 As regards the usage of this account, Mr William Chan testified that the Second Accused had been the one to instruct the majority, if not all, of the orders that had been placed in the account.

 A telling series of messages which corroborated Mr William Chan’s testimony, were those he had exchanged with Mr Nicholas Ng concerning “Billy’s line”. In particular, on 21 November 2012, at around 10.00am, the former sent a message to the latter saying, “John called. Apparently will execute trade via Su Ling?” Shortly after, Mr Nicholas Ng responded, “Yes she will call u for trade instructions”.

 591 Another revealing fact, in my view, was Mr William Chan’s evidence regarding a meeting which took place in February 2013 between himself, Mr Hong and the accused persons at LionGold’s office. At the time, Credit Suisse had decided that it was no longer able to offer margin financing facilities on the collateral of BAL shares and, thus, the four had met to discuss what to do. Very pertinently, the group discussed Mr Billy Ooi’s account even though he had not been at the meeting.

 Ultimately, after Credit Suisse terminated the financing agreement, and counters in Mr Billy Ooi’s account needed to be sold, the verification work carried out by the Prosecution (see [81] above) in respect of trading and communications data strongly supported the inference that the accused persons had coordinated the sale of those counters.

Moreover, given that her control was informal and had been concealed from Credit Suisse,

 coupled with the fact that the account traded only in BAL shares, I also found that it had been pulled into some scheme being run by the accused persons.593 Finally, I turn to the third account within this subgroup that being Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account.

 This account had been opened on 28 February 2013, in the thick of the Relevant Period. This was because, on Mr William Chan’s evidence, it was the termination of the share financing facilities by Credit Suisse that led directly to the opening of Mr Hong as well as the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs accounts (on the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs account, see [637]–[647] below).

Opening of [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] and [Mr Hong’s (“JH”)] [Goldman Sachs (“GS”)] accountsFollowing the meeting with [the First Accused (“JS”)] [this meeting references to that mentioned at [591] above], QSL and JH, I approached GS. I spoke with one Tan Bong Loo (“TBL”) of GS and his team. I showed him and his team JH’s CS portfolio, to show him the kind of financing we had obtained from CS and to see if GS could offer similar margin financing using Asiasons shares as collateral.Sometime before GS agreed to extend financing, I recall that JS called me to ask about the progress of securing margin financing from GS.Sometime in February, GS expressed interest in extending financing to purchase LionGold shares based on Asiasons shares as collateral. On 13 February, TBL emailed me a table to suggest an initial portfolio. …On 25 February 2013, I emailed QSL an updated version of the table showing what GS was prepared to agree to. … It was the understanding of the parties that the initial collateral to be provided to GS would be Asiasons shares, and that the margin financing provided would be used to buy LionGold shares and bond funds (although this agreement was not documented formally as part of the account opening).On 25 February 2013, QSL’s account was opened with GS. … I was authorised to place trade orders for her account on her behalf. On 28 February 2013, JH’s account was opened with GS. … Similarly, I was authorised to place trade orders for his account on his behalf.A total of 21.7 million Asiasons shares were transferred into QSL’s GS account as collateral in March 2013. … A total of 22.3 million Asiasons shares were transferred into JH’s GS account in March 2013. …594 As with Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account (see [575] above), the First Accused made arrangements for the initial collateral deposited in the accounts.

 Much like the series of assignments described at [552]–[555] above in relation to the RBC accounts of Mr Hong, Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez, the collateral that had been assigned to Mr Hong’s CDP account in this instance, also came from the CDP accounts of other Relevant Accountholders.

This alone, strongly supported the inference that the accounts had been controlled by the accused persons. However, quite apart from this, there was also the direct testimony of Mr William Chan who testified that it had been the Second Accused who gave most, if not all the trading instructions in respect of Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account (indeed, she also did so for her own Goldman Sachs account).

601 As a preface, I should state that the evidence available in respect of two of these accounts, the Credit Suisse accounts of Ms Cheng and Alethia Capital, was not nearly as clear as that put forth in respect of other Relevant Accounts. These evidential issues did not exist in respect of three accounts belonging to Alethia Elite, which I deal with first. 602 As noted at [423] above, Ms Cheng readily admitted that the three accounts held by Alethia Elite had indeed been made available to the accused persons to place BAL trades. In response, the First Accused made the following, somewhat bare submission:

 For these accounts [referring to all five accounts being discussed in this subsection as well as Ms Cheng’s account with CIMB discussed above], Cheng Jo-Ee had given evidence that for any account owned by her late father or herself, the 1st Accused did not give instructions. Cheng Jo-Ee also confirmed that the ultimate beneficial owners of these accounts were her father, Cheng Wah, and herself. It is also telling that she (and the 1st Accused) deliberately concealed these accounts from the 2nd Accused. The truth of the matter is clearly that the 1st Accused was giving trading advice to his girlfriend for her to make money. In the premises, there was no deception on the part of the Accused Persons for these accounts either.[footnotes omitted]603 This submission did not cut ice. The communications between the First Accused and Ms Cheng made readily apparent that the First Accused had given BAL trading instructions in respect of the two UBS accounts. I set out some of the text messages exchanged between the First Accused and Ms Cheng which were illustrative. I should emphasise, however, that the messages reproduced below only represents a selection of the extensive exchanges between them,

Nothing about the character of these messages showed that the First Accused had been giving “trading advice to his girlfriend for her to make money”. Accordingly, I found that the First Accused had exercised control over these two accounts. 605 Next, Alethia Elite’s account with Coutts. Unlike Alethia Elite’s two accounts with UBS discussed above, the Prosecution did not have text messages exchanged between the First Accused and Ms Cheng which showed directly that the former had exercised control. However, there was more than ample evidence to support Ms Cheng’s admission that the account had been made available to the First Accused to place BAL trades.

I don’t really care. But today Clifford chance just sent me email: Coutts deeply concerned how directors managed elite’s assets.

We didn’t goto court last 3 times, saying that there’s no need since elite will be wound up tomoro. RT told CC that there’s a mastermind behind all these & CC should not windup elite but insist on examining directors too. What excuse/ defense shd Rabi tell judge tomoro, to convince him to windup elite?(b) Second, Mr Chen gave evidence on an incident which had taken place on 27 September 2013, where the First Accused had instructed him to transfer millions of BAL shares to Mr Cheng Wah’s CDP account.

 There was obviously nothing inherently suspicious about trading heavily in certain counters.

 that Ms Cheng had instructed her to prepare and maintain a spreadsheet that tracked the BAL shareholdings of Alethia Elite’s accounts as well as those under the management of Alethia Asset (to which I will turn at [617] below).

 In line with that which I stated at [606] above, this suggested that the account had controlled by the accused persons. I am mindful that the buy order on 8 February 2013 for 500,000 LionGold shares was the only trade which the objective evidence could link to an instruction stemming from the accused persons (in this case, the First Accused). This was despite the fact that the TCFB records of messages exchanged between the accused persons and Ms Cheng were very comprehensive.

 It was therefore not the case that the account had been used extensively. The minimal trading instructions correlated to an equally low usage rate. Given this, despite Ms Cheng’s denial that this account had been made available for the accused persons’ use, I found that the messages set out at [608] above were a sufficient basis to conclude that both accused persons had controlled this account in so far as BAL trades had been concerned (though, for precision, I should note that this account did not trade in Blumont, only Asiasons and LionGold). However, it should be noted that I was only barely satisfied that the account had been controlled. 611 On that note, it is appropriate to explain that, in urging me to reach this conclusion, the Prosecution relied heavily on the general evidence which they said, showed that the accused persons and Ms Cheng had a general understanding that all the latter’s accounts (including those of Alethia Elite, Alethia Capital, and under the management of Alethia Asset), would be available for the accused persons’ use if necessary.

 I rejected this submission in reaching my finding that the account had been controlled.612 Although I could appreciate their point, it was slightly heavy-handed. Granted, the fact that Ms Cheng appeared to have made available her accounts, and did not seem to draw any distinction between them (at the material time, rather than in court) suggested that there was something illegitimate about their arrangement. Such an arrangement was patently abnormal and supported the view that the accused persons’ modus operandi was to gather as many accounts as they could to conduct the BAL trades they needed to, to effect their larger objective. Irrespective of whether the accused persons had actually used each individual account, the fact that they had made such arrangement with Ms Cheng at all, was suggestive of illegitimate behaviour. 613 To the Prosecution’s credit, I accepted that this went towards supporting the bigger picture of their case. However, where this specific account was concerned, the Prosecution was essentially inviting me to conclude from this rather general basis that the accused persons could be said, as a matter of fact, to have controlled each and every specific account Ms Cheng had, regardless of whether there was proof of the accused persons actually using that account. I did not accept that this inference was tenable, especially given my finding that Ms Cheng was candid about the accused persons’ use of many other accounts. In my view, the conclusion that a specific account had been controlled by the accused persons needed more than this general understanding. 614 Where, as in the case of Ms Cheng’s account with CIMB (see [420]–[427] above), there had not been any BAL trades which could be traced to instructions from the accused persons, and Ms Cheng denied that the account had been made available to them, there was in my view, insufficient basis to reach the conclusion that the accused persons had controlled such account. Where Alethia Capital’s Credit Suisse account was concerned, the clearly evidenced instance of a trading instruction being given by the First Accused with the Second Accused’s knowledge (see [608] above) was sufficient to tip the scales in favour of finding that the accused persons had controlled this account. 615 However, this was not the case where Ms Cheng’s personal account with Credit Suisse was concerned. I did not find that Ms Cheng’s personal Credit Suisse account had been controlled by the accused persons. Like her account with CIMB, there was no evidence to show that the accused persons had actually used the account. Given Ms Cheng’s denial that this account had been made available to accused persons, it was not proven that, if they had insisted upon a trade in Ms Cheng’s personal Credit Suisse account, she would have obliged. 616 In summary, though I was satisfied that Alethia Elite’s three accounts with UBS and Coutts had been controlled by the First Accused, and Alethia Capital’s one account with Credit Suisse had been controlled by both accused persons, there was not enough evidence to reach that conclusion in respect of Ms Cheng’s personal account with Credit Suisse.

 On receiving either accused persons’ instructions, Ms Cheng would then place their instructed orders with the FIs. 619 Ms Cheng and Ms Ivy Tan were the two prosecution witnesses who were relevant in respect of these nine accounts. However, my analysis will not centre on their evidence. Instead, it will focus on the objective evidence and proceed as follows.(a) First, I will set out messages exchanged between the accused persons and Ms Cheng which directly evidenced trading instructions being given by either the First or Second Accused to Ms Cheng.(b) Second, it will touch on the messages exchanged between Ms Cheng and the authorised signatories of the four corporate Relevant Accountholders, particularly, the absence of trading instructions.(c) Lastly, it will set out and address the Defence’s submissions and evidence in respect of these nine accounts. Ms Cheng’s evidence, which favoured the Defence, will also be dealt with.620 First off, I note that the TCFB was able to extract a substantial number of text messages exchanged between the First Accused and Ms Cheng. A review of these messages showed that there were many instances where the First Accused had given Ms Cheng trading instructions which resulted in BAL orders being entered in one of the Alethia Asset Accounts.

621 These messages very plainly reflected instructions. Indeed, they may be likened to the messages the First Accused had sent to Mr Hong (see, eg, [358] above). Mr Hong sought to characterise those messages as “stock tips”, but that was entirely contrived (see [359] above). Similarly, the foregoing messages the accused persons had exchanged with Ms Cheng could not, in my judgment, be fairly explained in any other way. 622 Another critical point of note was that these messages had not specified the particular account in which the accused persons wished for a trade to be placed. This was salient because, as would have been gathered from above (see, eg, [379]), a recurring theme in the First Accused’s defence was that he had not given trading instructions but rather trading advice or stock tips to help his family and friends make money on the stock market.

 This was plausible and could have been borne out by messages which used the language expected of stock tips. Necessarily, this must have included, at the very least, information about the account in respect of which the tip was being given. However, that was not what his messages to Ms Cheng revealed. The messages showed that the First Accused simply stated trading details without reference to any account, and it seemed that Ms Cheng was left to choose the account in which the order was to be placed from any of these accounts. This was consistent with the evidence given by other TRs (see, eg, [236] and [463] above) and did not, in my view, accord with any potentially legitimate arrangement.623 This then begged the question of how the accused persons as well as Ms Cheng generally regarded the Alethia Asset Accounts. A telling message which sheds light on this question had been sent by Ms Cheng to the First Accused on 17 April 2013: “Got u another USD20m line”, referring to the UBS account of Carlos Place, which was opened in March 2013, but which only received credit services on 17 April 2013.

 I do not propose to set them out and it suffices to say that they did support the Prosecution’s case.624 This brings me to the flip side of this picture – ie, second point stated at [619(b)] above.

 In none of these messages did any of the authorised signatories give Ms Cheng trading instructions. The Authorised Persons’ Analysis showed the same results. Save for the two accounts of Neptune Capital, there were zero proximate communications which preceded BAL orders entered in the accounts. Where Neptune Capital’s UBS account was concerned, there were 12 hits across all three counters for the whole Relevant Period. This only represented 4.7% of the total potential hits. The case was similar in relation to Neptune Capital’s Credit Suisse account. The Authorised Persons’ Analysis showed 2 hits and this represented just 0.2% of the total potential hits.

 626 The former resonated with the evidence which either directly showed or indirectly suggested that the accused persons had facilitated the transfers of shares to various financed accounts to be used as collateral (see, eg, [552]–[555], [575], [589] and [594] above). As to the latter, the fact that the accused persons had requested the accountholders to provide them with “comprehensive lists” of shareholdings added valuable context to the Shareholding Schedule and how it should be understood (see [744]–[750] below). Moreover, even putting aside the precise picture these messages painted, the fact that the accused persons had been asking for such information at all, was revealing.627  This brings me, finally, to the third point stated at [619(c)] above – the Defence’s submissions and evidence vis-à-vis the Relevant Accounts under this head. There was not much to deal with. In respect of the nine Alethia Asset Accounts, the First Accused simply submitted the following:

For accounts under [Alethia Asset (“AAMPL”)], the evidence was that the trading instructions were conveyed to the trading desk either by herself or by [Ivy] Tan Ai Bee. Both were authorised persons for the respective accounts. As such, there could not have been any deception on the part of the Accused Persons.Further, for these accounts, Cheng Jo-Ee gave evidence that she dealt with the accountholders regarding their portfolios, and that the Accused Persons only relayed instructions. She agreed the accountholders were HNIs and not people who would be the 1st Accused’s pawns.[footnotes omitted]628 The Second Accused made similar points:

For the AAMPL [External Asset Manager] Accounts, the trading instructions were given by [Ivy] Tan Ai Bee or Cheng Jo-Ee, both of whom were authorised persons for the relevant accounts. As stated above, there cannot have been a deception if the instructions were given by authorised persons.In addition, any instructions the accused gave were instructions relayed from the account holders. The evidence shows that Cheng Jo-Ee directly communicated with the account holders about their portfolios. She also agreed that the account holders were high net worth individuals who were not likely to be controlled by the 1st Accused.[footnotes omitted]629 I was mindful that these submissions were meant to address the Deception Charges to which these accounts related. However, the accused persons did not advance any separate submissions in relation to these accounts. In my view, the Defence did not provide any explanation of these objective records, or how they should be construed. As such, none of the inculpatory pieces of objective evidence had been dealt with by the Defence. Those objective pieces of evidence were accordingly left to speak for themselves, albeit with some characterisation by the Prosecution.630 Where the nine Alethia Asset Accounts were specifically concerned, the objective evidence was paramount, simply because there was a lot of it. The selection of messages at [620] above represented but a few of the many instruction-type messages the accused persons had sent Ms Cheng which resulted in BAL orders being placed in one of the nine Alethia Asset Accounts. The fact and volume of such messages, coupled with the other incriminating pieces of evidence set out at [622]–[626] above led inexorably to the conclusion that all nine Alethia Asset Accounts had been controlled. More specifically, as advanced by the Prosecution, the accounts of Neptune Capital and Whitefield had been controlled by both accused persons; but the accounts of Cale Management and Carlos Place had only been controlled by the First Accused. Moreover, for the reasons I gave at [508]–[517] above vis-à-vis the Group 1 accounts, it could be inferred from the fact of their unauthorised control of such a large number of accounts, that such control was with a view to effecting some common objective. Group 4: Foreign Accounts; no Deception Charges brought631 As stated at [200] above, Group 4 comprised Foreign Accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges. There were six Relevant Accounts within this group, though, as I will explain, the categorisation of one account within Group 4 was an anomaly. (1) Mr Hong’s account with Credit Suisse632 For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Hong had held two accounts with Credit Suisse. One account bore the account number 70919 and the other 806856.

 I have dealt with the former at [569]–[598] above as an account within Group 3. I have placed the latter within Group 4 because the Prosecution, for reasons which were not wholly clear, had decided not to bring a Deception Charge in respect thereof. This was not particularly coherent.633 In general, the line between the Relevant Accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges, and those which did not, was the authority of the Second Accused to instruct orders and trades. This was precisely why the accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges were (a) her personal accounts, (b) the corporate accounts for which she was an authorised signatory, and (c) the accounts in respect of which she had been granted an LPOA. As will be seen from [944] below, the conduct alleged against the accused persons by the Deception Charges was that they had concealed their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in the Relevant Accounts. In so doing, they engaged in a practice that was likely to operate as a deception on the FIs. Thus, where the Second Accused was on record as a person authorised to instruct orders and trades in the Relevant Account, it could not be said that the FIs had been deceived as to her involvement. After all, her involvement was on record.634 This issue arose when I considered the Defence’s submissions that there was no case to answer in respect of Ms Lim SH’s account with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua. In respect of Ms Lim SH’s account, the Prosecution took the position that only the Second Accused had instructed Ms Chua. When I pressed the Prosecution on how UOB Kay Hian could then be said to have been deceived as to her involvement, given that the Second Accused was formally authorised to give instructions in relation to the account, they argued that the First Accused’s involvement was still being concealed. This, however, was contrary to the Prosecution’s own case that it was the Second Accused who had instructed Ms Chua. The Deception Charge in respect of Ms Lim SH’s account, as the Prosecution had framed, was therefore not made out. Accordingly, as mentioned at [4(b)] and [518(b)] above, I acquitted the accused persons of this charge. 635 This brings me back to Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account that bore the account number 806856. Although I have placed it within Group 4, it strictly was not an account which could be subject to the same type of analysis applied to the accounts falling within Group 2 (in particular, see [519]–[520] above) as well as the other accounts within Group 4 (see [637]–[647] below). Neither accused person had prima facie control over this account by virtue of formal authorisation, and, thus, de facto control was still a fact which the Prosecution needed to prove in the same manner they had with the accounts within Groups 1 and 3. In categorising Mr Hong’s account in this manner, I was mindful that this was a slightly technical reason to state my findings in respect of this account in a separate part of these grounds. I recognise that I could have placed it within Group 3. However, the very purpose of the groupings set out at [200] was to impose a semblance of order on the mass of Relevant Accounts with which this case was concerned. Departure therefrom was prone to create untidiness. It was also desirable for me to explain this oddity in the Prosecution’s case.636 At any rate, I found that the accused persons had in fact been in control of this Credit Suisse account. My reasons for this conclusion mirrored those set out at [569]–[588] above in respect of Mr Hong’s other Credit Suisse account bearing the number 70919.(2) Five accounts belonging to the Second Accused637 This subgroup comprised five Relevant Accounts held in the name of the Second Accused, each held with a foreign FI: (a) IB; (b) Goldman Sachs; (c) JPMorgan; (d) UBS; (e) Julius Baer; and (f) Credit Suisse.

The inquiry in relation to these accounts was not whether they had been controlled by the accused persons; rather, it was whether there were indicia which suggested that the Second Accused had used or allowed her accounts to be used in connection with the same common objective observed vis-à-vis the Group 1, 2 and 3 accounts (see, eg, [519]–[520] above).640 As alluded at [563]–[566] above, I did not think much of Mr Phuah’s credibility as a witness. That said, his credibility as a witness did not affect my analysis of these two accounts. This was because the Prosecution did not specifically question Mr Phuah about the First Accused’s involvement with the use of these accounts. While the Prosecution did question Mr Phuah about proximate communications between himself and the Second Accused in relation to trades entered in her Julius Baer account (and even then, only briefly),

 they did not do so in relation to her UBS account. But, even if they had questioned Mr Phuah more thoroughly about the Second Accused’s proximate communications with Mr Phuah, that did not assist their case since the Second Accused was authorised to give trading instructions for her own account and there was nothing odd about her having done so. It would only have been odd if the First Accused had also done so, but as stated, the Prosecution omitted to question either Mr Phuah or the First Accused on these points. Furthermore, I should also note that, from 29 August 2012 to 7 January 2013, the authorised intermediary appointed in respect of the Second Accused’s account with UBS had been Stamford Management. Infiniti Asset took over from 17 January 2013.

 641 The Prosecution’s approach to leading the evidence relating to the actual usage of these two accounts left something to be desired. And, as a result of their oversight, I could not say whether the Second Accused’s UBS and Julius Baer accounts had been directly used by the First Accused since it was unclear if the First Accused had even communicated with Mr Phuah specifically in relation to both accounts (where the UBS account was concerned, after 17 January 2013); or Mr William Chan, in relation to the UBS account specifically between 29 August 2012 to 7 January 2013. This, in turn, meant that I could not rely on the GovTech Evidence on these accounts. This was because, as stated at [115]–[120] above, I only accorded such evidence corroborative weight. In order to corroborate, there must have been some primary evidence from which I could at least infer that the First Accused had exercised control over these two accounts (in contrast, see some of the accounts dealt with in Group 2: at [521]–[534] above). However, as there was no primary evidence to that end, I did not think it was appropriate to rely on the GovTech Evidence here.642 That said, this did not necessarily mean that the Second Accused’s UBS and Julius Baer accounts fell outside the scope of the alleged Scheme. As stated at [520] above, there were other indicia through which such a connection could be inferred where the Group 2 and 4 accounts were concerned, and the First Accused’s involvement in the usage of the accounts was but one indicium (albeit a fairly strong one). In the round, notwithstanding the Prosecution’s failure to establish the First Accused’s involvement in the use of these two accounts, I found that there was just enough evidence to support the inference that these accounts had been used in connection with some illicit purpose relating to BAL shares, that purpose being in common with the purpose for which the accounts in Groups 1, 2 and 3 had been used by the accused persons. (a) I start with the UBS account. I considered: (i) the nature of the relationship between the accused persons with Mr Phuah (in this regard, the First Accused’s own description of Mr Phuah was, as reproduced at [559] above, was telling); (ii) the fact that this account was being monitored in the Shareholding Schedule;

643 I was mindful that these factual premises did not constitute the strongest foundations from which it could be inferred that the accounts had been pulled into some scheme being run by the accused persons. However, while these were certainly not the strongest foundations (stronger foundations would have been built if the Prosecution had established the First Accused’s clear involvement in the usage of the two accounts), seen in their proper context, they were not weak. For one, these factual premises were the same as those I had relied on in relation to 13 of the 19 accounts in Group 2 (see [537]–[539] above). But, more saliently, as I stated at [538] above, the inordinately high concentration of BAL trades was rather unusual and called, in light of all the evidence against the Second Accused, for her explanation. There was no opposing account from the Second Accused to undermine the weight of these strands of evidence. 644 I turn next to the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs account. This account also featured in the Shareholding Schedule

 Coupled with (a) the evidence discussed at [595] above which, when read with [575] and [594], suggested that the First Accused was likely involved in arranging the initial collateral for her account; as well as (b) the sequence of communications and orders described at [597]–[598], there was certainly sufficient basis to conclude that this account had been pulled into some scheme being run by the accused persons.645 This leaves me with the third category of accounts stated at [638] above ie, the Second Accused’s JPMorgan and Credit Suisse accounts. I found that both these accounts had also been used by the Second Accused in connection with the same scheme into which the controlled Relevant Accounts within Groups 1, 2 and 3 had been pulled. I explain my reasons for these views for each account in turn. 646 The Second Accused’s JPMorgan account had been monitored in the Shareholding Schedule.

 This email was dated 20 November 2011 and herein, the Second Accused listed several accounts and TRs alongside a sum of money. For example, under the heading “GHC” (ie, Mr Goh HC), there were the following items: (a) “Philips: $12,686 POEM S 326923”; (b) “CIMB: $3,200”; and (c) “Jack: $4,442.37 (due on 21/11)”. In respect of her own accounts (listed under the heading “S” for “Su-Ling”), the Second Accused included, amongst other things, “JP morgan – $4,700 margin interest”. It was plain that, by this email, the Second Accused had been reporting the gains made and losses suffered in various accounts to the First Accused. Indeed, in a follow-up email to the First Accused,

 the Second Accused stated, “Sorry. for my account please add: $3,200 (my check to lim tan bounce and i had to get emergency funding from sister) … $5,900 to lincoln – from sister for losses” [emphasis added]. I was mindful that the email had been sent before the Relevant Period. However, when viewed alongside the Shareholding Schedule and the fact that the account only traded in BAL shares, the Second Accused’s use of this JPMorgan account called for an explanation. Without her explanation, I drew the same adverse inference against her that no legitimate explanation existed.647 Lastly, I turn to the Second Accused’s Credit Suisse account. The analysis of this account differed slightly. It did not appear in the accused persons’ Shareholding Schedule, but its concentration in BAL trades was still very high at 98.10%, and this represented S$8,718,391.90 in worth of BAL shares that had been traded in this account across the whole Relevant Period.

 Beyond this, however, the circumstances surrounding the closure of this account were also revealing. The account had been closed alongside Mr Hong and Mr Billy Ooi’s Credit Suisse accounts (see [591] and [593] above). As stated, in February 2013, Credit Suisse was no longer willing to accept BAL shares as collateral for the provision of financing. Thus, Mr William Chan met with Mr Hong and the accused persons to discuss “what to do about [Credit Suisse] terminating their financing”. This discussion concluded with the request that Mr William Chan “find another bank that would extend financing on similar terms that [Credit Suisse] provided, to purchase LionGold shares using Asiasons shares as collateral”. This bank ended up being Goldman Sachs, with which Mr Hong and the Second Accused then opened accounts. While there was, of course, nothing inherently wrong with moving from a bank which did not wish to provide a particular service to another which did, the fact that the Second Accused’s Credit Suisse account had been dealt with by the accused persons in connection with the accounts of other Relevant Accountholders I found to have been controlled by the accused persons pursuant to a broader scheme was, in my judgment, enough to call for her explanation. And, again, without her explanation, I drew the same adverse inference as I expressed at [646] above.Accounts under the Manhattan House Group648 I turn to the last group of Relevant Accounts mentioned at [200] above. The Defence’s case in respect of this group was briefly set out at [130(a)] above and I address that general case as well as its many details, in the following sequence:(a) First, I will set out, chronologically, the Prosecution’s case in respect of how the accused persons came to be associated with Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, as well as how their dealings started out and evolved over time. I will then set out the Defence’s narrative. In this connection, it bears recalling that the Defence took out impeachment applications against Mr Tai, Mr Gan as well as Mr Tjoa: see [131] above. Once both sides’ accounts have been described, I then explain why I did not accept the Defence’s general case in relation to the Manhattan House Group.(b) Second, against the background of my findings made in the subsection above, I will then set out my decision on the specific question of control vis-à-vis: (i) the 32 Relevant Accounts under Mr Tai’s management (through the two Algo Companies)

 – 11 of which had been held with IB and the other 21 with Saxo; (ii) the two accounts held with DMG & Partners under Mr Gan’s management; and (iii) the 27 accounts held with Phillip Securities under Mr Tjoa’s management.(1) The Manhattan House Group generally649 Mr Gwee was a long-time associate of the First Accused. They met in the early 1980s when the First Accused had employed Mr Gwee as the general manager of his very first business known as “Wings”.

 Similarly, Mr Gwee and the Second Accused had known each other for years. On Mr Gwee’s account, they first met in 1998 when he was an Executive Director of InnoPac. Their meeting, which was a business meeting, had been set up by the First Accused who was, at the time, the Managing Director of InnoPac.

650 Notwithstanding that the accused persons had known Mr Gwee for the longest time amongst the members of the Manhattan House Group, the manner in which he had featured in this case came in somewhat later. Thus, it is apposite to start substantively with Mr Tai, whose association with the accused persons started sometime in late 2010, when he was introduced to the Second Accused by one Mr Roger Tan, a friend of Mr Tai.651 At the time of the introduction, Mr Tai was a TR with AmFraser.

 These interactions did not initially lead to anything further where AmFraser had been concerned. This was because Mr Tai felt that AmFraser’s low risk appetite made it difficult to take on clients. As an example, Think Environmental shares were not, at that time, marginable at the FI, which prevented Mr Tai from taking on the Second Accused’s friends as clients.

Cash and margin accounts were set up for each of them. Both Mr Hong and Mr Sugiarto informed Mr Tai that he was to seek out the Second Accused for matters relating to their accounts. Mr Tai did so accordingly and, whilst doing so, he incidentally asked the Second Accused if she would also be managing the affairs of Mr Goh HC and Ms Huang’s accounts. The Second Accused confirmed that she would be and consequently made arrangements for LionGold shares to be placed into the four accountholders’ margin accounts as the initial collateral.

As with other TRs, Mr Tai was able to give specific evidence as regards how the Second Accused did so. For example: (a) that she had instructed contra trades for all eight accounts; (b) that the sequence in which orders had been placed in particular accountholders’ accounts was important to her (as this helped avoid accidental wash trades when those accountholders’ accounts with other FIs had orders on the other side of the book);

Nevertheless, during Mr Gan’s stint at AmFraser, the persons who had given trading instructions for all the accounts were the Second Accused initially and, subsequently, also the user of the 3611 number (ie, the First Accused: see [198(a)] above).

That said, the FI did gradually increase the trading limits of Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC’s accounts because of the contra profits made and retained in their accounts.

 Nevertheless, these increases were still not substantial. As with Mr Tai, the generally low trading limits accorded by AmFraser also led to Mr Gan resigning from his position in AmFraser (whereupon, as stated at [301] above, the accounts under his management were handed over to Mr Kam). With the help of Mr Gwee, who put Mr Gan in touch with Mr Nicholas Ng (the then-CEO of DMG & Partners), Mr Gan managed to secure a position as a TR in DMG & Partners, which he took up in the first quarter of 2011. 657 Prior to taking up that position, Mr Gan called Mr Gwee, the Second Accused and the First Accused (whom he still knew as “Peter” at the time) to keep them apprised of his situation. Mr Gwee assured Mr Gan that the accounts being used by the Second Accused and “Peter” would follow him to DMG & Partners, but this did not materialise. Instead, the Second Accused had arranged for Mr Lim KY to open an account with Mr Gan in May 2011 (this being one of two Relevant Accounts under Mr Gan’s management).

 However, I will return to this in due course as it is preferable to proceed chronologically from the first half of 2011 and describe the noteworthy events which took place from this time until the end of the Relevant Period in October 2013. Those events included the following.659 In the first half of 2011 (specifically, in March, May and June), seven new Relevant Accounts had been opened with Phillip Securities under Mr Tjoa.

 he had only met these accountholders shortly before they opened accounts with him. It bears highlighting that these events took place before Mr Tjoa had been introduced to the accused persons.660 Next, sometime in the middle of 2011, Mr Tjoa was introduced to the accused persons by Mr Tai on the basis that the accused persons were keen on opening trading accounts with him.

661 Concurrent with the foregoing, DMG & Partners also started to become uncomfortable with the high volume of Asiasons and LionGold trades being executed in the eight Relevant Accounts of Mr Goh HC, Ms Huang, Mr Hong and Mr Sugiarto. It thus gradually imposed greater and greater trading limits on Mr Tai who, in turn, was unable to conduct as many trades for the accused persons using those accounts. This affected the commission he earned from such trades and, ultimately, led to him leaving his position as a TR with the FI on 31 October 2011,

 whereupon the eight accounts were handed over to Mr Alex Chew as mentioned at [231] above.662 In the month leading up to Mr Tai leaving DMG & Partners, he started looking into whether he could open accounts with Saxo in order to continue carrying out trades for the accused persons.

 He explained to the accused persons how the accounts would function (see [732] below) and managed to persuade them to make arrangements for their associates to open accounts with Saxo. Thus, between 5 October and 23 December 2011, eight Relevant Accountholders each opened an account with Saxo.

 the Second Accused was the one who gave Mr Tai the completed account-opening forms and supporting documents to initiate their opening with Saxo.

 In this role, he received a monthly salary of S$2,000 but, on Mr Tai’s evidence, he had no real function within the company. The job and salary served, instead, to tide him over a period of unemployment. His actual role was to take trading instructions from the accused persons and place those instructed orders in ITE Asset’s account with Phillip Securities (opened slightly earlier: see [660] above). Mr Tai did so with ITE Asset’s online trading account, the login details for which he had obtained from ITE Electric’s CEO. Indeed, apart from using ITE Asset’s online trading account, Mr Tai also: (a) took the accused persons’ instructions for the Saxo accounts which had been opened by this time;

These arrangements largely mirrored those discussed above (eg, see [468] above in relation to Mr Wong XY). Once contra losses were reported, runners would be sent with cheques or cash to settle payment with the FI. Those runners were Mr Najib and Mr Jumaat. On Mr Tjoa’s evidence, this arrangement continued up until the Crash.

As for Mr Tjoa, 19 of the total 27 Relevant Accounts held with Phillip Securities under his management had either been opened with or transferred to him. 668 In the middle of 2012, Mr Tai had informed Mr Tjoa that the accused persons would begin giving the latter trading instructions for the Phillip Securities accounts under his management. On both Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa’s evidence, Mr Tai had previously been giving such instructions in respect of some of the Phillip Securities accounts: see [663] above. According to Mr Tjoa, when Mr Tai had informed him that the accused persons would instruct him directly, Mr Tai also explained that this new arrangement was necessary because he had “too many other accounts” to manage for the accused persons,

 a statement which was consistent with the numerous Saxo accounts being opened at the time. 669 Thus, from this point, Mr Tjoa started receiving trading instructions from the accused persons. On his evidence, they generally instructed trades in LionGold (and, to a lesser extent, in Asiasons). The manner in which they traded was also similar to that seen in respect of other accounts as follows: (a) the accused persons would call Mr Tjoa to give trading instructions; (b) such instructions were typically for contra trades caried out on a rolling basis and Mr Tjoa would either place the orders himself or direct his assistants to do so; (c) the accused persons did not distinguish between the individual Phillip Securities accounts and saw them as interchangeable; and (d) the accused persons would give Mr Tjoa fairly specific instructions, on occasion even directing him to split up certain sell orders.

 upon each of these accounts either being opened or transferred to their management, the accused persons were the ones who had arranged for the placement of collateral into the accounts (where margin accounts were concerned), had given trading instructions on the accounts, and had covered the contra losses incurred therein.672 Also around this time (ie, in the latter half of 2012), there were other significant events which also took place.

 after the accused persons had started utilising the IB accounts, IB varied the gearing ratio of the accounts which resulted in all but one of the IB accounts falling below their margin requirements. The accused persons then took steps to furnish additional collateral to prevent IB from force-selling the collateral which had been placed in the IB accounts. On Mr Tai’s evidence, the First Accused even impersonated Mr Neo in a conversation with an IB officer to discuss the manner in which collateral could be topped up in the accounts. Thereafter, Mr Tai also assisted the accused persons and Mr Goh HC with those top-up arrangements. 673 However, certain problems arose in the course of the accused persons’ efforts to top-up the collateral in the accounts. As a consequence, IB force-sold some of the shares held in the accounts much to the accused persons’ chagrin, who ceased using the accounts for some weeks and even contemplated closing all 11 accounts. The decrease in trading activity, in turn, led to IB contacting Mr Tai to “get [him] to persuade the accountholders to resume their trading activities”.

 How [the First Accused (“JS”)] and [the Second Accused (“QSL”)] conducted their market rollingAs mentioned earlier, I personally witnessed JS and QSL carrying out their market operations while working with them in LionGold’s meeting room. Since they had been rolling a large volume of LionGold and Asiasons shares on contra all this while, their priority each day was to keep track of how many shares were due, and to ensure there was trading limit available in other proxy accounts to take over these shares. The cycle would then repeat itself every T +5 days.At the start of each day, the trading representatives at various brokerages who were in charge of JS’s and QSL’s proxy accounts would report to QSL or JS on the number of shares that were due. This was the same as when I was the DMG trading representative in charge of JS and QSL’s proxy accounts there.As with their usual practice, QSL coordinated the daily market roll for LionGold, while JS did the same for Asiasons. I would say that usually, it was more challenging for QSL to complete her market roll for LionGold shares compared to JS’s market roll for Asiasons shares. This was because the total value (quantity x price) of LionGold shares being rolled over was generally higher than that of Asiasons shares, which meant that QSL had to utilise more trading limit in the proxy accounts.After JS and QSL had ascertained how many shares they had to roll at the start of each day, they would plan the order of trading using other proxy accounts with available trading limit, such that all the shares that were due could be “cleared” by the end of the day. JS and QSL had to plan the order of trading carefully because in practice, they never had enough trading limit to absorb all the shares that were due at once. This meant that they had to stagger the rolling so that the trading limits of those accounts which had been “refreshed” could be used to take over the next group of accounts, and so on. In addition, they had to ensure that the trading was done in various accounts because concentrating all the trades in a few accounts would look suspicious to the authorities.…Most of the time, JS and QSL were able to conduct their market rolling smoothly because as QSL said, most of the market volumes for LionGold and Asiasons shares respectively were actually generated by their group. There were very few third-parties trading in these two counters. However, there were some occasions where third parties became involved in the daily rolling. My informal term for these third parties was “aliens”.JS and QSL generally had no problems with “aliens” entering the market for LionGold and Asiasons shares if they were on the buy side of the trade. In fact, this could be beneficial for them because the “alien” would be taking over one block of shares that they would otherwise have to keep rolling and incurring commissions and possible contra losses. JS and QSL were happy to have some genuine demand for LionGold and Asiasons shares, as long as the “aliens” did not acquire a too sizeable shareholding in these companies, and as long as the “aliens” held the shares for the long term and did not release them back into the market soon after.However, whenever there were “aliens” entering the market with a large sell order, QSL would refer to them as “si gui” or “wa kao lang”. This was Hokkien for “damned ghost” and “outsider” respectively. There were three main problems which “aliens” on the sell side of the queue could cause for JS and QSL. First, they could disrupt the order of trading because if the buy orders which they had instructed ended up hitting the “alien’s” sell order instead of the sell orders of the accounts they wanted to refresh, they would have to quickly find other available accounts to buy from and refresh their selling accounts. Second, if JS and QSL had to take over a large block of shares from a third party, this would add to the total quantity of shares they had to keep rolling over. Not only would this make their job of rolling the shares more difficult, but they would also be exposed to potentially more commissions and contra losses. Third, JS and QSL might have to sell at a price that was one bid lower than the intended selling price, and hit the best bid, to avoid hitting the “alien’s” selling order in the queue with their buy orders. This would have resulted in a greater contra loss for the same volume of shares traded.…JS and QSL carried on the above trading activities every trading day when I was in the LionGold office. Occasionally, they would cover for each other when the other person was not available to coordinate the trading activities.The trading representatives in contact with JS and QSL during this time included Henry Tjoa, Gabriel Gan, Leroy Lau, Lincoln Lee, Wong Xue Yu, See Khng Lim, Alex Chew, Ong Kah Chye. There was also an “Andy” from Lim & Tan but I do not know his surname or who he was. Apart from the trading representatives, JS and QSL also received calls from others who were helping them with their trading activities, such as William Chan and Adeline Cheng (who were external fund managers) and Steve Phuah (who was working for QSL’s sister’s company, ISR Capital Ltd, which was a fund management company).675 Again, it was also around October 2012 that Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa each met Mr Gwee. On Mr Tai’s account, he had met Mr Gwee for the first time when he started working out of LionGold’s meeting room, when he had been assisting the accused persons’ market operations. Mr Tai did not, however, start working closely with Mr Gwee immediately.

676 The next noteworthy event took place in February 2013, when Mr Tai and the Second Accused quarrelled. This argument would eventually contribute to Mr Tai’s move to Manhattan House and, therefore, is meaningful to set out in full. Indeed, the contents of this quarrel, as described by Mr Tai, were highly probative of the accused persons’ Scheme:

I had a major argument with QSL in February 2013 regarding the trading activities in the Saxo and IB accounts. Before I describe what happened, I need to explain the background to this argument, which involves a person named Leroy Lau. Leroy Lau was a trader in DMG. He was working in DMG when I was a trading representative there, and had been around for many years. Leroy is quite well known in the stockbroking industry because he had a very large trading line. I do not know how Leroy met JS and QSL. By 2012, JS and QSL had mentioned to me that Leroy was one of the trading representatives assisting them with their market activities for LionGold. Leroy also became involved in trading in Asiasons and Blumont shares later.Leroy was very valuable to JS and QSL because he could use his large trading line to take over shares that they needed to roll, when they had no spare trading limit available. In return, JS guaranteed Leroy a profit on any trades he executed. Unlike other trading representatives, Leroy traded on his own account instead of for clients. This meant that Leroy made money by executing profitable trades, instead of earning commission from the brokerage for trading. JS told me that his arrangement with Leroy was that if Leroy purchased any shares of LionGold for JS, JS would try to arrange for other proxy accounts under his and QSL’s control to buy these shares back from Leroy at a higher price. I am not sure whether JS and Leroy had the same arrangement for Asiasons and Blumont shares.I was not very happy with having to spend my time and effort using the Saxo and IB accounts to buy high and sell low when trading with Leroy, which ended up benefitting Leroy. This was because the money that was going into Leroy’s pocket effectively came from the margin financing provided by Saxo and IB. In the event of any margin calls, it was I and not Leroy who would have the problem of getting JS to top up these accounts. Moreover, while I earned commissions on the trades with Leroy, I felt that Leroy was taking advantage of JS and QSL because of the manner in which he traded.Sometime in February 2013, I casually asked QSL while we were in the LionGold meeting room whether it was possible for me to not always end up having to use the Saxo and 18 accounts to buy high and sell low. JS was also present at the time. In response, QSL flared up and scolded me for a long time. I cannot remember everything that she said, but I do remember QSL saying “Ler kan chiong zuo si mi? Long zong account si John eh. Long zong account mm si Malaysian jiu si BVI. Za ma si bo fer eh tai ji.” This was Hokkien for “What are you so worried about? All the accounts belong to John. All the accounts are either Malaysian or BVI. If anything explodes, it is not your problem.”I also remember QSL saying, “We must take everything as a whole. All the funds are still circulating within the group.” I understood QSL to mean that since all the proxy accounts were controlled by her and JS, it did not matter that trading profits or losses were unevenly distributed across some accounts.QSL ended up throwing a piece of paper with some writing on it at me and said that if I was so smart, I could just do all the rolling for her. I did not see what was written on the paper. I felt angry and humiliated at being shouted at by QSL in this manner, especially since I was looking out for JS’ and QSL’s interests when I raised the issue with QSL. I was also disappointed that JS just sat there did nothing while QSL was shouting at me in that manner. I walked out of the office. Eventually, JS called and told me not to take things too hard and invited me back to the office. QSL then apologised to me for her outburst. However, QSL’s attitude towards me changed considerably after this incident. She became colder and did not talk to me as often as she used to.[emphasis added]677 Following this incident, Mr Tai continued to work with the accused persons, in LionGold’s office. However, sometime in March 2013, the accused persons made arrangements for their “base of operations” to be moved to a different office located just one floor below LionGold’s office – this was known as the “Dubai Room”. Mr Tai was not aware exactly why the accused persons had arranged this move but suggested that it was likely due to a lack of privacy in LionGold’s office.

 On Mr Tai’s evidence, he met the First Accused the day after speaking to Mr Gwee. The First Accused informed him that Second Accused wished to take a break, and that they wanted him to attempt managing the “market rolling activities” on his own. Mr Tai agreed and took up the role. Therefore, from mid-March until the first week of April 2013,

 he coordinated the daily market roll of LionGold shares, using the Saxo and IB accounts to trade with the other Relevant Accounts. 679 Mr Tjoa gave corroborative evidence that he had been told that Mr Tai would be taking over the coordination of “market rolling activities” for LionGold shares because the Second Accused was busy with other matters.

 Indeed, because of the rivalry between Mr Tai and Mr Leroy Lau (see [676] above), there were occasions on which Mr Tai would deliberately refuse to buy LionGold shares back from Mr Leroy Lau as he was supposed to. Both Mr Tai and Mr Leroy Lau testified on this,

 and the consequence was that the First Accused had to intervene to instruct Mr Tai to buy back the shares as he was supposed to. These circumstances, if accepted as true, plainly showed that – notwithstanding the delegation of some “market rolling activities” to Mr Tai – the First Accused was ultimately in-charge of their operations as a whole.680 The next significant event took place in April 2013. It was during this month that the accused persons had taken away Mr Tai’s responsibility for rolling LionGold shares, and handed it over to Mr Leroy Lau.

 Mr Tai’s evidence was corroborated by text messages exchanged between the Second Accused and Ms Cheng on 16 April 2013. Ms Cheng had asked the Second Accused if they could sell some LionGold shares, and, in response, the Second Accused answered: “We will be selling but I am letting the market maker call the shots. They are managing.. Your request has been put through.. Will do soon” [emphasis added].

 The Defence themselves persistently referred to Mr Leroy Lau as a “market maker”; thus, there was little doubt that the Second Accused had been talking about him. Several hours after this message and been sent, various calls and messages were then exchanged between the Second Accused and Mr Leroy Lau which, in turn, resulted in trades being entered by Ms Cheng.

Move to Manhattan House in June 2013Sometime in June 2013, I moved out of the Dubai room and continued my trading activities for JS and QSL in LionGold and Asiasons shares at an office at Manhattan House located at Chin Swee Road. Let me explain the background to this.By May 2013, I was actually thinking of stopping my work for JS and QSL. The main reason for this was because my relationship with QSL had not been good after my argument with her in February 2013, even though we acted as if things were okay on the surface. I also noticed that QSL’s general attitude towards the other trading representatives in the group had gotten worse after she and JS started opening new proxy accounts with the private banks. I believe that QSL felt she did not need to depend so much on the trading representatives with the local brokerages anymore, and she did not need to be nice to them.I was also unhappy about JS’ decision to take away my responsibility for the market roll of LionGold shares and to put Leroy in charge instead. I felt that I was no longer valued by JS and QSL and was thus seriously thinking of leaving. It was Henry Tjoa who convinced me to stay on. Henry was one of the trading representatives I was closer to and I considered him a friend. Henry wanted me to continue with the group because he was worried that if I left, he might no longer get as much business from JS and QSL.Henry suggested that instead of working in the Dubai room with QSL, we could rent a separate office space of our own and continue assisting in JS’ and QSL’s trading activities from there. I thought about this idea and agreed. It was Henry who found an office space at Manhattan House for our use. Manhattan House was chosen because of its proximity to the Sultan Link Building where the LionGold office and Dubai room were located. Even after moving to Manhattan House, Henry and I would still go to the Dubai Room almost every day to visit JS and QSL.Sometime after moving into Manhattan House, in July 2013, JS gave me a call and told me that he wanted me to take over the market roll for Asiasons shares because he would be busy with corporate developments. I agreed. The arrangement was the same as when I coordinated the market roll for LionGold shares earlier in April 2013. This arrangement was only for Asiasons shares. I continued to take specific instructions from QSL for trades in LionGold shares, and from JS and Dick Gwee for trades in Blumont. As with the time I coordinated the market roll for LionGold, I was not given any specific price targets to hit for Asiasons.Around this time, Dick Gwee visited Henry and I at Manhattan House one day to tell us that Gabriel Gan would be part of the “inner circle” of traders who JS entrusted with more responsibilities. Prior to this, I was acquainted with Gabriel Gan and was aware he was a trading representative for two of JS’ and QSL’s proxy accounts at DMG in the names of Nelson Fernandez and Lim Kuan Yew. However, it was from this point onwards that Gabriel started playing a bigger role in JS’ and QSL’s trading activities. Dick Gwee told me that Gabriel would be coming to Manhattan House to “understudy” me for a few days and to observe the way I coordinated the daily rolling activities for Asiasons shares. Dick also asked me to give some business to Gabriel Gan by involving him in my trading activities when I had blocks of shares to roll over. Since I respected Dick as my mentor, I agreed. Subsequently, Gabriel came to Manhattan House a couple of times to observe the way I conducted the daily market roll for Asiasons shares.A few days after Dick Gwee’s visit, Henry Tjoa and I went back to the Dubai room to attend a meeting which JS had called. There were six of us present at this meeting: JS, QSL, Dick Gwee, myself, Henry Tjoa and Gabriel Gan. This was the group that Dick Gwee referred to as the “inner circle”. JS told us that he had called for the meeting because he wanted to talk about the direction he wanted the share price of the three companies (i.e. Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold) to move in for the next few months. I cannot remember everything that JS said, but he did mention that July would be quiet for Blumont and Asiasons, and that things will get more exciting in August and September. I understood JS to be suggesting that we might have to help him move up the share price for Blumont and Asiasons in August and September 2013. I cannot remember what JS said about LionGold.From July 2013 onwards, I used the Saxo and 18 accounts to trade with JS’ and QSL’s proxy accounts at Phillip Securities under Henry Tjoa, as well as JS’ and QSL’s proxy accounts at DMG under Gabriel as part of the market roll for Asiasons shares. Since I was no longer working from the Dubai room, I had to update JS at the end of each day regarding my rolling activities. I called JS using my “bangla phone” [ie, unregistered phones]

 and reported to him the number of shares I managed to roll for the day, and the number of shares I bought or sold from aliens in the market. I also continued to submit the regular spreadsheets to QSL (which I mentioned earlier) summarising the amount of Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold shares held in the Saxo and 18 accounts every month.My responsibility for coordinating the daily market roll for Asiasons shares lasted only a month. In August 2013, JS told me that Gabriel Gan would be taking over the market roll for Asiasons. From August 2013, I took instructions from Gabriel Gan on the trades to execute in the Saxo and 18 accounts for Asiasons shares.682 Mr Tjoa corroborated Mr Tai’s account in respect of the move to Manhattan House,

 Such delegation was also placed in context by Mr Tai and Mr Gan. According to them, the accused persons had delegated “market rolling activities” to them because the First Accused had become busier with corporate deal-making.

 This made sense in the context of the evidence pertaining to the accused persons’ endgame for the Scheme, to which I will turn at [853]–[869] below.683 Against the backdrop of all of this context, it is appropriate to return to the role of Mr Gwee. As stated at the outset of this section (see [649] above), the accused persons and Mr Gwee were long-time associates. On the Prosecution’s case, Mr Gwee had been brought into the Scheme by the First Accused as an “experienced hand” to oversee the “market-rolling activities” for Asiasons and, subsequently, Blumont.

 To this end, they suggested that Mr Gwee had been delegated the function of giving instructions in respect of trades placed in several Relevant Accounts, these being the 27 Phillip Securities accounts under Mr Tjoa, the two accounts with DMG & Partners under Mr Gan, and 32 accounts with IB and Saxo under Mr Tai. This was supported by the testimonies of Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, who gave evidence that they saw Mr Gwee as the First Accused’s deputy who would exercise oversight over the Scheme in his absence.

 In fact, even Mr Leroy Lau, who did not work out of the Manhattan House office and, thus, did not see Mr Gwee as frequently as Mr Tai, Mr Gan or Mr Tjoa, also stated that he understood Mr Gwee to be helping the First Accused with “trading strategy”.

684 The Defence’s response to the evidence given by Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa and Mr Leroy Lau – evidence which was plainly inculpatory of them – was layered. Their basic response was that they simply had not directed and, therefore, were not responsible for acts done under the hand or instructions of Mr Gwee, who they suggested was one of the true rogues manipulating the market in concert with Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa.685 However, at a more fundamental level, the Defence took issue with the manner in which Mr Gwee’s role had been put forth by the Prosecution prior to and even during the trial. In essence, it was their position that they could not adequately formulate a defence in respect of Mr Gwee because: (a) the Prosecution’s position on his role was not made clear; (b) the Prosecution did not take a clear position in respect of Mr Gwee to “suppress avenues of inquiry favourable to the Defence”; and (c) as a result of these steps, the Defence had little to work with, so as to demonstrate that Mr Gwee was the person actually coordinating the market manipulation scheme with Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, beyond Mr Gwee’s admission on the stand that he had made a substantial amount of money from trading in BAL shares.

686 I did not accept these contentions. The most salient observation to be made in this regard relates to the evidence of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa and Mr Leroy Lau. Each of these individuals gave their own accounts as to the role of Mr Gwee vis-à-vis the accused persons’ Scheme, and their evidence-in-chief was given substantially by conditioned statements which had been disclosed to the Defence. To put the point very broadly, without a great deal of precision, those individuals each gave evidence that the accused persons had been behind the Scheme, not Mr Gwee, and to the extent that Mr Gwee had been involved, he was said to have given instructions or acted on behalf of the First Accused. As such, putting aside everything known or unknown about Mr Gwee’s involvement, or anything the Prosecution may or may not have done procedurally, the fundamental issue the Defence needed and had always needed to tackle, from the very outset, was what to make of these witnesses’ evidence. In respect of Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, impeachment applications were made, but none was made against Mr Leroy Lau. As I explained at [308]–[322] above in respect of Mr Leroy Lau and will explain from [688]–[726] below in respect of Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa, I accepted the key aspects of their evidence, and nothing about the First Accused’s evidence suggested this conclusion was incorrect.687 Obviously, Mr Gwee sought not to incriminate himself by “downplaying his involvement” – as the Prosecution put to him at trial.

 However, I did not accord his evidence much weight in and of itself. It was only alongside the tested and objectively supported evidence of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa and Mr Leroy Lau that I was convinced that Mr Gwee had not been the individual behind the alleged Scheme, as contended by the Defence. In order to reach the opposite conclusion, the Defence would have needed to convince me that the four individuals (apart from Mr Gwee) were not witnesses of truth. This was, in fact, the essence of the First Accused’s case, who contended that, Mr Tai, Mr Tjoa and Mr Gan admitted under cross-examination that they had “concealed [Mr Gwee’s] involvement as they saw him as their head and did not want to implicate him. On the other hand, they had put all the blame and pointed all their fingers at the accused persons: it was all John Soh, John Soh and John Soh!”

 Mr Tai had, in a statement he had given the CAD on 24 June 2015, stated that he had unintentionally placed BAL trades in Algo Capital Group’s own account with IB which were not for his own benefit (this was not a Relevant Account). He called these “butter-finger trades”.

He explained that he had lied to the CAD to avoid incriminating himself. As I understood it, his lie had the potential to go towards that objective because, though Mr Tai also admitted that some of the trades in Algo Capital Group’s IB account had been executed on his own part and for his own benefit, other trades had also been instructed by the First Accused.

 Indeed, Mr Tai went beyond merely concealing his and the accused persons’ involvement with the Scheme. On his account, the First Accused had requested he give false evidence in a lawsuit, and to take the rap for the accused persons in the criminal investigations. It was in this context that Mr Tai generally explained why he had lied in his earlier investigation statements, and it was only at the end of April 2015 that he decided to come clean. That was, after events unfolded which led Mr Tai to lose trust in the First Accused.

 692 As I will explain when I turn to set out my decision in respect of the Witness Tampering Charges, there was evidence which supported Mr Tai’s account (see [1250]–[1268] below). I gave his explanation careful consideration and, ultimately, I accepted his account that the First Accused had tampered with his evidence during the investigation, and that he had, accordingly, lied in his statements to the CAD. In reaching this conclusion, I accepted Mr Tai’s explanations for the differences between his statements to the CAD and his testimony in court, and considered his credit not to have been impeached on the basis of the material inconsistencies between the two. 693 That said, I was very conscious of the fact that Mr Tai had, on his own evidence, played a substantial role in the alleged Scheme run by the accused persons. I was also conscious of the various arguments raised by the accused persons against the credibility of Mr Tai’s evidence more generally; that was, apart from the specific grounds of their impeachment applications (for example, see [132] above). Accordingly, I treated his evidence with caution, and I was mindful to test his account against those of the other witnesses, as well as the objective evidence. Ultimately, however, my view was that the objective evidence and testimonies of other witnesses, particularly the TRs whose evidence I discussed in connection with Group 1 above, lent overwhelming support not only for Mr Tai’s narrative specifically, but the overall thrust of the Prosecution’s case, and Mr Tai’s place in that case. Thus, on these premises, I accepted Mr Tai’s evidence and found that the accused persons had controlled the 32 Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and IB under Mr Tai’s management.694 I should note that in arriving at this view, I paid particular attention to the First Accused’s submission that Mr Tai had, during the Relevant Period, used the IB and Saxo accounts to carry out: (a) “unauthorised trades”; (b) “ping-pong trades”; and (c) “scam trades” in BAL shares. The fact of such trades, it was argued, showed that Mr Tai had been engaged in “illicit market manipulative activities” and, thus, that the IB and Saxo accounts under Mr Tai’s management had not been controlled by the accused persons.

First, Ken Tai had carried out unauthorised trades between the [Relevant] Accounts at Saxo and IB. In fact, it was Ken Tai who coined the term “unauthorised trades” to describe trading done between the [Relevant] Accounts at Saxo and IB!It is certainly telling that Ken Tai had described these trades as “unauthorised” – it shows that Ken Tai was aware that these trades were illegal and was not “authorised” or instructed, by the account holders or the Accused Persons on their behalf.A review of the data showed that Ken Tai’s unauthorised trades were massive:(a) In LionGold, the trade volume of “unauthorised trades” from 1 August 2012 amounted to 486, 088,000. In particular, the trade volume of such “unauthorised trades” in LionGold reached an all-time high of 158m in between 15 March 2013 to 5 April 2013.(b) In Asiasons, the trade volume of “unauthorised trades” from 1 August 2012 amounted to 274,856,000. In particular, the trade volume of such “unauthorised trades” in Asiasons reached 23.6m in July 2013.As Ken Tai himself had admitted, it was not necessary to roll-over or to engage in such wash trading between the [Relevant] Accounts given that the trades were contracts for difference (CFD). This was done to the detriment of the account holders who had to pay transaction costs every 5 days, even though there was absolutely no benefit to them.Ken Tai admitted that he was the biggest beneficiary earning commissions from the market rolling done in Saxo even though there was absolutely no reason to do so. Ken Tai was motivated by his own greed.For Saxo accounts, Ken Tai stated that he earned around 0.05 percent commission for each transaction. This meant that for every $100m worth of trade, he would get $50,000 in commission. For IB accounts, he earned about 0.02 percent in commission for each transaction. In fact, Ken Tai agreed he had made more than $1 million in commissions for the trades done in IB accounts, and around $2 million in commissions for the trades done in Saxo accounts. This was done over the period of 15 months. Moreover, Ken Tai agreed that he would get commissions from the transactions and a cut of the interest; this meant that he also benefitted from the use of the margin lines by the accountholders.It is evident that these “unauthorised” trades were done on Ken Tai’s own initiative, for the sole purpose of generating commissions, at the expense of the accountholders.Additionally, it is highlighted that the months with the highest volume of “unauthorised trades” are the months during which Ken Tai claims that the 1st Accused allegedly instructed him to engage in market operations.696 I did not accept these arguments. First of all, Mr Tai did not coin the term “unauthorised trade”. The term was first used by Mr Sreenivasan in a question posed during cross-examination, and Mr Tai appeared simply to have repeated the term used.

 Second, and in any event, I did not think that the mere fact that Mr Tai used the word “unauthorised” supported the substantive point which the First Accused was seeking to make – namely, that the BAL trades entered by Mr Tai in the IB and Saxo accounts were “unauthorised” in the sense that neither the Relevant Accountholders nor the accused persons had instructed them. Third, the fact that Mr Tai had earned commission from the BAL trades carried out was not inconsistent with the alleged Scheme. Indeed, on Mr Tai’s evidence, it was the very incentive that led to him (and other TRs) to accepting instructions from the accused persons in the first place. Lastly, Mr Tai did not “admit” that it was “not necessary” for BAL shares to be rolled between the IB and Saxo accounts because the trades were “contracts for difference” (“CFDs”). In brief, CFDs are financial derivatives which allow a person to trade on the price movements of securities without having to acquire the underlying securities themselves.

[The First Accused’s argument] ignores [Mr Tai’s] evidence that there was a purpose to such trades, which was to help avoid what [Mr Tai] called a “V-shape” transaction, where, for instance, a DMG [& Partners] account sells to IB as part of the market roll, and IB then [sells] directly back to DMG [& Partners]. [Mr Tai] explained that such trades would attract the attention of the regulators, and as such, it would be better to use the Saxo accounts to take over these shares from IB before selling back to DMG [& Partners].

In cross-examination, [the First Accused] tried to challenge this by saying that the IB and Saxo accounts were merely intermediaries between [Mr Tjoa’s] [Phillip Securities] accounts and [Mr Gan’s] DMG [& Partners] accounts, which meant that there was no need to transact between IB and Saxo, as the shares could be sold from DMG [& Partners] to Saxo [and] [Phillip Securities] and still avoid a “V-shape” transaction.

 which meant, therefore that either IB or Saxo would still need to be interposed to avoid “V-shape” transactions.[footnotes included]697 I turn next to “ping-pong trades”. In respect of these, the First Accused made the following submissions:

Second, Ken Tai had admitted to carrying out “ping-pong” trades with Henry Tjoa. This would be what Ken Tai describes as coordinating market roll with Henry Tjoa. Ken Tai described these trades as “ping pong” trades as a method of rolling over between various accounts at different brokerages: for example, he would use the IB accounts to buy from Henry Tjoa’s [Phillip Securities] accounts, then sell from IB to Saxo accounts, then sell from Saxo accounts back to Henry Tjoa’s [Phillip Securities] accounts, and vice versa. In other words, the rollover is “like a little ping-pong match; as long as the ball is in the air, nobody has to pay for it”.…Aside from being unauthorised, these “ping-pong” trades were clearly illegal because Ken Tai and Henry Tjoa were just passing the shares back and forth without any real change in beneficial ownership. As mentioned above, Ken Tai had admitted that it was not necessary to roll-over or to engage in such wash trading between the [Relevant] Accounts. Further, Ken Tai also gave evidence that he was able to avoid detection by the authorities by using the Saxo and IB omnibus accounts. Yet again, this was done in order to churn the shares and generate commissions for both Ken Tai and Henry Tjoa.Once again, it is no coincidence that the months with the highest volume of “ping pong trades” are the months during which Ken Tai claims that the 1st Accused allegedly instructed him to engage in market operations.698 I did not accept these arguments, and therefore did not find them indicative of a commission-generating scam being run by Mr Tai (and Mr Tjoa) independent of and separate from the alleged Scheme. In general, I agreed with and accepted the Prosecution’s relatively comprehensive reply submissions on this issue,

 though, I thought that the critical flaw in the First Accused’s argument could be distilled down to a single point. It assumed that the fact of the “ping-pong trades” between Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa necessarily meant that – in executing these trades – the two had been acting on a frolic of their own, wholly outside the accused persons’ sphere of influence. This simply begged the prior question of why Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa had traded as they did and whether they had done so pursuant to the accused persons’ instructions and towards their objectives; or, whether they had done so for themselves. 699 It was evident from the last paragraph of the First Accused’s submissions (as reproduced at [697] above) that I was being urged to conclude that it was too convenient that these “ping-pong trades” took place during periods which the accused persons had allegedly directed Mr Tai to take over “market operations” and, therefore, that the fewer proximate communications between the accused persons and Mr Tai did not refute his claim. This, again, made a fundamental assumption that Mr Tai’s evidence in respect of “market operations” was a fabrication designed to conceal his own illicit BAL trading activity with Mr Tjoa, amongst others. The First Accused’s argument on “ping-pong trades” – and, in fact, his submissions more broadly – simply did not tackle this issue effectively in light of all the evidence which supported the existence of the “market operations” periods. Accordingly, the contention that these “ping-pong trades” ought to be construed as Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa acting wholly on their own volition for their own benefit did not have a foundation on which it could stand.700 Finally, I turn to the “scam trades”. For context, Mr Tai testified that he had not informed the accused persons that they could utilise the full trading limits granted by IB and Saxo to the Relevant Accounts. Instead, he informed them that they could only use three-quarters of the total limit.

 On this footing, the First Accused argued that some shares which could have been picked up using the accounts’ available margins were instead rolled over on a contra basis. This rolling, in turn, generated commission for Mr Tai. Thus, the First Accused said that, by concealing the full extent of the margins available to the accounts, Mr Tai had caused contra trades to be carried out when they did not have to be, thereby earning himself additional commission. The First Accused called these “scam trades” – that was, trades carried out by Mr Tai to benefit himself and “scam” the paying accountholders. More specifically, the First Accused made the following submissions:

[Ken Tai] repeatedly confessed that when he misled them about the need to do a rollover, he was in fact cheating them for his own benefit; Ken Tai had lied to the accused persons about the need to rollover trades at T+5 and the full trading limit available for these persons, when there was no need to rollover the trades in the Saxo and IB accounts.Ken Tai also admitted that he was doing such rollovers without instructions from January 2012, up till October 2012, and even after October 2012. It is clear that Ken Tai was acting for his own benefit from the onset. This admission was elicited during strenuous cross-examination. The real question is why Ken Tai did not state this in his investigation statements or conditioned statement, if he had indeed “come clean”. Given that he was lying in many material ways about his own involvement, why should he be believed when he lays all the blame upon the Accused Persons?In relation to the trades in the Algo Capital Group account, Ken Tai had admitted that he was not doing market operations directed by the 1st Accused; instead, he, together with Henry Tjoa and Gabriel Gan, were making money for themselves at the expense of the [Relevant Accountholders]. When questioned on the trades done in the Algo Capital Group account on 24 to 26 July 2013, Ken Tai admitted that he was running a “scam”. This was also concealed from the Accused Persons who did not have any idea of the “scam” carried out by the Manhattan House Group.The 1st Accused had no knowledge that Ken Tai was conducting such “scams”. The 1st Accused only first found out about this after he went through Ken Tai’s Kadar Statement and subsequently examined these trades in greater detail. Logically speaking, if the Accused Persons were controlling the accounts under Ken Tai and Ken Tai was carrying out their instructions, the Accused Persons would have known what was going on and the 1st Accused would never have allowed Ken Tai to benefit so brazenly for his personal gains at the expense of the [Relevant Accountholders], who were all part of the 1st Accused’s network of friends and co-investors.701 The Prosecution responded to these arguments on several fronts.

 The most important points they made were as follows. (a) First, there was good reason for Mr Tai to have kept this fact from the accused persons. As Mr Tai explained, he did so because the Second Accused had the propensity to maximise available trading limits. In the event the prices of BAL dropped, this placed the accounts at a high risk of being subject to a margin call. Thus, the unutilised margins served as a buffer to minimise this risk.

 There was simply no admission by Mr Tai that he had carried out such trades without the accused persons’ instructions or outside their alleged Scheme.702 In my view, the Prosecution’s responses did an adequate job countering the underlying point the First Accused sought to make in advancing the argument that Mr Tai had been involved in carrying out “scam trades”. That was, to show that Mr Tai had carried out, on his own volition, wrongful trades to “scam” the Relevant Accountholders and, thus, that he was not a witness of credit. The Prosecution’s responses showed that this point could not be borne out. For one, the supposed “admissions” by Mr Tai cited by the First Accused had not actually been made. Furthermore, there was enough to show that the accused persons had been aware of the issue during the Relevant Period. The fact that they had not done anything at the time strongly suggested that they themselves did not regard it as a problem and, at the very least, acquiesced Mr Tai’s conduct. Accordingly, there was little left to support the First Accused’s rather substantial submission that these so-called “scam trades” were an instance of Mr Tai acting as a rogue for his own benefit, wholly outside the accused persons’ control.703 In summary, I rejected the First Accused’s contentions that Mr Tai had engaged in “unauthorised trading”, “ping-pong trading” and “scam trading” with the Relevant Accounts held with IB and Saxo. I therefore reiterate my finding that the accused persons had controlled the 32 Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and IB under Mr Tai’s management. (3) Two accounts under Mr Gan704 I now turn to two Relevant Accounts held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Gan. These accounts were in the names of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez. The Prosecution’s case in respect of these accounts was twofold. First, both accused persons had given trading instructions directly to Mr Gan. Second, at certain points during the Relevant Period, they had additionally delegated the decision-making on the orders to place in these accounts to Mr Gwee, Mr Gan and Mr Tai.

705 As stated above in the course of my discussion on the Manhattan House Group generally, Mr Gan testified that the accused persons had been the ones giving him trading instructions for these two accounts (see [657], [670(b)] and [671] above). As far as the Relevant Period was concerned, from August 2012 to around May 2013, Mr Gan said that the accused persons’ instructions were specific. They would tell him the counter, the volume to buy or sell, as well as the price at which he should entered the order; indeed, there were even instances where the Second Accused would direct him to enter a single order or several smaller orders. Moreover, consistent with the nature of trading activity generally seen in the other controlled Relevant Accounts, Mr Gan also stated that the accused persons’ instructions were largely to trade on a rolling contra basis.

 However, as stated at [681]–[682] above, the manner in which Mr Gan conducted trades changed from around June 2013. This was when he stated that the accused persons had delegated the coordination of the market rolling activities for Asiasons (and, subsequently, also Blumont) to him, Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa. That said, in respect of LionGold trades, Mr Gan continued to take instructions directly from the Second Accused.706 The main question, of course, was whether Mr Gan’s evidence ought to be believed. As a starting point, it seemed to me that his testimony was corroborated by the GovTech Evidence. Indeed, the GovTech Evidence was telling not only because it corroborated Mr Gan’s evidence that the accused persons had been the ones giving instructions from the start of the Relevant Period until May 2013, but also because it supported his account that, from June to October 2013, the accused persons had delegated their “market operations” in respect of Blumont and Asiasons to him, Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa. During this latter period, the GovTech Evidence reflected a distinct drop in the number of trades in these two counters that had been preceded by communications from the accused persons,

707 There were also other pieces of objective evidence which supported Mr Gan’s account. (a) First, Mr Gan’s evidence as regards how the accused persons had settled contra losses in the two accounts under his management was wholly consistent with that discussed throughout these grounds. He said that, whenever there were outstanding losses to be settled, he would inform either accused person. Then, either he or the FI directly would receive payment from Mr Najib or Mr Jumaat.

 To this, she amended the amount of a pre-signed cheque for S$67 in Mr Lee CH’s name to S$200,000 and countersigned the amendment by forging Mr Lee CH’s signature. An image of this cheque was entered into evidence in support of Mr Gan’s account.

 as well as how the accused persons had made use of pre-signed cheques to make various payments (see [751]–[760] below).(b) Second, there was also an assortment of corroborative emails.

708 As mentioned, the Defence’s response in respect of Mr Gan was that he was one of the true rogues who had been manipulating the markets for and prices of BAL shares. He was said to have done so alongside Mr Gwee, Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa. As I stated from [683]–[687] above, I did not accept this general case. But that did not fully dispose of the issue of control because the Defence also contended that Mr Gan had taken instructions from the accountholders, Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez. This contention, as well as the more general question of whether the accused persons had controlled these two Relevant Accounts, could be answered by determining whether Mr Gan’s evidence ought to be accepted. In this connection, I turn to address the Defence’s applications to impeach his credibility.709 The First Accused’s application put forth four areas of inconsistency, while the Second Accused raised seven areas. There was a degree of overlap, and it is effective to reframe them into eight main areas as follows: (a) First, inconsistencies relating to the opening of the accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez. (b) Second, inconsistencies as regards whether Mr Fernandez had initially placed orders after the opening of his account. (c) Third, inconsistencies as regards whether Mr Gan had been granted discretion by Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez to place trades in their accounts. (d) Fourth, inconsistencies as regards whether, in 2010, whilst Mr Gan was still a TR in AmFraser Securities, Mr Neo and Mr Lee CH had verbally authorised Mr Gan to receive instructions from the Second Accused on their behalf. (e) Fifth, inconsistencies as regards whether Mr Gan had been aware of the matters which took place in the Dubai Room. (f) Sixth, inconsistencies as regards the extent to which Mr Gwee had been involved in the trades placed in the two accounts. (g) Seventh, an inconsistency as between Mr Gan’s claim in court that the Second Accused had forged Mr Lee CH’s signature on a cheque, and the evidence he gave to the CAD. (h) Lastly, Mr Gan’s failure to mention the fact that Mr Kam had been purchasing Asiasons shares in the days leading up to the Crash.710 I do not propose to deal with each of these areas of inconsistency as, by and large, they did not directly address the issue of whether the accused persons had exercised control over Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez’s accounts with DMG & Partners. In broad terms, however, I observed that while there were some material inconsistencies between positions Mr Gan took at trial and those he took when he had been interviewed by the CAD, I was satisfied that Mr Gan had adequately explained those inconsistencies. Accordingly, I did not find that his credibility was impeached. 711 The only matter which ought to be addressed in detail is the third area of inconsistency since it related specifically to the accused persons’ control of the two Relevant Accounts under Mr Gan’s management. In his investigation statements dated 20 November 2014

712 While this was material, I accepted Mr Gan’s explanation that he lied about this in his investigation statements. For one, it bears noting that Mr Gan’s interview on 20 November 2014 followed successful efforts by the First Accused to tamper with his evidence (see [1213]–[1225] below). Admittedly, the relevant Witness Tampering Charge did not concern this issue of Mr Gan’s alleged discretion to place trades in these two accounts. However, the fact that Mr Gan had been willing – at that stage – to lie to the CAD on the First Accused’s instructions, stood in strong support of Mr Gan’s explanation that he had lied to the CAD when he informed them that Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez had given him the discretion to place trades in their accounts.713 Mr Gan’s 15 February 2017 statement, however, does need to be addressed separately. The First Accused took issue with Mr Gan’s explanation that he had still been still lying on 15 February 2017 to protect the accused persons. By this time, the recordings which Mr Gan had secretly recorded of conversations with the First Accused had been seized by the authorities.

 On the First Accused’s submission, it would not have been possible that – to protect them – Mr Gan continued to maintain a denial of the accused persons’ involvement in the BAL trades placed in the accounts. Such denial would not have achieved anything in the face of those recordings. Although I appreciated the thrust of this argument, I did not accept it. The recordings made by Mr Gan did not evidence the full extent of the accused persons’ involvement, and, though, as I will discuss from [1213]–[1249] below, those recordings were inculpatory of the First Accused in so far as the Witness Tampering Charges were concerned, they were not particularly probative of the very many issues that arose in connection with the Conspiracy Charges. There was thus, in my view, nothing unbelievable about Mr Gan being hesitant to incriminate the accused persons in every aspect of the Scheme given their close association for a considerable period of time. Indeed, this was an aspect which did not feature in the recordings.714 Moreover, Mr Gan also explained that the authorisations which Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez had purportedly given him over the phone in September 2013 – which were recorded on his office landline

 – had been staged so as to satisfy compliance requirements set by DMG & Partners. The telecommunication records also showed that Mr Gan had called Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez on 1 September 2013 and this was likely to coach them on staging the calls that were ultimately recorded. Mr Gan made clear that the two accountholders had not actually given him discretion to trade, and, more pertinently, the BAL trades carried out in the accounts had either been instructed by the accused persons or executed under their auspices during the period which market rolling activities had been delegated to him as well as Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa.

 Thus, as I accepted Mr Gan’s explanation, I was satisfied that the First Accused had known about the fact that these calls had been staged.715 In the round, I found that Mr Gan’s testimony ought to be accepted as true – in particular, as it concerned the manner in which the accused persons had exercised control over the two Relevant Accounts under his management. It was cogently supported by both the GovTech Evidence as well as objective records. By contrast, the Second Accused offered no explanation of the account against her given her election, and the First Accused barely denied Mr Gan’s testimony without providing any explanation for the objective evidence.

 In my view, this was plainly insufficient. Accordingly, as against the case and evidence advanced by the Prosecution, the only meaningful defence mounted by the accused persons was their impeachment applications. As stated, I did not think that those applications were effective and I did not find Mr Gan’s credibility to have been impeached. Accordingly, on the basis of Mr Gan’s testimony – as supported by the other strands of evidence discussed – I found that the accused persons had both exercised control over the two Relevant Accounts under his management.

 As stated at [683]–[687] above, I rejected the contention that Mr Tai, Mr Gwee, Mr Gan, and Mr Tjoa were the actual rogues who had been engaging in illicit market manipulation activities. These individuals may have been carrying out illicit trading activity, but I found that they did so in furtherance of the accused persons’ objectives, pursuant to their directions, and in connection with their Scheme. Given this conclusion, the remaining question to be answered was simply whether I ought to accept Mr Tjoa’s testimony. To persuade me that I should not, the Second Accused took out an impeachment application against him.722 This application relied on two areas of material inconsistency. (a) First, in his testimony, Mr Tjoa said that the accused persons’ “rolling activities in BAL shares differed from a pattern of genuine contra trading”,

 Mr Tjoa was also referred to his statement dated 23 August 2017 which suggested that he had already informed the CAD about the accused persons’ involvement with the accounts and, so, he would not have had a reason to lie in his 6 October 2017 statement.

723 These were plainly material inconsistencies. As such, the question which needed to be answered was whether Mr Tjoa’s explanation of the discrepancies should be accepted. In respect of both areas of inconsistency, Mr Tjoa explained that the accused persons had told him to lie and to deny their involvement in the BAL trades. He claimed that he had been told to say that the accountholders had given him standing instructions to trade BAL shares on a rolling contra basis. Therefore, he connectedly had to say that it was common for contra trading to be carried out in this manner. Further, after he had complied with the First Accused’s instructions, Mr Tjoa explained that he had given the First Accused notes of his interview.724 As regards why Mr Tjoa had complied with the First Accused’s instructions, he explained that he did so because he was relying on the First Accused to repay the millions of dollars of losses suffered in the accounts following the Crash and, further, that he also did not wish to implicate himself. However, by the time the accused persons had been charged in November 2016, Mr Tjoa determined that it was best to reveal the accused persons’ involvement with the BAL trades in the accounts and come clean about his own actions. In doing so, he implicated himself but, nevertheless, still did not wish to disclose the involvement of Mr Tai, Mr Gwee, Mr Gan, as well as his assistants, who, unlike the accused persons, had not been charged. Therefore, Mr Tjoa said, he continued to lie in relation to some aspects in the statements recorded by the CAD from him in 2017 and 2018, specifically, that he had standing instructions from the accountholders at the time to roll over their contra positions in BAL. On Mr Tjoa’s account, he maintained this position because Mr Tai had been the one giving instructions for the accounts at that time, and he did not wish to implicate him in the trading activity.725 I disagreed with the Second Accused that Mr Tjoa’s reasons were unsatisfactory. In court, Mr Tjoa candidly admitted to his deliberate lies in the investigation statements. For example, he admitted that – with the First Accused’s help to support his story – he had produced fabricated documents to the investigating authorities to falsely show that Mr Tan BK and Mr Lau SL had given him standing instructions as to the trades in their accounts.

 Indeed, his evidence of how the First Accused had influenced him to conceal the truth of the accused persons’ involvement in the relevant BAL trades was, in my view, consistent with the pattern of the First Accused’s behaviour as described by other witnesses, especially those forming the subject of Witness Tampering Charges. Furthermore – contrary to the Second Accused’s submission – it was also not unbelievable that, while Mr Tjoa had decided to own up to some aspects of the wrongdoing in late 2016, he remained unforthcoming about other matters which implicated other persons. I could appreciate his reasoning that the accused persons had been charged but not Mr Tai and the others. Therefore, I did not find Mr Tjoa’s credit to be impeached.726 That being said, I recognised Mr Tjoa’s fairly unique role in the accused persons’ Scheme and, accordingly, I weighed his testimony carefully in light of all of the evidence, both contrary to and corroborative of his account. After doing so, I found that it was appropriate to accept his evidence that the accused persons had been in control of the 27 Relevant Accounts held with Phillip Securities under his management.Summary of my findings on Issue 1727 In summary, for the many reasons set out above, I found that the accused persons had obtained and exercised controlled over 187 of the 189 Relevant Accounts. The manner in and extent to which they exercised control over each of these 187 accounts was somewhat varied, but there was ample evidence to establish that they had put such control towards some common purpose involving the sale, purchase, and holding of BAL shares. The accounts which I found had not been controlled by the accused persons were Ms Cheng’s two personal accounts – one held with CIMB (see [420]–[427] above) and the other with Credit Suisse (see [600]–[616] above).Issue 2: Was the accused persons’ control of the accounts coordinated?728 I turn to the second issue stated at [192(b)] above – whether the accused persons had coordinated and managed their use of the Relevant Accounts under their control, and, if so, how they had done so. In this regard, the Prosecution raised three strands of evidence to make the point that the Relevant Accounts had formed a “network”.

 729 Apart from these three strands, however, there were, in my view, four others which also supported the conclusion that the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts had been coordinated. The first was the way the accused persons had set out to gather as many trading accounts as possible. The second was the fact that many TRs had reported trades to them in a manner which did not seem to distinguish between individual accounts. The third was the fact that they had been involved in securing the trade financing for some Relevant Accounts. And the last included communications between the accused persons, as well as between the First Accused and Ms Cheng which were revealing of the fact that there existed a coordinated scheme of control. I address all seven areas in this sub-section. I note that aspects of all these strands have been raised in the extensive discussion in relation to the first issue on the control of the accounts. Therefore, I can be brief. The gathering of trading accounts730 The evidence showed that the accused persons had set out to gather as many accounts as they could to bring under their control. I set out some examples, though I should emphasise that there was other evidence which supported this conclusion.

732 Similarly strong evidence that the accused persons had wanted to pull as many trading accounts under their control as possible was given by Mr Tai. Specifically, his evidence in relation to the setting up of the Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and IB. As regards trading in CFDs with Saxo, Mr Tai’s evidence was that he had explained the operation of CFDs to the accused persons. As mentioned at [696] above, CFDs are financial derivatives which allow a person to trade on the price movements of securities without having to acquire the underlying securities themselves. Mr Tai explained that he had thought the accused persons would be interested because trading in CFDs would allow them to engage in high volume trading without a large initial cash outlay.

733 In fact, the evidence also showed that the accused persons did not only cause their associates to open trading accounts. As set out at [338(d)] above, Mr Lincoln Lee testified that the accused persons were also content to coordinate their BAL trading activity with accounts in various FIs belonging to individuals with whom they had no prior connection or relationship. On Mr Lincoln Lee’s evidence, those TRs and accountholders were simply incentivised to carry out nominee trades because the accused persons had agreed to cover contra losses while allowing the TRs and accountholders to retain contra profits. 734 As a final example, as set out at [449]–[454] above, Mr Wong XY’s evidence also strongly supported the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had set out to gather as many trading accounts as they could. 735 Thus, these testimonies, in my judgment, pointed sharply and clearly towards the existence of some underlying scheme. Both retail and commercial investors are certainly entitled to search for financial institutions willing to provide terms most suitable to their investment objectives and needs. However, the fact that the accused persons had been involved in the opening of so many accounts for so many individuals in so many FIs, suggested that this was not an exercise in legitimate “FI-hunting”, as it were. On the contrary, it was clear from the evidence of these witnesses that the accused persons had intended to use the many trading accounts gathered for some broader plan.The reporting of trades to the accused persons736 I have explained trade reporting at [56]–[59] above and I cited Mr Jack Ng’s evidence as an illustration of a TR who provided trade reports to the accused persons. There were other TRs as well as intermediaries who gave evidence that they had reported trades to the accused persons in the same or a largely similar manner. This included Mr Alex Chew,

 737 The Defence highlighted that the accused persons either entirely did not receive, or did not receive consistent and complete trade reports on a daily basis from each and every TR. This was significant because, without complete, consistent, and accurate trade reports, the accused persons would not have been able to carry out the elaborate and complex scheme alleged by the Prosecution. 738 For example, the Defence highlighted that, in respect of Mr Jack Ng, the telecommunications data shows that there were simply no messages from Mr Jack Ng to either accused person between August and December 2012, and, again, between February and March 2013. Naturally, in respect of each TR as well as the intermediaries, the position was different. In my view, a granular analysis of every TR’s trade reports, when such trade reports might have not been made, and whether the dates on which they had not been made significantly impaired the accused persons’ alleged ability to coordinate their control of the Relevant Accounts, was not necessary to give the Defence its full and proper consideration.739 I have addressed the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts above, and those findings were premised on more than the mere fact of trade reports having been given by the TRs and intermediaries. Once control had been established proper, these granular variations and the lack of perfect trade reporting was not a point that affected the accused persons’ defence. 740 It was the fact of such trade reports at all that was significant. Naturally, I accepted that it would have been easier for the accused persons to coordinate their control of the Relevant Accounts if they had perfect – or, at least more consistent and complete – information from the TRs and intermediaries. That said, it was entirely feasible for the accused persons to have coordinated their control without consistent and complete trade reports. They simply needed to have enough important information.741 For example, where the cash accounts held with local brokerages were concerned, trades were typically conducted on a contra basis. Whenever such trades were due for payment or sale, the TRs did ordinarily inform the accused persons (or, in some cases, the accountholders, who would then relay this information to the accused persons), who could then decide what trade orders to place next. There was no suggestion that the accused persons were so deprived of information that even the straightforward rolling over of trades could not be carried out. Therefore, in so far as the issue of coordination was concerned, my view was that the accused persons overstated the importance of perfect trade reporting. Indeed, quite to the contrary, not only did I think it was unnecessary for the Prosecution to prove perfect trade reporting in order to support the inference that there was coordination, it was more pertinent for the accused persons to explain why, at all, they were the recipients of any trade reports for accounts which did not even belong to them.742 On that note, Ms Poon’s evidence is usefully cited as another example. On her account, the Second Accused would call her mobile phone to give trading instructions. Given that the Second Accused elected not to take the stand, she did not explain why she was giving why she was receiving trade reports at all. Even if I had accepted that Ms Poon had failed to provide the Second Accused with perfectly consistent daily trade reports, or even generally consistent daily trade reports, that did not detract from the more puzzling issue of why the Second Accused had been interacting with Ms Poon in this manner at all (or, indeed, why the accused persons were more generally interacting with numerous TRs in this manner). As I have explained when discussing the issue of control, the First Accused was unable to furnish credible explanations of his dealings with the TRs despite him giving evidence. Specifically, he was not able to proffer a legitimate and credible explanation for why TRs had reported trades executed in the Relevant Accounts to him at all.743 Thus, having considered the evidence of the TRs individually and in the round, I was satisfied that the fact of trade reporting, where identified to have occurred, went towards supporting the inference that there existed some broad scheme devised by the accused persons. Tracking the shareholdings of some Relevant Accounts744 I mentioned and explained the contents of the Shareholding Schedule

 to prepare these spreadsheets. This was, he said, in preparation for potential general offers (“GO”), mergers, or take-over bids involving the companies whose shareholdings were being tracked in the spreadsheet. On his account, they wanted to keep track of “friendly parties”.

745 Although I could understand the need to keep track of “friendly” shareholders in potential GO, merger, or take-over situations, this simply did not explain the actual contents of the Shareholding Schedule. A key characteristic of the Shareholding Schedule was that they contained not only detailed information about the shareholding of various accountholders, but the specific accounts in which such shares were being held. Such granular information plainly did not support the First Accused’s explanation. After all, if all one truly cared about was who might or might not vote in favour of a GO, merger, or take-over, that was information which could be ascertained from the fact and extent of a particular person or company’s shareholding. It hardly mattered where those shares were kept. 746 The First Accused’s explanation of this was that the persons who prepared the document, Mr Goh HC and Ms Chiam, took the initiative to go above and beyond what was required of them. In his words, “I think it’s probably the compiler … trying to be as accurate as possible”; “there is something to be said for initiative … I don’t micromanage, if they go beyond the extra mile to do what they do. As far as I’m concerned, I require to know whether, if there’s a GO, we can deliver 51 per cent”.

 747 This, in my view, was a rather flimsy explanation. As mentioned at [60] above, there were multiple iterations of the Shareholding Schedule. It was revised as and when updated statements from these “friendly parties” were made available to the compilers. If Mr Goh HC and Ms Chiam had indeed gone so far beyond the scope of what they had been asked to do, there was no reason for the accused persons to have allowed them to continue undertaking such unnecessary work in subsequent versions. Indeed, there was something to be said for reducing the unnecessary detail of the Shareholding Schedule if it had truly been for the purpose suggested by the First Accused. Even a cursory review of the spreadsheet revealed that it contained a great deal of unnecessary detail which arguably made it harder to use for the purpose suggested by the First Accused. Though he “did not micromanage”, there was nothing stopping either him or the Second Accused from asking Mr Goh HC and Ms Chiam to simplify the spreadsheet to make it better suited for its purpose. 748 In any event, the Shareholding Schedule also captured information such as whether the shares in question were being used as “collateral”, whether they had been “locked up”, or whether they were being traded in the market. I could not see any connection between such information and its supposed function. In fact, unlike the location of each accountholder’s shares, a specific effort would have been required for such information to be obtained and, thus, recorded. As such, unless Mr Goh HC and Ms Chiam had been specifically directed to include such information in the Shareholding Schedule, it seemed very unlikely that they would have gone out of their way to do so.749 Accordingly, I did not accept the First Accused’s explanation and took the view that there was something to be inferred from the fact of the Shareholding Schedule’s existence, particularly in light of the fact that the First Accused did not deny that it had been prepared by Mr Goh HC and Ms Chiam upon his and the Second Accused’s instructions. The Shareholding Schedule indicated to me that there was some kind of coordination which underpinned the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts. Being mindful of the BAL shares they had purchased using the various Relevant Accounts would likely have helped them coordinate their control. 750 I was mindful that the Shareholding Schedule was not a perfect reflection of the Relevant Accounts and Relevant Accountholders. However, as I rejected the First Accused’s explanation of the nature of the Shareholding Schedule, the fact that the record was imperfect only went towards the evidential weight I could give it. Tracking and paying the contra losses of some Relevant Accounts751 Another salient document was Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet, which I have mentioned at [111] above.

 This was a spreadsheet which appeared to track the payment of contra losses suffered in the Relevant Accounts. To explain, I will use Mr Jack Ng as an example. 752 As set out at [377] above, Mr Jack Ng gave evidence that prior to the Crash, there were occasions on which the Second Accused would settle the contra losses suffered in the eight Relevant Accounts under his management. Either Mr Najib or Mr Jumaat would deliver cheques or cash, and when they arrived at OCBC Securities’ office, Mr Jack Ng would direct them to the cashier.

753 These payments, amongst others, had been recorded in Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet. Naturally, the questions which arose were: (a) what this spreadsheet was supposed to reflect; and (b) why Mr Goh HC had been recording such payments. I take them in turn. 754 On the “what”, Mr Goh HC testified that this spreadsheet was the ledger of a “petty cash float” (the “Float”) he had maintained in the safe of IPCO’s office.

 Cash was taken out from the Float and paid to Mr Goh HC and Ms Huang whenever contra losses had been suffered in their accounts, and, whenever their accounts made contra gains, the cash was put into the Float by Mr Goh HC. However, on Mr Goh’s account, as time went on, “more activities [came] up” and he continued to use the same spreadsheet to keep track of them.

755 As to “why” he had been recording such payments, Mr Goh HC’s evidence was somewhat favourable to the accused persons. Mr Goh HC testified that he had not been instructed by the accused persons to create or maintain this document. He even stated specifically that the accused persons would not have known of the existence of this spreadsheet, though from parts of his evidence, it appeared that he may have shown sections of it to the Second Accused.

 756 Nevertheless, even accepting that the accused persons had not known about this spreadsheet, there was still Mr Goh HC’s unequivocal evidence that the Float which this spreadsheet reflected had been maintained using contra gains made in his and his wife’s trading accounts, as well as other sources which had been secured by the accused persons. These included cash drawn from the Second Accused or her mother’s personal bank accounts, as well as those of other Relevant Accountholders, such as Mr Neo, Mr Lee CH, Dato Idris, Mr Ong KL, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Sugiarto. The principal way in which cash had been obtained from the accounts of these individuals was using blank, pre-signed cheques kept in a safe in IPCO’s office.

 I accepted, on Mr Goh HC’s evidence, that the accused persons probably had not been aware of the existence of the spreadsheet. Further, it was also clear to me that this was not a complete or thorough document. Nor was it a document which had served the single function of keeping track of the payments in relation to certain Relevant Accounts. This much was evident from the fact that it even kept track of payments for food purchased by or for Mr Najib (see [754] above). 758 However, these points did not quite answer Mr Goh HC’s evidence as regards the Float itself; namely, that the Float had been maintained to make payment for contra losses suffered in trading accounts, including many Relevant Accounts. The fact of this peculiar arrangement alone begged the question of why such an arrangement existed between the accused persons, Mr Neo, Mr Lee CH, Dato Idris, etc; and, thus, what precisely Mr Goh HC was recording by way of the spreadsheet. On my consideration of the totality of the evidence, I found that the fact of Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet, coupled with his testimony as regards what he had been recording, demonstrated that the accused persons had been managing the finances of the Relevant Accounts for the Scheme.759 The entries in the spreadsheet which were particularly reflective of this conclusion, were those in respect of Relevant Accountholders with whom Mr Goh HC did not even have a personal relationship. Take, for example, an entry which records a payment of S$3,375,695.67. Under the heading “Idris”, this sum was described as “Funds received from Sales of Proceeds”.

 (a) “Funds transfer to Goh”; (b) “Funds transfer to James”; (c) “Funds transfer to Suling”; and (d) “Funds transfer to Neo”. These transfers had been made for S$820,000, S$600,000, S$600,000, and S$1,350,000 respectively. On Mr Goh HC’s account, he did not know Dato Idris personally,

 and the First Accused had been the one who instructed him to issue pre-signed cheques to make payments out of Dato Idris’ bank account.760 In view of the character of the spreadsheet, and Mr Goh HC’s evidence as to what it was supposed to reflect, I considered the spreadsheet to be an indicium of an underlying arrangement which shows the existence of the Scheme as framed by the Prosecution. For completeness, I should highlight that the First Accused had offered several other explanations as regards what Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet supposedly captured or reflected. These explanations were wholly incredible as the Prosecution rightly submitted,

 and, therefore, I do not propose to state or address them in these grounds. It suffices to say that I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions and rejected those explanations accordingly. Treating BAL shares in the Relevant Accounts as part of a pool761 In support of its case that the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts was coordinated, the Prosecution submitted that the accused persons dealt with the BAL shares held in those accounts as a common pool. More specifically, it was asserted that the accused persons had: (a) moved BAL shares between the Relevant Accounts “as necessary for various purposes”, including for financing and collateral arrangements; (b) parked shares in various Relevant Accounts “to facilitate the holding of these shares”; and (c) managed the BAL trading activity in the Relevant Accounts as a group.

 762 I accepted this submission, based on three pieces of evidence which related to Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold shares respectively. 763 First, on 8 November 2012, Ms Cheng sent an email to the accused persons stating that she had secured an arrangement with UBS in relation to Neptune Capital’s account,

 by which UBS would not charge or sell Blumont shares held in the account. Ms Cheng then went on to say that this was “an account to park … shares, without fees or lien”.

 Referring to this, the Prosecution suggested that the word “park” indicated that any Blumont shares placed in the account did not belong to Neptune Capital but, rather, the accused persons who needed various venues to house their BAL shares without them being subject to potential use or sale by the FI.

 needed to be informed of this arrangement. In the round, this email strongly suggested that the provenance of the BAL shares placed in the various Relevant Accounts was not important because the accused persons freely moved them from account to account as was necessary or beneficial. 764 Second, as discussed from [594]–[595] above, Mr Hong and Mr William Chan’s evidence showed that – shortly after the Second Accused and Mr Hong had opened accounts with Goldman Sachs

 in February 2013 – the First Accused made arrangements for approximately 20 million Asiasons shares to be deposited into each of their accounts as collateral for the provision of margin financing. In May 2013, a further 10 million Asiasons shares were deposited into each of the accounts and more margin financing was provided by Goldman Sachs. These shares had been assigned from other Relevant Accountholders. They were then transferred from Mr Hong’s CDP account into his Goldman Sachs account on 15, 19 and 25 March 2013.

 pointed firmly towards the conclusion that Mr Hong’s suggestion that the assignments may have been premised on sale and purchase agreements was very unlikely to be true. As stated at [204] and [371] respectively, I found Mr Chen a generally credible and forthright witness, but Mr Hong was not. Therefore, as the Prosecution advanced, there appeared to be a common pool of Asiasons shares held in various Relevant Accounts, over which at least the First Accused exercised coordinated control.767 Third, on 9 December 2012, Ms Cheng forwarded to the Second Accused (copying the First Accused) an email from Credit Suisse in which the FI said that it was intending to reduce the loan-to-value ratio and concentration risk tolerance

This, they said, suggested that Ms Cheng and the accused persons “understood that the identities of the accountholders did not matter” and that they were “simply nominee accounts used to house shares that belonged to the accused persons”. Moreover, the statement that the accused persons’ shares ought to be “spread out” also indicated that the arrangements discussed were meant to enable the distribution of shares from a common source managed by the accused persons.

 she testified that the “3rd acct & other accts” referred to “cornerstone investors” who were apparently intending to open accounts with Credit Suisse to buy into LionGold shares. These “cornerstone investors”, Ms Cheng said, included “for example, Mr Neo, who has a significant office in Blumont, and other significant politically-linked people that they kn[e]w”. The purpose of bringing such individuals into the mix was to show Credit Suisse that there were “good investors” buying into LionGold. When asked why then there was a need to “spread out your shares” [emphasis added], Ms Cheng stated that it was beneficial, ostensibly for the loan-to-value ratio and concentration risk tolerance which LionGold shares attracted, for Credit Suisse to see that there were other significant investors. It would have given the FI comfort, she said.

 770 None of this, however, answered why Ms Cheng had said that there was a need for shares to be “spread out” from the accused persons. If the point of bringing high-profile investors into the fold of trading in LionGold shares was to increase Credit Suisse’s confidence in the share as collateral, one would generally expect those investors to pick up shares from the open market or, if the situation permitted, from placements, allotments or private sales. It made little sense for LionGold shares which had already been purchased, presumably in the Second Accused’s Credit Suisse account, to simply be “spread out” to those investors. In any case, the fact that Ms Cheng advised “spread[ing] out” LionGold shares to other accountholders at all, supported the conclusion that the shares were regarded as part of a pool to be used for ulterior purposes other than legitimate investment.771 On the whole, I found that there was an abundance of evidence to support the Prosecution’s averment that the accused persons could and did regard the BAL shares held in various Relevant Accounts as part of a pool to be tapped on whenever they were needed. It did not matter in whose account the BAL shares were placed per se, so long as they were placed in an account or location which suited some other broader need. This was plainly illegitimate and supported the view that the underlying Scheme existed.Involvement in the securing of trade financing772 As would have been gathered from my discussion of control, particularly in relation to the Foreign Accounts, though many of the Relevant Accounts had traded on a contra basis, there were also many that had been granted margin facilities. There was evidence to show that the accused persons had been involved in the procurement of such facilities, and no example was clearer than in relation to the six Goldman Sachs and IB accounts which formed the subject of the Cheating Charges. As I will explain from [1115]–[1157] below, I found the accused persons had not only entered the conspiracies underlying the Cheating Charges, but that the substantive offences had also been completed. Those findings, in turn, supported the view that the accused persons had coordinated the control of the Relevant Accounts. After all, it was one thing for the accused persons to simply use the accounts, it was another for them to systematically move shares from location to location in order to obtain margin facilities. As another example, see [552]–[555] above in relation to the RBC accounts of Mr Hong, Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez. This was a fact I took into account when assessing the existence of the overall Scheme alleged.Key communications with and between the accused persons773 In respect of the communications with and between the accused persons, work had to be done to place the bulk of them within some context for them to be analysed and understood. Those communications, where relevant, would have been discussed in connection with the question of control at [194]–[727] above. This subsection is concerned with communications which, even without much context or detailed analysis, hinted strongly at the Scheme. In my view, there were two such communications.774 The first was an email sent by the Second Accused to the First Accused on 19 May 2013 titled, “compromised… Fw: All guns to the battlefield” (I refer to this as the “All Guns Email”).

 Although lengthy, I reproduce the email in full. Its contents, its tone and its choice of words, in my view, shed considerable light on the inner mechanics of the accused persons’ relationship, and, more importantly (as this matter concerned charges for criminal conspiracy), the Second Accused’s state of mind.Dear John,I write this with a heavy heart. This is not a letter to complain but rather express my feelings about the situation at hand.And in the process i know i will also expose to you how small a person i am and my bitchiness and pettiness. (which of cos.. you already know too…)But more importantly i hope you will be able to guide me and perhaps help me with my “sim luan luan”. I feel like i am like a kid complaining to the father. Hoping that the father will be able to say something to comfort her.You are the father, you have many kids to look after. And it is difficult for you to also manage so many kids with so many grievances, eccentricities etc…From Day one. I have been grateful to you for giving me a chance to shine and to lead. I never had lofty ambitions – my basic needs: a salary a home and kids and perhaps to beat the system in the stock market… And as i told many, things just fell on my lap -- i never jostled for directorship (even after doing the innopac war, no expectation of a reward -- or any thought of being on inno board -- (stupid). My reward was that we could put back the right -- clean up the “money grabbing directors” who disrespected your wishes/your lead/your charge… That had been my satisfaction. That we won the fight/war/struggle.But somehow you thought i could contribute in Ipco and etc.. Although there is not many more wars to fight, outwardly, .. Every day i still fight… to take care of what is yours and preserve it. You are the owner and i am merely the caretaker.I take care of the groups needs. I think i may have been overzealous in protecting your interest that i may have overlook rewarding IPCo staff and all.You see, less for us, means more for you, more for the group. It is afterall, the big picture that we have to look at, as you have taught me.Because i am that way, i sort of expect all in the group to have this mindset. But i realised not every one is the same. And as you have said to me (i heed your advice).. “dont expect people to act or think the way you do..”Today’s revealation, how liongold management doles out big angpows to directors (188) and staff (??) … first it was a shock -- to me it was excessive: in Ipco, hoikong laisee is 10 dollars and my board of directors each get a box of “kum” for chinese new year.The audacity of it all… whose money are they spending? Shareholders money.. Liongold.. i go into the company -- they spend so much on unnecessary items, small matter you say.. but it is not about the dollar value but the culture, the mentality.. like 8 dollar starbucks coffee you dont want to pay thing.. (it is what hokkien say -- szing or wastage)Sorry, i am being too protective.. My First instinct has always been to preserve cash in Company. So that we can buy more lion gold, asiasons and whatever that you need... I have been blinded by my feelings for you. EVERYTHING, you rank first... Is this healthy. Is my mandate skewed because of my feelings for you? Am i being fair to my staff and all..?Is it time to adjust salaries and give all bigger angpows this year? Have i been so blindsided?then i look at even bigger picture: We are still not out of the woods> Ipco needs to plough in all it has to help the “family”.And here is the bit that i feel “dendam” and THAM TOO..That Lion Gold with a cash hoard of S$22m is allowed to keep this intact so that they can be seen as a generous employer – JUST THE contract salary (not inclusive of bonuses) range from 50k to 23k per month. And there is talk about amending the contract to include sign on bonus since they could not justify the “performance” bit for the share issuance.Everyday, private money (your funds) is supporting the market roll of Lion Gold. We are absorbing shares that corporate have so successfully placed out. I want to remind all of the original plan… Lion Gold placement money was to come back and defend the market. I am still waiting for the calvary to come. Until this is resolved, there should not be any celebration or any party. I feel that in Lion Gold, there is a party on. Everyday the company buys lunch because raymond says the kopi tiam is 10 mins walk away… and staff cannot go.. (hello... in hk we walk to our lunch venue .. company dont buy our meals unless it is overtime)Then the increase in directors fee, (after a substantial increase) and performance bonus etc.. why are they draining the company’s resources so fast? When everyone knows that the group needs all its resouces.. HELLO? There is a situation out here and you are needed to buy arms to fight the war but instead you are having a party?On the other end of the coin -- ISR.. has trouble paying the brokers. Su Yin gets the tsk tsk when she brings up the 10m board approval thing. Su Yin understands the situation and has also been trying to meet all this. You have to understand that unlike Lion or Ipco, her board is not so friendly and dont always respond. I know she is stressed about this but she still goes around things and situations to get it done for you.. Because ultimately she also feels the same way – preserve cash in company for your use.I am not defending Suyin cos she is my sister. I know you are not as fond of her and tire of her when she speaks too much too long. But i want to say she is trying her best -- which is actually a surprise to me because she is such a “dot your I’s and cross your t’s” person… Like me, she also tries to preserve and prudent spending only.. Please remember that we all respect you and your needs come before anybody else’s. And ALL of us are preserving resources to be used by the group… except.. the one still delusional and having a party..You know, when i heard about the salary pay for each lion gold employee … i was angry at first -- how could they... and i was demoralised.. (Lesley bendig is getting 23k a month -- more than ISR CEO who has more fidicury duty to fulfill...) I was so enraged and disgusted with lion that in the end i thought i should just join in their game.. i thought if they can do it -- so can i.. I should give everyone a raise in ipco to be on par. We have 45m and i should be able to splurge on bonuses and angpows this year. And raise all salaries and also renovate my office…But you know what? I cannot bring myself to do it. SIM THEAH…So i am so so so so troubled.. I dont want to feel so THAM too and all and it is something that i am grappling with…I cannot tahan when there is “injustice” in the system..That was what got me onto the Innopac case.. People taking advantage of a situation.I just feel that some people in Liongold is taking advantage of the power that they have been bestowed upon. And also there is too much cash in the company -- they get crazy thinking how to spend it on themselves or indirectly to buy respect and allegiance from their staff and directors.I dont know if you know how difficult it is for me to overlook this… Every one is looking at IPCO’s money.. Lesley bendig even once told me.. NYGT 16m (before convertibles happened)… “this will solve our problem...”Why hasnt the 22m in Lion G gone to solve any problem… you are all just looking at other peoples plate and wanting to grab from them while you preserve your own plate so that you have a feast to feed on.I shall stop here.. i shant go onto contra losses ITE G1 etc.. will have to mete out -- from private funds… they are just the operating costs i treat it as..I hope you will be able to drive the same culture in the family. While there is a war, all guns to the battlefield.. none should be left in the store.And no one should partake the spoils of war.. it is only for the General and Chief to mete out…[emphasis added in bold italics]775 The second is a recording of a conversation between the First Accused and Ms Cheng which took place on 27 May 2013.

 The conversation was approximately two hours long and was, by and large, in the nature of a heated quarrel between lovers. On this note, I should explain that the accused persons were romantically involved for a period of time. However, during the Relevant Period, the First Accused was also concurrently in a romantic relationship with Ms Cheng. In was broadly in this context, that the First Accused and Ms Cheng had been quarrelling in the recording, and it is not necessary to state the specifics in any greater detail than this. For propriety, and also because of the length of their conversation, I will not reproduce the conversation in full. Instead, only relevant segments are set out from its transcript:

You never have breakfast with me.First Accused: That’s bulls—.Ms Cheng: And you do that with her. Why? Why do I get a different treatment? Because she enjoys eating breakfast?

And then have breakfast with me?First Accused: Because I can’t, because most of the brokers are her one. I have to tell them “Do this, do this, buy here, buy there, buy, buy buy buy and so forth. The brokers are her contacts, okay?…Ms Cheng: Between me and her?…First Accused: Between -- what I voluntarily do, and what I am -- what I had no choice but to do for the [inaudible], okay?

You may be mistaken or whatever, fair enough -- but it wasn’t -- or maybe there was a particularly bad day and there was -- I don’t know maybe that was the time when gold crashed, I don’t know! But if there is then you ask [inaudible] we were trading in a room. There is no such thing, alright? I can’t remember but, the only reason, if ever there was, intensive, or somebody shorted our stock.

We must have been really strapped in the market, alright? I don’t know. If I -- if I -- If I ask you to buy anything for me in those few days, it means we’re under heavy pressure.Ms Cheng: And you spent two and a half hours with her after that?First Accused: It would have been -- If I did, and I cannot remember though, if I did -- it would have been some meeting or it would have been some intensive [inaudible] market management.Ms Cheng: Honey -- you after 4:30 didn’t even check out, and then you went to Subang parade with her. And then you walk into “caring”. And then after that, you went to family restaurant. And then after that, you drive her to the airport, you didn’t even drop her, even went down with her. And then you were sitting at Starbucks for another one hour from six to seven.First Accused: I cannot remember, okay? It must have been an emergency, alright?Ms Cheng: What emergency?First Accused: Probably a -- out of lines with the market or whatever or --Ms Cheng: You looked pretty relaxed.…[They discuss the accused persons’ relationship]Ms Cheng: Okay, and then we’ll be stuck with her right?First Accused: I am -- I have no intention of, even before you, I had at least, 20 times wanted to get out, but I couldn’t.Ms Cheng: But you didn’t.First Accused: I didn’t because I couldn’t!

Look -- you came from a privileged [inaudible] you don’t -- you don’t understand the -- that any mistake can crash the whole thing and with it all the people and all the hard work we put it in, alright?…First Accused: So I’m trying to tell you, everyday if we don’t do the thing we crash by 5 o’clock, we crash, alright?…[They discuss several other matters before returning to the accused persons’ relationship]First Accused: No it’s not true. I don’t see her the whole day. You pluck a date like that and expect me to remember how the hell do I remember? If it really happened, it must have been a really crisis day. Market crash, I can’t get out of the market.Ms Cheng: It must have been an easy day otherwise you wouldn’t leave trading, and leave the room --First Accused: It isn’t okay, I have put all my instruction there and I go do all the [inaudible] and before the 5 o’clock meeting.…First Accused: … Try to understand, it’s not that I don’t [inaudible] I need half an hour to get [inaudible] because market hasn’t done a lot of things in the past 2 to 3 hours. So try to understand it’s not that I don’t -- if I don’t give the orders, the whole thing -- everybody panics.[emphasis added in italics]776 The All Guns Email and the contents of the First Accused’s quarrel with Ms Cheng plainly revealed that certain illegitimate trading activities had been taking place. Indeed, in my view, they spoke for themselves, which is precisely why I have reproduced the entire All Guns Email and substantial portions of the transcribed quarrel. In assessing the existence of the overall Scheme alleged by the Prosecution, I bore the fact and contents of these communications firmly in mind. Summary of my findings on Issue 2777 In my view, the evidence overwhelmingly indicated that the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts had been coordinated. The evidence showed: (a) that the accused persons had taken steps to gather a large number of trading accounts; (b) that they had received trade reports from TRs in relation to accounts they had no legitimate business handling; (c) that they had been tracking the shareholdings of many, albeit not all, Relevant Accounts; (d) that they had been tracking and paying the contra losses suffered in accounts they, again, had no business handling; (e) that they had treated the BAL shares in the Relevant Accounts as though they were part of a common pool; and (f) that they had been involved in securing trading financing for several Relevant Accounts. These points were capped off with key pieces of communications that strongly suggested that the accused persons had been engaging in some kind of illegitimate trading practices. Issue 3: Did the Relevant Accounts use illegitimate trading practices?778 In this subsection, I set out the types of illegitimate trading practices allegedly used by the accused persons through their control of the Relevant Accounts to inflate the markets for BAL shares. These were, essentially, the various trading practices Professor Aitken specifically identified as illegitimate on the footing that the 189 Relevant Accounts had been controlled by a single group or individual using the accounts in concert. I will also highlight certain oppositions raised by the Defence’s expert, Mr White. Before I do so, however, I need to address a fundamental objection the Defence had with Professor Aitken’s terms of reference. 779 Using his terms of reference in respect of Blumont as an example:
                   1840




Foot Note 1840

×



  MJA-1, Schedule A. 



In your analysis, you should assume that:3.1 the Accounts were controlled by common persons.3.2 The common persons controlled 55.49% to 79.09% of shareholding in Blumont as shown in Annex G; and3.3 The above control of the Accounts and the shareholding was unknown to the other market participants.780 The Defence argued that, as a consequence of this instruction, Professor Aitken’s report was “quite meaningless”. They suggested that the very point of Professor Aitken’s report was to assist the court in arriving at or rejecting the conclusion that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled centrally by the accused persons. Thus, as Professor Aitken was told to assume this as the basis of his report, his entire analytical process was flawed.

781 I rejected this contention. To be clear, I accepted that a market surveillance expert’s report could play a central role in cases like these in ascertaining whether the impugned accounts appeared to have been the subject of centralised control. A high concentration of unusual trading patterns between specific accounts, for example, may reveal something amiss. However, that was not the only way by which centralised control could be established for the purposes of false trading and market rigging charges. Control could be established by other types of evidence and, on that footing, the market surveillance expert’s report could validly render an opinion in respect of whether those controlled accounts had engaged in illicit trading activity. Accordingly, while I agreed with the Defence that Professor Aitken’s evidence was not probative of the issue of control (given his terms of reference), this certainly did not render his report “meaningless” as the Defence suggested.Roll-over contra trading782 The practice of roll-over contra trading is set out at [75]–[76] above. As mentioned there, it was certainly not illegitimate to trade on a contra basis, or, indeed, even to roll-over contra trades. Rather, the illegitimacy of this practice as applied in this case was it being used in an abusive manner, and alongside the illegitimate practices described below, particularly wash trading. As discussed in connection with Issue 1, many TRs for the Local Accounts testified that the accused persons had adopted this practice when they instructed trades in those accounts. On the collective basis of those TRs’ evidence, I accepted that this practice had indeed been adopted and was abusive in the sense that it had been applied consistently and at a scale. Wash trading783 At [74]–[85] above, I described wash trading and set out illustrations as to how it had been used in this case. I do not repeat those here. Instead, I will set out Professor Aitken’s assessment in respect of: (a) the number of days on which wash trading was carried out for BAL shares during the Relevant Period; and (b) the relevant volumes and percentages of wash trades. I will also set out Mr White’s reply and its impact (if any) on my conclusions. 784 Professor Aitken’s evidence was as follows:(a) First, in respect of Blumont shares, from 2 January to 3 October 2013, wash trading took place on 170 of the total 190 trading days during this period. Wash trading also accounted for an average of 17% of the total volume of Blumont shares traded per day.

785 Where Asiasons and LionGold were concerned, it could not be doubted that almost half of the counters’ trades being wash trades was a clear marker of illegitimacy. Although the figures in respect of Blumont were somewhat lower than the other two companies, Professor Aitken opined that such figures were still “very significant and would lead to a false and misleading appearance of active trading”.

 had been carrying out the majority of illicit wash trades between themselves. There were two problems with such an approach: (a) First, although a substantial volume of BAL trades had been carried out between these “rogue” traders, that did not account for the remaining BAL trades executed between the remaining Relevant Accounts. Those remaining trades were not insubstantial by any stretch of the imagination. (b) Second, and more fundamentally, the fact of trades between these groups did not carry much prior analytical value. As I have addressed in my discussion on the question of control above, each of these individuals gave evidence that their trades had been coordinated by the accused persons, be it within their groups or between their groups. Thus, it was the primary evidence that needed to be dealt with. After all, the fact that such a high volume of trades had been carried out between the accounts managed by these individuals was perfectly consistent with the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had been coordinating them on the whole. 788 Accordingly, although the Prosecution and Defence differed in terms of what they viewed as wash trading, that depended on my findings as to the control of the Relevant Accounts. As I largely accepted the Prosecution’s case, there was little dispute between Professor Aitken and Mr White as to the volumes of wash trading which had been carried out between those accounts. Such volumes were substantial as set out at [784] above and the inference to be drawn from this was obvious.Pre-arranged trading789 Related to wash trading, I should add that Professor Aitken also analysed the trade data for prearranged trading. He identified a trade as pre-arranged when: (a) its corresponding bid and ask were entered within 30 seconds of each other; (b) the trade volume was 10,000 shares or more; and (c) the outcome of the trade was that both the bid and ask square off, ie, there was no outstanding volume to be fulfilled.

 Having broadened the criteria, Mr White found 989 pre-arranged trades, as against 97 trades identified by Professor Aitken. Further, Mr White found that 75% of these trades involve those such as Mr Leroy Lau, the Manhattan House Group, and Mr Wong XY who, according to the accused persons, were acting in concert to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. 790 Again, to reiterate, I have found against the accused persons in relation to the control of the Relevant Accounts. Even on Professor Aitken’s analysis, he identified 15 days on which the Relevant Accounts potentially pre-arranged trades for Blumont shares, 16 days in respect of Asiasons, and 12 days in respect of LionGold.

 Although the volumes varied on each of these days, Professor Aitken’s evidence was that a total of 3,388,000 Blumont, 3,203,000 Asiasons, and 3,116,000 LionGold shares were wash traded between the Relevant Accounts by pre-arrangement.

 These instances were sufficient in his view to reach the conclusion that absent a legitimate explanation, such trading activity “points to the trades being conducted for the purpose of creating artificial volume and a false appearance of active trading”.

Constraining the spread791 Professor Aitken also applied an algorithm in his analysis of the BAL trading data which “look[ed] for attempts by the [Relevant] Accounts to hold the price in a range by placing large orders on both sides of the order book”. His explanation as to the impact of such a trading practice as well as how he sought to identify such attempts, was as follows:
                   1859




Foot Note 1859

  MJA-1 at paras 5.10–5.11.



… The impact of the large orders is such that it becomes nearly impossible for the price of the share to move upwards or downwards, unless third parties place very large orders, or the [Relevant] Accounts delete their orders. In effect, the large orders on both sides of the order book constrain the price of the security within a floor and a ceiling price, thus artificially stabilising and restricting the price from moving outside of that band.To identify such behaviour, we identify situations where the [Relevant] Accounts are responsible for more than 50% of the queue on both sides of the order book at the best bid and ask prices. We also look for how sustained this behaviour is by analysing how often during the day this situation persists. In my view, behaviour that persists for more than half of the trading day, absent an explanation, is suspicious and requires an explanation. I set the volume and duration parameters at these high levels in order to reduce the incidence of picking up instances that may have occurred by chance. Setting the algorithm parameters at these levels also of course reduces the incidence of identifying manipulation, which is intended to give the benefit of any doubt to the [Relevant] Accounts.[emphasis added]792 Mr White did not take any objection with Professor Aitken’s definition or methodology in respect of this algorithm. Instead, he referred to certain instances discussed by Professor Aitken as illustrations of actors seeking to constrain the spread of BAL shares, and highlighted that each of those instances concerned buy and sell orders entered by Mr Leroy Lau.

 At the end of this exercise, Mr White then opined: “I am reasonably confident that probably all examples of constraint spread in all three counters in accordance with [Professor Aitken’s algorithm], will be in part due to Leroy’s day trading activity”.

 793 Given my finding that Mr Leroy Lau’s account was an account that had been controlled by the accused persons pursuant to some broader scheme (see [308]–[322] above), this aspect of Mr White’s evidence did not assist the Defence’s case. Thus, it suffices to state the hit-rate of Professor Aitken’s algorithm. In respect of Blumont, he found that there were just 13 trading between 2 January and 3 October 2013 (comprising 190 trading days in total) on which the algorithm was triggered.

… I understood [the First Accused’s (“John”)] overall mandate to be that the share prices cannot fall, but must instead be increasing in a stable manner, ideally over a few months. This would be achieved by rollover trading at gradually increasing prices. A gradual and steadily rising share price makes each counter attractive, the price increase more believable, and ensures that the contra positions taken by the Controlled Accounts would not incur losses. John was generally not concerned about hitting particular price levels.795 Seen in this light, the restricted price movements, was highly logical. By creating difficult-to-break layers on both sides of the order book, Mr Leroy Lau would have been able to give effect to the First Accused’s two-pronged objective of stability and gradual increase in the counters’ prices. A thick floor would have ensured price stability, and a thick ceiling which Mr Leroy Lau could remove when necessary (see [796]–[801] below) would have prevented sharp, attention-grabbing price spikes while still enabling him to facilitate a gradual upward climb.Removing orders while having large orders on both sides of the book796 The next algorithm used by Professor Aitken in his analysis of the BAL trading data sought to identify instances “where the [Relevant] Accounts, while having large orders on both sides of the order book, suddenly remove[d] large orders on one side of the book (by deleting or amending down the volume or by trading out the order using wash trades), thereby allowing the price to rise (by deleting large orders on the sell side) or fall (by deleting large orders on the buy side)”.

The manipulator’s goal here is that the sudden removal of significant orders on only one side of the order book (after creating an initial appearance of an intention to trade by first placing the large order) would convey to the market the impression of a significant change in buying (or selling) interest. For example, the manipulator could remove a large sell order to give the impression of positive price-sensitive information impacting a marketplace, even though no such information in fact exists. This can be expected to induce other investors to react to that supposed positive price-sensitive information, leading them to buy, and causing the price to increase, even though no such information exists. Such behaviour therefore interferes with the free market forces of demand and supply.The placing of an order, especially a large, costly, order, is necessarily a considered decision. The sudden, substantial deletion or reduction of such an order suggests (without an appropriate explanation) that there was no genuine intention to fulfil that order in the first place. In the absence of an explanation, the removal of a large order from one side of the order book, where the price had hitherto been constrained by orders on both sides of the order book, is therefore suspicious.798 For Blumont, Professor Aitken reported that this algorithm had been triggered on nine out of 190 relevant trading days, and, on six of those days, there were no price sensitive announcements.

 I did not think Mr White’s observations were helpful. But even if I were to discount the trades on those days, there were still, respectively, five, ten and more than 40 other days where this illegitimate trading practice was detected by the algorithm in respect of Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold shares. 801 In the round, as there was no significant dispute regarding the utility of this algorithm, or its parameters, I bore in mind the fact that it had been triggered as many times as it did. Moreover, to avoid doubt, I should state that I also accepted Professor Aitken’s evidence that this algorithm being triggered at all (regardless of the number of instances) was suspicious. That said, naturally, the more times the algorithm was triggered, the more weight it carried. Aggressive trading802 Next, Professor Aitken sought to identify instances where a trader or traders caused the price of a share to move up by at least three ticks, within a ten-minute period, without testing the market. I have used the word “tick” at several points above. To elaborate, a price “tick” (also called a “step” or “pip”) was the minimum amount by which a particular share could move. For shares trading at a price below S$2.00, the tick was half a cent, and for those trading above S$2.00, the tick was one cent. As regards the “without testing the market” requirement, Professor Aitken explained that, if a trader was interested in purchasing shares, he would normally “test the market’s interest by leaving a buy order at the best bid price [or lower] for a period of time”. The test trade allowed the trader to determine if there were any sellers willing to fulfil his bid at that “best bid” price or lower. Placing bids at price levels above the best bid would, of course, allow the bid to be fulfilled more quickly. However, Professor Aitken’s evidence was that, absent some information on which the trader was acting on, professional traders usually “tr[ied] to avoid” moving share prices in this way as it would ultimately costs them or their clients more money.

 These three bids were also placed in the IB account of Mr Tan BK, and were all for 100,000 shares, though not all were fully fulfilled.807 Mr Tai did not specifically give evidence in respect of these trades executed in Relevant Accounts under his management. However, it was evident why Professor Aitken identified it as an instance of aggressive trading. While it was not inconceivable that real market participants would have traded in the manner described above, it was extremely unlikely. Even examined superficially, the trades appeared systematically targeted at driving the price of Asiasons shares upwards. In fact, on a more general basis, there was direct evidence from Mr Leroy Lau as to aggressive trading he had carried out for the accused persons in order to cause price hikes. In respect of LionGold, his evidence has been reproduced at [94] in full. Most saliently, he said that “[a] simple way for [him] to move up the price on [his] own was by buying up all the sell orders which had been entered at increasingly higher prices, thus moving up the price of the stock”.

 While I accepted that there may be abstract merit to Mr White’s criticism, it certainly was not a point which carried much weight in this case. If, instead, Mr White had demonstrated that price range of three ticks was too narrow by reference to the price movement of BAL shares outside the Relevant Period, that would have made for a far more apt critique of Professor Aitken’s choice of parameters. 809 Accordingly, as I did not accept this aspect of Mr White’s objection to Professor Aitken’s evidence, I gave due weight to the instances on which this algorithm had been triggered (as set out at [803] above).Uneconomic trading810 Another algorithm deployed by Professor Aitken to identify indicia of market manipulation and price rigging sought to find evidence of uneconomic or loss-making trading. In essence, the algorithm “look[ed] for days [on which] the [Relevant] Accounts were[,] on average[,] selling at prices lower than that at which the[y] were buying. This [was] done by comparing the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the [Relevant] Accounts’ buying and selling activity on each trading day”.

Absent an explanation (e.g. new price sensitive information part way through a trading session), uneconomic trading is frequently associated with trading to create a false and misleading appearance, since trading for profit is generally the objective of market participants. While on the face of it incurring a loss does not seem rational, it can be rational if, as a result of the trading, there are other contracts between the trader and third parties where the gains by the trader or his associates will outweigh the trading losses or where the losses are simply reimbursed to the losing parties at a later point, the purpose often being to create a false impression of volume. However, the fact that a trade is rational does not mean that it is not false and misleading. Indeed, in looking for a rational explanation (such as the trader benefiting from a position in an expiring option contract), that can help one understand why the manipulation occurred in the first place.[cross-references omitted]811 On Professor Aitken’s analysis, this algorithm had been triggered: (a) on 56 trading days as regards Blumont shares, of which 48 days contained no price sensitive announcements;

 Relying on these figures (as with the others resulting from the other algorithms he deployed), Professor Aitken generally opined that manipulation could be inferred unless some other legitimate explanation could be furnished. 812 Mr White’s fundamental objection to Professor Aitken’s vis-à-vis this algorithm was that the latter seemed to have proceeded on the a priori assumption that if this algorithm had been triggered, “it [was] evidence of manipulation”. Mr White did not agree with this approach, as Professor Aitken made no attempt to “study any of the underlying data that triggered [this algorithm]”.

 However, in my view, the most obvious problem with Mr White’s critique was that as a fundamental premise, there could not have been a logical dispute that traders do not enter the stock market with a view to losing money. If the evidence showed that the Relevant Accounts had generally engaged in uneconomic trading, the following questions necessarily arose: (a) whether the accounts had set out to trade in a manner which would naturally cause them to lose money; and (b) whether there was some other explanation for why the Relevant Accounts would have traded in such a manner.813 Neither Professor Aitken nor Mr White’s evidence could answer these two questions. These were questions to be answered by witnesses of fact, and to which I turn when addressing whether the accused persons had an endgame planned for the Scheme. Indeed, the experts could only address the prior query of whether the accounts had been trading uneconomically in the first place. As to this question, Mr White’s central objection to Professor Aitken’s evidence was that “[his] calculations on each day treat[ed] all accounts and groups as one … and ma[d]e no attempt to place the VWAP in context in line with the modus operandi of the constituent Group or Groupings”.

 However, as stated from [778]–[781] above, this was a function of Professor Aitken’s terms of reference and, in any case, given my findings that 187 of the 189 Relevant Accounts had been controlled, this criticism did not hold. Accordingly, when assessing the existence of the Scheme as a whole, I took into account the figures at [811] alongside my analysis of the accused persons endgame for the Scheme, as discussed at [853]–[869] below.Summary of my findings on Issue 3814 In summary, I accepted Professor Aitken’s evidence that the Relevant Accounts had engaged in several illegitimate trading practices throughout the Relevant Period, albeit to differing degrees. When viewed against the backdrop of my findings on control, these practices stood in strong support of an inference that the common purpose for which the Relevant Accounts had been used concerned the market and price manipulation of BAL shares.815 I should also state broadly that I rejected Mr White’s oppositions to Professor Aitken’s evidence. This, in large part, was due to the fact that his terms of reference were simply different from those of Professor Aitken. Professor Aitken’s evidence served to round off the Prosecution’s case, on the basis that they could separately establish control. Mr White sought to show, through his analysis of the trading patterns, that a few key players – namely, the Manhattan House Group, Mr Leroy Lau and Mr Wong XY – had been responsible for most of the illegitimate trading activities seen across all 189 Relevant Accounts. This, in turn, was supposed to support the conclusion that they had been independent actors, who had not executed BAL orders under the directions of the accused persons. However, this was not an effective approach. As my discussion of the issue of control from [194]–[727] would have made obvious, there were many distinct strands of evidence with which called for either or both accused persons’ explanations. A catchall analysis of trading patterns simply could not bear enough probative counterweight to address each and every one of those strands.816 For completeness, I note that Professor Aitken also detected evidence of two other practices which were referred to as “painting the tape or making the close” and “late auction orders”. While Mr White raised certain concerns about specific findings, generally, he accepted Professor Aitken’s methodology for each practice. For two reasons, I saw no need to, and did not, rely on these aspects of Professor Aitken’s evidence. First, the algorithms were not engaged at particularly significant levels. Second, these trading practices did not feature significantly in the witnesses’ testimonies. According, I do not discuss them any further. Issue 4: Were the markets for BAL shares inflated?817 Given my findings that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons to carry out BAL trades, the short answer to this question was a straightforward “yes”. I have set out Professor Aitken’s findings at [87] and [784] above, based on the daily average volumes of wash trades as against daily total trading volumes in all the Relevant Accounts. On Mr White’s evidence, the volume of trades executed only between the Relevant Accounts constituted the following:

(a) First, 18.4% of the total volume of Blumont shares traded during the Relevant period, or 353,066,000 of 1,922,184,000 shares.

 On the footing that the Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons, these were wash trades. In my view, wash trades constituted the most accurate representation of the extent to which the markets for BAL shares could be said to have been artificially inflated. After all, if a trade was a wash, there could have been no suggestion that the trade served any purpose other than the inflation of liquidity. And, given the very high figures of wash trading carried out in the Relevant Accounts, it was clear to me that the markets for BAL shares had been inflated. 819 That said, I should highlight that apart from wash trading volumes between the Relevant Accounts, the Prosecution also tended to rely on the volume of trades the Relevant Accounts carried out, whether they were buying or selling and whether the trade was a wash or not (see, eg, [86] above).

 Naturally, these figures were much higher and the question was thus whether these figures ought to be taken into consideration instead of the wash trading figures when ultimately assessing the existence of the Scheme. 820 As I understood the Prosecution’s position, these figures were properly taken into consideration because, irrespective of whether the trades were washes, BAL trades instructed by the accused persons still had the effect of inflating the liquidity of the market even when shares flowed in and out of the network of Relevant Accounts. Given that the accused persons funded the Scheme by abusing contra trades and by obtaining margin financing in many of the Relevant Accounts, there seemed to me to be no need for them to preserve a perfect system of wash trades. It was tolerable for BAL shares to flow in from and out to other market participants because, irrespective of whether the trade had been executed against another Relevant Account or a genuine market participant, transaction costs would be incurred all the same. For this reason, I broadly agreed that the total trading volumes of the Relevant Accounts did somewhat represent the global degree of inflation. However, I should add that this figure was properly considered alongside the wash trading volumes for a more complete picture of both the extent and nature of such inflation.821 Moreover, two clarifications need to be made as to the precise extent to which it could be said that accused persons had been responsible for the global inflation in liquidity created by the Relevant Accounts, or the wash trades executed between the Relevant Accounts.822 First, as I explained from [180]–[190] above, there was some uncertainty as to whether each and every BAL trade executed in the Relevant Accounts could be attributed to the accused persons. Indeed, though I found the accused persons had been in control of the accounts, it was not the Prosecution’s case that they had exercised exclusive control over each account – meaning that, even if the accountholders wanted to place an order for shares in their own accounts, the accused persons could and would preclude them from doing so, such that it could be surmised that, so long as a BAL trade had been placed in the accounts, it had been under the hand of the accused persons. I therefore made no such finding. Thus, it could not be said, on the basis that the accused persons had “controlled” the Relevant accounts, that they ipso facto had also been responsible for every BAL trade executed therein. That was simply not an automatic conclusion to which my findings of “control” led. That said, the distinction between control and exclusive control was largely irrelevant as a matter of fact. Numerous TRs gave evidence that they had only received trading instructions from the accused persons and not the Relevant Accountholders throughout the Relevant Period. Accountholders such as Mr Chen and Mr Goh HC also testified that it was only the accused persons who used their accounts. In respect of these accounts, although the distinction between control and exclusive control still existed, it was simply irrelevant based on the evidence placed before me, and the facts I found thereon.823  In any case, as also suggested at [189] above, that there was some imprecision about the exact BAL trading volumes attributable to the accused persons was not a matter which bore on the accused persons’ liability for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges which were, after all, charges for criminal conspiracy. The fact of the accused persons’ control (even if not exclusive control) over 187 out of the 189 Relevant Accounts was a strong indicium of the Scheme and, although proof of absolute control would have increased the strength of this indication, that was not strictly necessary. Ultimately, the conspiracies and the accused persons’ states of mind need to be inferred in toto, and, the specific volume of trades attributable to the accused persons was more a matter that affected sentencing (see [1307] below).824 Second, I have found that Ms Cheng’s two personal accounts with CIMB (see [420]–[427] above) and Credit Suisse (see [600]–[616] above) had not been controlled by the accused persons. Therefore, any volume of BAL trades executed therein should not be attributed to them. However, in the scale of things, the volumes were not significant. In respect of Ms Cheng’s account with CIMB, a total of 770,000 Blumont shares,

 825 In sum, it was evident from both Professor Aitken and Mr White’s evidence that if the accused persons had controlled the Relevant Accounts which I found, by and large, to be the case, the markets for BAL shares were substantially inflated. This stood in strong support of the inference that there existed a general scheme to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares. Issue 5: Were the prices of BAL shares inflated?826 As mentioned at [6] above, apart from Professor Aitken, the Prosecution also called one Mr Ellison to give evidence on what was the fair market value of BAL shares. The purpose of his evidence was to support the Prosecution’s case in respect of the Price Manipulation Charges. Thus, if BAL shares were “massively overvalu[ed]”, the Prosecution submitted that the “only possible inference” to be drawn from this fact was that there had been manipulation of the prices of those counters by the accused persons.

 Mr Ellison’s methodology and valuation evidence827 Based on their closing prices on 1 October 2013 (the valuation date for the purposes of Mr Ellison’s report), just three trading days before the Crash, Mr Ellison assessed the listed prices of BAL shares to be 30.1, 15.1 and 4.6 times their respective “implied share prices”. To be clear, Mr Ellison’s usage of the phrase “implied share price” was based on his estimation of the fair market value of BAL’s equity. This fair market value was then divided by each of the three company’s shares outstanding to derive their respective implied share values.828 The following table summarises these estimations:

Fair market value is a standard of value which can be understood in terms of a hypothetical market for the asset or business being valued. The standard hypothesises, in effect, a well-attended auction in which the parties are willing but not anxious participants, and are properly informed as to the relevant characteristics of the asset or business in question; and asks, in effect: at what price would the asset or business be expected to change hands?A number of definitions of fair market value exist. The International Valuation Standards (“IVS”) provide the following definition of fair market value for US tax purposes:“the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts”.[footnote omitted]830 As Mr Ellison observed that all three companies had several operating businesses,

The [SOTP] method is typically used to value a subject company with several different operating businesses. …The reason for this is because the different business segments will often have different financial prospects and economic characteristics. By valuing the entire company as a whole, one would “risk missing critical trends and consequently distorting the valuation”.SOTP valuation involves valuing subsidiaries or segments individually using [several] valuation approaches[,] [namely, comparative approaches, income approaches, and asset-based approaches]. Different valuation approaches may be used to value different operating businesses, depending on the nature of those businesses and the availability of information.The value of the individual businesses is summed to estimate the total value of the company’s operations. To arrive at an equity value, the total value of the operating businesses is then adjusted by: adding the value of the non-operating assets held by the company; and deducting the value of the company’s debt.…831 I illustrate with Mr Ellison’s valuation of Blumont. To arrive at an estimation of its “fair market value”, Mr Ellison referred to its annual report for the year 2012,

 wherein Blumont divided its financial results into three operating segments: (a) investments holdings; (b) property; and (c) sterilisation services.832 In respect of its investment holdings, Mr Ellison took the view that an asset-based approach was most appropriate.

 On this footing, he commenced his analysis with Blumont’s financial statements as at 30 June 2013, which reported that it held S$113.8 million in investments. He then added to this figure the fair value of five investments in mineral and energy resource companies made by Blumont after that statement, up until the valuation date (ie, 1 October 2013). The value of these investments was calculated using the quoted prices of those companies’ shares, and Mr Ellison accordingly added S$36.4 million to Blumont’s reported S$113.8 million in investments.

 Lastly, as to the sterilisation segment of Blumont’s business, Mr Ellison applied a comparative approach.

Using those comparable companies, Mr Ellison derived an estimated fair market value of S$8 million.

 There were, of course, substantive analytical differences in Mr Ellison’s approaches towards operating segments falling within different industries.

The First Accused pressed – with some force – the argument that it was simply not possible to ascertain “fair market value” without using the quoted price of the company in question.

 Although I appreciated the free-market argument the First Accused was attempting to make, I did not think it was a sensible line of attack against Mr Ellison’s evidence. The very questions of whether the markets for BAL shares were truly free, and whether genuine market actors were indeed paying “fair market value” if they traded at the quoted prices were at the heart of this case. Therefore, I found Mr Ellison’s response to this fundamental objection to his approach, as set out below, acceptable:

Question (Mr Sreenivasan): So to be very clear, when you are doing this valuation, [fair market value] excluding the quoted price, what exactly are you looking at? You’ve also used the words “intrinsic value”.Answer (Mr Ellison): Well, the fundamentals of the business, the intrinsic value rather than the extrinsic value, ignoring the quoted price and leaving that out of the calculation, so one can see whether the intrinsic value supports the quoted price or not.835 Apart from this fundamental issue as to the very meaning of “fair market value”, the Defence also raised other specific methodological objections to Mr Ellison’s valuation, and highlighted omissions on Mr Ellison’s part to take into consideration important, but less obvious intangible factors which affected the values of BAL, particularly LionGold. Indeed, I should state that the Defence’s central objection, was to Mr Ellison’s valuation of LionGold. Although the Defence also sought to justify the value of Blumont and Asiasons, such justifications were furnished by reference to LionGold. As regards Blumont, it was argued that Blumont’s Chairman, Mr Neo, “had become a believer in the LionGold … model – he decided to transform Blumont into [a mineral, oil and gas] company and invited the [First Accused] to lead the transformation. … since Blumont followed LionGold’s … model, investors were therefore understandably optimistic about Blumont’s future value”.

(b) The second angle was that the ostensibly comparable companies selected by Mr Ellison to estimate the value of LionGold’s gold mining operating segment, were not at all comparable. Rather they were “complete duds”. In this respect, the First Accused gave evidence that each of the “comparable” companies selected by Mr Ellison was essentially worthless or insolvent and, therefore, should not have been compared to LionGold simply because LionGold was loss-making. This failed to appreciate that essentially every mining company that only owns mines in the exploration or development stages would not have revenue.

 My findings on whether BAL shares were overvalued837 To begin, it is apposite to make an observation about the utility of Mr Ellison’s evidence in so far as the accused persons’ liability for the Price Manipulation Charges was concerned. 838 It bears reminding that the Price Manipulation Charges were fairly specific. First, Charge 3 alleged that the accused persons had conspired to cause certain acts to be done, in order to support the price of Blumont shares between 2 and 3 October 2013. Second, by Charge 6, it was alleged that the accused persons had conspired to engage in a course of conduct, to the end of manipulating the price of Asiasons shares in September 2013. Third, Charge 7 was essentially the same as Charge 3 save that it concerned supporting the price of Asiasons shares between 1 and 3 October 2013. Lastly, Charge 10 was essentially the same as Charge 6, save that it concerned manipulating the price of LionGold’s shares in both August as well as September 2013.839 I accepted, of course, that if Mr Ellison was right, and BAL shares were substantially overvalued as at 1 October 2013, that would have been consistent with the overall case advanced by the Prosecution. However, that it would have been consistent with the Prosecution’s case does not mean that it lent much prior analytical value thereto. It will be remembered from [161]–[179] above that the elements of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges placed substantial emphasis on inferences to be drawn about the accused persons’ intentions when carrying out their alleged acts or engaging in their alleged courses of conduct. This was not only because the accused persons had been charged with being participants to criminal conspiracies; the offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA was, itself, also intention-focused (though, admittedly, this was largely confined to the second limb: see [166] above). This being the character of the offences, the accused persons’ liability for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges turned heavily on inferences which could be drawn from the objective or established facts.840 The fact of BAL shares being overvalued could have supported a general inference that the accused persons intended to manipulate the price of Asiasons and LionGold, and to support the price of Blumont and Asiasons. However, at the very highest, it only supported an unspecific inference that was largely unhelpful in this case. After all, the Defence did not even dispute that the markets for and prices of BAL shares had been manipulated; their position was that it had been manipulated by other persons.

 Thus, far more stood to be gleaned from evidence which directly revealed the accused persons’ conduct and potential state of mind. Accordingly, the valuation evidence carried little to no probative weight in so far as the accused persons’ liability for the Price Manipulation Charges was concerned.841 That said, I broadly accepted Mr Ellison’s evidence that the BAL shares were overvalued on 1 October 2013. Mr Ellison’s evidence was not challenged by a corresponding Defence expert on valuation and the evidence given by the First Accused as regards the values of BAL generally (but, more particularly, in respect of LionGold) could not stand as useful opposing opinion evidence to undermine that of Mr Ellison.842 I was mindful that s 47(2) of the Evidence Act permitted experts without particular academic or professional qualifications in the relevant field. Experts could obtain experience through “training, study or experience” [emphasis added]. Section 47(2), which expanded the definition of an “expert”, was enacted by the Evidence (Amendment) Act 2012 and this change essentially reflected the court’s then ongoing “laxity as to who qualifie[d] as an expert” (Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2017] 1 SLR 257 at [63], citing Leong Wing Kong v Public Prosecutor [1994] 1 SLR(R) 681 at [16]). Indeed, it was held as early as Public Prosecutor v Muhamed Bin Sulaiman [1982] 2 MLJ 320 that the qualifications of the expert (or lack thereof) were matters which only went towards weight, not admissibility. 843 In so far as the First Accused’s qualifications were concerned, his counsel stated that “he ran LionGold … [h]e knows a lot more about this than [Mr] Ellison will ever know”.

 I took the point, though I should note that it seemed to undercut the First Accused’s position where the Company Management Charge for LionGold was concerned (see [152] above). This, however, did not substantially assist the First Accused. In this regard, the Prosecution rightly submitted that where opinion evidence was concerned, the independence of the opinion-giver was of high importance.

 The First Accused faced the Price Manipulation Charges to which Mr Ellison’s evidence was said to relate. Naturally, one expected that he would challenge such evidence in a manner that was favourable to his position. Therefore, the first two angles of attack (as set out at [836(a)] and [836(b)] above) carried no real weight in their opposition to Mr Ellison’s evidence.844 This is not to say that the First Accused’s cross-examination of Mr Ellison could not have the effect of undermining the soundness of his methodology or even his final conclusions. They could. However, in my view, they did not manage to do so in the round. Admittedly, I had some doubts about Mr Ellison’s decision to both exclude high outliers and apply the median trading multiple (see [836(c)] above). The Prosecution, citing Mr Ellison’s explanation that it was “better to exclude [outliers] altogether” before deriving the median,

 I rejected this. While it was not illogical, it was certainly not “entirely logical”. 845 The very reason one applies the median over the mean in data sets with large variance is because the median does not have regard to the values in the set per se, but merely their rank within the set. This, in and of itself, serves to minimise distortion. Not only was Mr Ellison’s approach conceptually odd, it arguably decreased the likelihood with which the multiple he applied represented a “fair centre” of the multiples derived from his list of comparable companies. It must not be forgotten that valuation by comparison is, at its core, an abstract exercise. No two companies are truly alike, so multiple comparators are used to average-out the errors which stem from imperfect comparisons, abnormal highs, and dismal lows, so as to arrive at the fairest and most likely representation of the instant company’s value. The greater the number of properly-comparable companies one uses in this exercise, the fairer the abstract representation. Of course, there are practical limitations. There exists only a finite number of companies in the world and few of them will be meaningfully comparable. However, that is precisely why Mr Ellison’s method was probably less right than wrong. Having decided that the data points in his set of comparable companies contained too much variance and, thus, that it was more appropriate to use the median to obtain a fairest multiple, the further exclusion of outliers unnecessarily reduced the representative quality of the set as a whole. Given that median figures are already primed to avoid the distortion caused by outliers, it was self-defeating to exclude data points from a limited set, thereby rendering the set smaller and less arguably representative.846 I therefore generally agreed with Mr Sreenivasan that when one prefers to use the median to avoid distortion and obtain a more representative average figure, there is no need to also exclude outliers.

847 That said, I did not think that this mattered in any material measure. In respect of comparable exploration-stage mining companies, the median trading multiple derived by Mr Ellison was 22.72 with outliers excluded and, with outliers kept in, it was 24.99.

Substituting the trading multiples he applied with those derived without the exclusion of outliers, LionGold’s mining segment would have instead been valued at S$266.13 million.

LionGold also had a listed subsidiary in respect of which Mr Ellison did not apply a comparative approach but, rather, simply used that company’s quoted value of S$29.5 million as at 1 October 2013: see JE-1 at p 67, Table 6.5 and para 6.34. As regards LionGold’s unlisted subsidiaries, the higher trading multiples would have resulted in the following. First, its exploration properties would have been valued at S$18.49 million (rounded to two decimal places) instead of S$16.77 million. Second, its development properties would have been valued at S$105.21 million (rounded to two decimal places) instead of S$17.85 million. Third, its production properties would have been valued at S$112.93 million (rounded to two decimal places) instead of S$74.36 million.



 Adding this to the value of its other operating segments, assets, and subtracting debts and reductions for non-controlling interests, the fair market value of LionGold would have been S$440.83 million instead of Mr Ellison’s estimated S$313.1 million. The quoted value of LionGold as at 1 October 2013 ($1.453 billion) would still have been 329.61% (rounded to two decimal places) of this sum. Although this is lower than the 464% derived by Mr Ellison (see [828] above), it is by no means low.849 This is why I stated at [841] above that I broadly accepted Mr Ellison’s conclusion that Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold were each overvalued as at 1 October 2013. Even the most salient concern I had about Mr Ellison’s methodology did not quite take the accused persons to the conclusion that their values were commensurate with the prices at which they were trading on the Mainboard on 1 October 2013. Nevertheless, it is useful to restate that I did not find this conclusion particularly useful for determining the accused persons’ liability for the Price Manipulation Charges. Thus, though I kept this finding in mind when assessing whether those four charges had been made out, it only had generally confirmatory value.Issue 6: Did the accused persons have a broader plan for their Scheme?850 I turn to the sixth issue set out at [192(f)] above relating to whether the accused persons had a broader plan for their alleged Scheme beyond the mere fact of market manipulation for its own sake. In this connection, the Prosecution pointed to three main strands of evidence: (a) that which showed the First Accused involvement in the management of BAL; (b) that which showed the accused persons monetising BAL shares; and (c) that which directly showed that there was such a plan. Naturally, such a plan, if it had existed, would have lent support to the inference that the accused persons had conspired as generally alleged by the Prosecution. The First Accused’s involvement in the management of BAL851 As stated at [4(d)] above, beyond the Conspiracy Charges, the First Accused faced three charges for being involved in the management of BAL despite being an undischarged bankrupt. I convicted the First Accused of all three charges and found that the extent of his involvement in all three companies was extensive, particularly in connection with the deal-making activities he undertook (see [1158]–[1196] below). Although those charges were wholly separate from the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges under present consideration, the fact of such involvement was significant. 852 On the Prosecution’s case, the First Accused’s involvement in the management of BAL was a crucial component as well as indicium of the accused persons’ broader plan. It was this involvement that enabled them to coordinate their manipulative trading activities with actual corporate activities of the three companies. More specifically, it enabled the accused persons to use the inflated BAL shares as “currency” for corporate deals carried out by BAL. As I found that the First Accused was heavily involved in the management of BAL, that supported the conclusion that such a broader plan actually existed. The endgame planned for the Scheme853 To begin, the First Accused obviously denied that there was any broader “plan” to use the inflated BAL shares as “currency” to make corporate acquisitions. This followed from the accused persons’ more general denial that there was even a scheme to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. However, beyond his denial, the First Accused emphasised that the Prosecution had neither established such a “plan”, nor had they put it to him in cross-examination.

 However, it was not, in my view, necessary for the Prosecution to have done so. As I will explain below, the evidence adduced by the Prosecution during its case was certainly enough to put the point into issue. Further, I also did not think the Prosecution’s failure to put this point to the First Accused was detrimental to the conduct of his defence. As stated, the case advanced by the Defence was that the accused persons simply had not entered into conspiracies to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. Put simply, they denied the charges wholly. Thus, the only internally consistent position the First Accused could have taken was that he had no intention to use BAL shares as “currency” to carry out corporate acquisitions. He may have been able to respond to the allegations against him with greater precision, but that was a matter which he could equally and, in fact, he did, deal with in submissions. 855 As to whether the Prosecution managed to establish its allegation, it relied on the following pieces of evidence:

Dov, I decided to write down some of what we spoke about yesterday to try and flesh out ideas. I am obviously watching Blumont and Liongold very carefully (I hope we are not peaking too early on that one!!!) and can’t help but get excited about the possibility of turning Asiasons into global energy giant. The opportunity to use a strong vibrant liquid equity as currency for acquisitions is a powerful thought. I think our two staged approach is the correct one in which we establish 30 percent position for Asiasons for 150 million US. I would potentially consider broader idea for egm stage including handing over balance of Black Elk- if I better understood the fundamentals relating to Asiasons.1-What is currently in Asiasons? Does the company make money from operating the dragon funds? Is that asset of the company? Is the ownership of liongold and high five in Asiasons or in their funds? It would obviously be helpful from our standpoint if Asiasons was not just 900 million shell but at least had some core value to it.2-Does John strongly influence decision making? That is to say, if the stock rallied to 1.50 and we brought strong acquisition opportunity that we thoroughly vetted and John agreed, would he be able to push it through? What would the decision making at the company be?3-What is the current makeup of ownership of the company? Are there insider shares, that if free, could quickly negatively impact shareholder value?In short, upon seeing the success of Blumont and Liongold, I would have to think seriously about perhaps taking a greater leap of faith. I feel in my bones there will be acquisition opportunities (particularly US Gas) that could transform asiasons to oil and gas giant, one that rivals global leaders. I also know that John and I are like minded on what accretive acquisitions will be. I would just want to make sure the environment within the company would allow us to take advantage of the excitement I believe Asiasons can generate in the marketplace. Anyhow, let’s get together now that you are back, it’s been too long! Regards, Mark[emphasis added]For completeness, Mr Nordlicht’s email was addressed to an individual bearing the name “Dov Wiener”. On the First Accused’s evidence, he was a staff from a firm called “Jett Capital” which was involved in the potential acquisition of Black Elk as a “deal broker”.

 In my view, while this email hinted at what the First Accused may have had in mind, it was quite equivocal given that the First Accused was not a party to the substantive exchange, but merely a recipient of a forwarded copy. Indeed, the suggestion that either Blumont, Asiasons or LionGold shares be used as currency came from Mr Nordlicht and there was no evidence that the First Accused had somehow initiated this train of thought, nor was there evidence that he had responded. 858 Next, I turn to Mr Ellison’s evidence, which I similarly found unhelpful to answer the question of what the endgame of the Scheme was, or, at least, might have been. This was a question of the First Accused’s motives and intentions during the Relevant Period. Therefore, whether or not BAL shares were overvalued shed little light on this point. The fact of overvaluation could, at best, support the inference that the accused persons were acting to push the price of BAL shares up. To have taken Mr Ellison’s evidence that the BAL shares were overvalued as supporting the matter being considered here would have been to make his conclusion carry more weight than it could have borne. Pushing the price of a share up has a variety of different possible benefits and the fact of a higher price itself did not suggest a motive or intention to use the artificially valuable shares. 859 At any rate, I did not need to rely on these tangential pieces of evidence to reach the conclusion that the First Accused had the endgame in mind. As will be explained momentarily, I reviewed the testimonies of Mr Tai, Mr Leroy Lau, as well as Mr Nicholas Ng, and I accepted their direct accounts of the First Accused explaining to them his intention to use Asiasons and LionGold shares to execute cash swaps and corporate acquisitions. Mr Leroy Lau and Mr Nicholas Ng also spoke about the accused persons’ plan for Blumont, albeit in somewhat more general terms. 860 With that in mind, I turn to the relevant testimonies. First, Mr Tai’s evidence concerned Asiasons shares and related to the Black Elk acquisition referenced in Mr Nordlicht’s email, as reproduced at [856] above. The critical portions of Mr Tai’s evidence are set out at [97]–[99] above in full. In brief, Mr Tai testified the First Accused planned for Asiasons to acquire Black Elk through a share swap, and, to ensure that the share swap would go through, the price of Asiasons had to be pushed down on 12 September 2013. The First Accused also said that once the deal had been announced, Asiasons’ share price would go back up. On 12 September 2013, the First Accused gave instructions to Mr Tai on trades so as to push down Asiasons’ share price. 861 It should be noted that the Black Elk deal did not ultimately go through given the Crash which took place less than a month after the incident which Mr Tai described. However, this did not affect my analysis as the deal had been announced. On Mr Tai’s evidence, after the efforts to press down the price of Asiasons shares, a trading halt was called from 13 to 16 September 2013. Upon the resumption of trading on 17 September 2013, Asiasons announced the Black Elk deal.

 The total consideration provided by Asiasons for the deal was approximately US$171.7 million payable in the form 94,642,712 new, ordinary Asiasons shares to be issued. Thereafter, true to what Mr Tai testified he had been told by the First Accused, the share price of Asiasons went up. In fact, for 17 to 18 September 2013, Mr Tai took instructions from Mr Gan (who was coordinating the daily market roll of Asiasons at the material time) to push up Asiasons’ share price.

862 Apart from attacking Mr Tai’s credibility more generally (a point which I have addressed from [688]–[694] above), the First Accused did not seem to have a substantial response to this specific allegation. 863 It was submitted that Mr Tai’s evidence was inconsistent with the fact that Mr Gan was the individual allegedly appointed by the accused persons to coordinate the “market operations” during this period. If so, it was argued by the First Accused that “the [First Accused] should have instructed [Mr Gan] instead, not [Mr Tai]”. On this footing, the First Accused also asserted that the Prosecution had “studiously or wilfully” ignored the inconsistent testimonies of its witnesses.

 This argument simply did not follow. The fact that Mr Gan had been tasked with running “market operations” for Asiasons did not mean that the First Accused could not instruct another key actor in the Scheme to perform a vital function in ensuring the Black Elk deal went through. Indeed, even if the First Accused had first instructed Mr Gan, it was likely that Mr Gan would have tapped on Mr Tai, who had at his disposal all the Relevant Accounts held with IB and Saxo. Dumping some of the shares held in these accounts, which Mr Tai could do with several clicks, was an efficient way to apply downward pressure on the price of Asiasons shares.864 Further, Mr Tai’s evidence in respect of Asiasons did not stand alone. It was supported in clear terms by the evidence given by Mr Leroy Lau generally as regards of BAL shares and, more particularly, in respect of LionGold shares. It should be evident from [308]–[322] above that Mr Leroy Lau’s role in the accused persons’ Scheme was unique. However, quite apart from his individual ability as a skilled day-trader and the substantial daily limit DMG & Partners made available to him, Mr Leroy Lau seemed to have earned the trust of the accused persons, particularly the First Accused. He could thus give evidence as to the accused persons’ overall objective for the Scheme,

… Broadly, [the First Accused (“John”)] wanted BAL shares to be perceived favourably by the market. As such, John wanted the three counters, BAL, to achieve the following objectives:(a) Firstly, John wanted the shares to be liquid. John and [the Second Accused (“Su-Ling”)] achieved liquidity by churning the trading volume in each of the three counters through rollover trading in the [Relevant] Accounts, which would maintain liquidity, and hence interest, in the counters.(b) Secondly, I understood John’s overall mandate to be that the share prices cannot fall, but must instead be increasing in a stable manner, ideally over a few months. This would be achieved by rollover trading at gradually increasing prices. A gradual and steadily rising share price makes each counter attractive, the price increase more believable, and ensures that the contra positions taken by the [Relevant] Accounts would not incur losses. John was generally not concerned about hitting particular price levels. There were however exceptional situations when John would want to push up the share prices aggressively. This was usually when the company in question was about to make, or had just made, a positive announcement.Achieving these trading objectives for BAL shares enabled John to: (a) Use the shares as currency, by pledging the shares to [Financial Institutions (“FIs”)] as collateral to borrow cash or to get more trading lines through his proxies’ trading accounts – this would give him the trading limits he needed in order to carry out manipulative trades. John taught me that liquidity is a fundamental criteri[on] which FIs would assess before accepting a certain share as collateral, and the share must be liquid at least for the preceding three to six months. Even after credit is granted, maintaining liquidity was still important to ensure that that the FIs do not reduce or withdraw the credit line subsequently. Ensuring that the share prices did not fall would prevent FIs from making margin calls on the credit extended. I observed that FIs were more likely to grant a higher limit if a diversified portfolio of shares was offered as collateral as the FIs would perceive there to be less risk when lending – I believe it was for this reason that John arranged for his proxies to pledge all three counters together to FIs, since BAL had unrelated and diverse businesses. John also explained to me that liquidity was important to the shareholders of the target companies which were being acquired through share swaps, as it meant that these shareholders would be able to trade their BAL shares more easily.(b) Use the shares as deal consideration when acquiring asset-rich companies.(c) Attract genuine market participants to trade in BAL.(d) Grow the market capitalisation of BAL. Market capitalisation is a function of price and number of issued shares – a gradually rising share price, coupled with the issuance of new shares (in placements of BAL shares to friendly parties and as payment for acquisitions), means a growing market capitalisation. This was important to John because he said that a bigger market capitalisation would allow BAL to join indexes (e.g. [Financial Times Stock Exchange] mid-cap), which would enhance the visibility of BAL, and attract more investors to trade in BAL. John said that a bigger market capitalisation is a key criteria for larger investment banks in determining whether to accept BAL shares as collateral (thus increasing his trading limits), and would make BAL shares attractive to the shareholders of the target companies, and make it easier for the target companies’ board to justify a positive recommendation to accept the acquisition offer.[cross-references omitted]866 Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence was particularly damning. It revealed an intricate and elaborate plan to not only artificially inflate the liquidity and prices of BAL shares, but was additionally capped off with techniques by which the First Accused had intended to, essentially, give post hoc legitimacy to the inflated markets and prices for the shares. Had this plan been completely executed, there was a chance that the Scheme would not only have eluded discovery, it would have been relieved of the markers which would have triggered an investigation in the first place.867 Mr Nicholas Ng’s evidence corroborated that of Mr Leroy Lau as well as that of Mr Tai. Before I set out his evidence, I should repeat that the Prosecution applied to impeach Mr Nicholas Ng’s credit based on 12 areas of inconsistency between the statements he had given to the CAD and the evidence he gave in court. One alleged area of inconsistency pertained to the present issue. As stated, the Prosecution’s application was for the most part unnecessary, and I ultimately did not find his credit to have been impeached (see [584]–[587] above). In respect of ten of these 12 areas, when confronted with his positions in the statements, Mr Nicholas Ng either fully or partially adopted the evidence he had given to the CAD. 868 This was the case for his evidence on the present issue. In his statements, it was Mr Nicholas Ng’s evidence that the First Accused intended to increase the traded volumes and share prices of BAL shares, in order to increase the market capitalisation of the three companies, so that the shares of these companies could be used to pay for acquisitions.

 This corroborated Mr Leroy Lau’s account, and although Mr Nicholas Ng still reneged on his position vis-à-vis Blumont and Asiasons, I was satisfied from the evidence of Mr Tai, that there was also such a plan in respect of Asiasons. As regards Blumont, I refer to the corporate acquisition made by Blumont, discussed at [1175] below. That Blumont shares had been used as “currency” in that instance somewhat supported the conclusion that there also existed a similar plan in respect of Blumont. 869 In my judgment, the totality of the evidence supported the inference that the accused persons had a broad plan to use the Scheme as a means to increase the attractiveness of BAL shares as “currency” for the purposes of carrying out corporate acquisitions. This inference was slightly weaker where Blumont was concerned, and I kept that in mind when arriving at my final conclusions on whether the relevant False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges had been made out.The monetisation of BAL shares870 Somewhat connected to the accused persons’ broader “plan” as just discussed above, the Prosecution made detailed submissions as to certain techniques deployed by the accused persons in order to monetise BAL shares.

Trading in Blumont shares and further confirmation of [the First Accused’s (“JS”)] and [the Second Accused’s (“QSL”)] plan to monetise their sharesAs I mentioned earlier, I suspected that JS’ and QSL’s ultimate aim was to monetise existing LionGold and Asiasons shares they controlled. My suspicions were confirmed sometime in March 2013, when JS used the IB accounts to lock up large blocks of Blumont shares. Prior to March 2013, JS and QSL occasionally used the Saxo and IB accounts to acquire small amounts of Blumont shares (formerly called Adroit). However, most of the margin limit in the accounts was still used for locking up and rolling LionGold and Asiasons shares. This changed in March 2013, when JS arranged for large sums of money to be transferred to the four main IB accounts (i.e. the accounts of [Mr Chen], [Mr Tan BK], QSL and [Mr Neo]) as collateral, and used the resulting margin limit to lock up a large block of Blumont shares. I found out subsequently that the sums provided as collateral were proceeds of Blumont shares that JS had monetised. Let me explain more below.I found out around this time from JS that he had a lot of Blumont shares which were “free-of-payment” or FOP (i.e. shares which have been fully paid up for), which he kept in proxy share financing accounts at United Overseas Bank (“UOB”).JS explained to me that he kept his shares with UOB because UOB offered arrangements where he could receive payment for any shares he sold in the market on the next working day. JS was able to utilise the arrangement with UOB as a means of obtaining quick cash which he partly used as collateral to obtain more financing from his other proxy margin accounts to lock up the FOP shares he just sold in the market, while obtaining additional cash in the process without losing control of his FOP shares.Let me illustrate this with the following hypothetical example:(a) JS controls a large block of Blumont shares which are FOP, and kept in proxy share financing accounts with UOB. He wants to monetise S$2m worth of shares without losing control of those shares. To do that, JS has to use the margin facilities from his other proxy accounts to buy over these shares to lock up. This means that JS first has to arrange for these other proxy accounts to be collateralised in order to have the necessary margin limit.(b) IB offers margin financing for Blumont shares at a gearing ratio of 1:2. This means that JS will need to inject S$1m cash into his proxy accounts with IB to obtain enough margin limit to buy S$2m of shares from his proxy accounts with UOB.(c) On Monday, JS arranges for the S$2m of shares from his UOB proxy accounts to be sold on the open market, and buys these shares on contra using his other proxy accounts with local brokerages. This means that the proxy accounts with the local brokerages have T+5 days (i.e. until next Monday) to sell the shares or pay S$2m for them.(d) On Tuesday, JS will receive S$2m cash from UOB as proceeds from the sale of his FOP shares. JS will then pump S$1m of this cash into his proxy accounts with IB as collateral.(e) On Wednesday, after the collateral has been processed, JS will be able to use his proxy accounts with IB to take over the S$2m worth of Blumont shares that were purchased on contra using the proxy accounts of the local brokerages.The result of the above exercise is that JS has managed to sell S$2m of FOP Blumont shares in UOB under his control, and lock them up using IB’s margin financing facilities (thereby retaining control over those shares), while at the same time extracting S$1m in cash from the sale of the additional FOP shares for his own use. This was how JS was able to raise the collateral to lock up large blocks of Blumont shares in the IB accounts in March 2013, and at the same time extract cash from the system.JS described this method of monetising the value of his shares as “pa chu pa jip”, which was Hokkien for “hit out, hit in”. This meant that JS monetised his shares by throwing them out into the open market, and then locking them up using the other margin accounts he controlled, and in the process obtain cash that he could then use. Effectively, all the money that JS extracted from this process was ultimately provided by the brokerage or financial institution offering the margin facilities.872 Mr Leroy Lau gave a slightly less detailed but substantially similar account of how the First Accused had taught him how to monetise FOP shares.

 Similarly, matching work carried out by the Prosecution supported the conclusion that the First Accused had coordinated the sale of these 10,000,000 to other Relevant Accounts. Indeed, the Prosecution’s matching exercise suggested that 8,920,000 of the 10,000,000 Blumont shares sold from Mr Wong XY and Mr Wong TS’s UOB share margin financing account went to Relevant Accounts. These were Mr Leroy Lau’s, as well as Mr Chiew, Mr Soh KC, Mr Soh HY, and Mr Fernandez’s accounts with AmFraser under the management of Mr Wong XY.

 Notwithstanding the slight gap in respect of the Second Accused’s UOB account, the fact that such cashier’s orders were taken out was consistent with the First Accused’s messages to Ms Cheng that the funds required from this monetisation exercise were required for a deal (see [874(a)] above), Rodyk being the solicitors of the counterparty to whom consideration was being paid.876 This elaborate series of transactions was put to the First Accused during cross-examination and he made two vital concessions. The first was that the exercise he had described to Ms Cheng was, in fact, a method for monetising shares.

 878 I appreciated that, if Ms Tracy Ooi’s account was taken as true, that stood in relatively strong support of the First Accused’s position. However, I was hesitant to accept it as such. Obviously, her position could not be tested. This was, of course, no fault of the First Accused and it was simply a matter of circumstance. However, unfortunate as it was for his case, without her to attest to the truth of her statement and to provide a fuller account of how the objective evidence adduced by the Prosecution squared with her account, there was not enough for me to construe her bare statement as vindicating the First Accused’s defence. Indeed, I was also doubtful because Ms Tracy Ooi’s statement did not sit comfortably with the objective evidence adduced by the Prosecution, particularly, the First Accused’s messages to Ms Cheng and the coincidence of calls and BAL orders entered in the Relevant Accounts described above.

 The First Accused’s assertion that the monetisation exercise had been carried out for Mr Neo’s personal benefit was also bare and did not cut any ice. 879 In the round, the weight of the evidence strongly favoured the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had managed to monetise BAL shares using their control of the Relevant Accounts. Chiefly, this exercise was driven by the First Accused, though it must be remembered that some LionGold shares had been sold from the Second Accused’s UOB share margin financing account (see [874(b)] above). The Second Accused was thus also involved. In carrying out this exercise, the accused persons were able to exploit their control of the Relevant Accounts to extract funds from FIs. The evidence showed that such funds had been put towards corporate deals being contemplated by BAL and, thus, the accused persons’ ability to monetise BAL shares in this manner contributed to the broader “plan” underpinning their Scheme as discussed from [853]–[869] above.Summary of my findings on Issue 6880 In sum, the oral evidence of witnesses as well as the objective evidence revealed that the accused persons had a broader plan for their Scheme beyond the quick inflation of a share’s price for quick and easy profit (for example, see the more rudimentary nature of Dr Tan’s misconduct in Tan Chong Koay (CA) at [186] above). The plan was, in essence, to use the inflated BAL shares as “currency” for corporate acquisitions made by Blumont, Asiasons as well as LionGold. This drew on the First Accused’s ability to secure substantial but informal influence over three Mainboard-listed companies; it tapped on his extensive knowledge of how FIs and financial markets operated; and it sought to put these towards a coordinated and systematic end. Indeed, as I observed at [866] above, had the accused persons’ broad plan been completely executed, there was a chance that their Scheme would not only have eluded discovery by the authorities, it would have shed the usual markers of suspicion which would have triggered an investigation in the first place. 881 As these were matters which went towards the big picture, in deciding whether the Scheme advanced by the Prosecution had in fact existed, it was logical to give the evidence in this category substantial weight. Issue 7: What did the accused persons’ post-Crash conduct reveal?882 I turn to the last issue set out at [192(g)] above; that was, whether the accused persons’ conduct after the Crash supported the conclusion that they had perpetuated the Scheme advanced by the Prosecution. In this connection, the Prosecution principally pointed to conduct under two heads: (a) first, the accused persons’ involvement in settlement negotiations in respect of losses that had been suffered in the Relevant Accounts, as well as their direct settlement of such losses; and (b) second, the acts of the First Accused that formed the subject of the Witness Tampering Charges.Settlement meetings and settlement of losses883 In short, the evidence showed that the accused persons, and, especially the First Accused, had been substantially involved in negotiating settlements with the FIs for the losses suffered as a result of the Crash. The evidence also showed that they had been involved in settling those losses themselves. In particular, the evidence of Mr Tai,

 More importantly, the First Accused did not deny that he had been involved in these settlement meetings or calls.

 was very extensive. Indeed, as I explain from [1250]–[1256] below, the First Accused had even devised or at least sanctioned a plan to set Mr Tai up as the “fall guy” so as to avoid, amongst other things, paying IB for losses suffered in the Relevant Accounts. This was entirely incompatible with his broader defence that he had been doing nothing more than building LionGold up as an Asian mining giant, promoting LionGold shares, and earnestly helping his associates earn money by providing them or their brokers stock tips along the way.885 In my judgment, the evidence instead revealed that the accused persons and, in particular, the First Accused, remained extensively involved in matters pertaining to the Relevant Accounts after the Crash because they had been the ones in control of those accounts. The accountholders were quick to push the responsibility to the accused persons,

 who were, in turn, ready and willing to take on that responsibility for that precise reason. They saw the losses as a consequence of their own actions. Thus, in deciding whether the Scheme advanced by the Prosecution had existed, I took into consideration the fact of the accused persons’ involvement in this regard.The First Accused’s witness tampering886 As stated at [4(e)] above, the First Accused faced eight charges for tampering with four witnesses: (a) Mr Gan; (b) Mr Tai; (c) Mr Chen; and (d) Mr Wong XY (ie, the Witness Tampering Charges). I set out my findings in respect of these charges from [1197]–[1288] below. In summary, I found the First Accused guilty of all eight charges and this, in my view, supported the more general conclusion that the accused persons had indeed entered into a general conspiracy to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. To be clear, I do not mean that it supported any particular allegation. However, the very fact that the First Accused considered it necessary to obstruct the investigations suggested that there was something unlawful to be uncovered. In fact, three of the charges (see [1213], [1236] and [1244]) alleged that the First Accused had tampered with Mr Gan with a view to diverting suspicion away from the Second Accused. If the Second Accused had not been involved in any of the trading activities which led to the Crash, there would be no need for him to seek to misdirect the authorities from her. Summary of my findings on Issue 7887 In sum, the accused persons, particularly the First Accused carried out acts following the Crash which strongly suggested their involvement in a scheme prior to the Crash.Issue 8: Were the accused persons responsible for the Crash?888 As alluded to at [19] above, the accused persons’ responsibility for the Crash was a matter of considerable dispute. However, as my explanation of the elements of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges at [161]–[179] above shows, determining this issue was not a matter which bore on the accused persons’ liability. At most, it could have had a bearing on the potential sentence they were liable to face as an aggravating factor. Accordingly, I will return to it at [1299] below when I set out my decision on sentence.My general findings: Drawing the various threads together889 On the footing of my findings on Issues 1 through to 7, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there existed a general conspiracy between the accused persons to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period. There was ample material which evidenced the fact, mechanics, and objectives of the accused persons’ Scheme. 890 As the foundation, the testimonies of several TRs, coupled with objective evidence, showed that the accused persons set out to pull as many trading accounts as they could within their control (see [730]–[735] above). And, as I stated at [727] above, I found that they had managed to do so in respect of 187 accounts. As I remarked at [516] above, it would have been quite unrealistic to suggest that control over such a large number of trading accounts would have been exercised without some concerted goal in mind. Beyond the mere fact of control, however, the manner in which the accused persons dealt with (see [736]–[772] above) and spoke of these accounts, their accountholders as well as matters connected therewith (see, eg, [773]–[776] above), showed directly that there had been in place an elaborate system which facilitated the coordinated control of the accounts. 891 There was also direct testimony from Mr Leroy Lau and Mr Tai (see [310] and [674] above) that made clear why the accused persons needed to make use of such a great number of trading accounts to perpetuate their Scheme. Simply put, the larger the number of unique accounts and accountholders in the market for BAL shares, the more legitimate the trading appeared to be and, thus, the more their Scheme was cloaked from the relevant authorities. This was effective. Indeed, although the analysis showed that the artificial trading activities undertaken in the Relevant Accounts had been quite brazen, that was only with the benefit of hindsight.892 When these facts were seen alongside Professor Aitken’s analysis of the trading practices deployed in the Relevant Accounts, the “inexorable and irresistible” (per Er Joo Nguang at [35]) conclusion was that the accounts had been controlled with a view to inflating the markets for and prices of Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold shares. For precision, I should restate that I was mindful that Professor Aitken’s instructions were to treat all 189 Relevant Accounts as being under common control. I did not find that to have been the case for Ms Cheng’s CIMB and Credit Suisse accounts. However, the exclusion of these two accounts would hardly have affected his analysis as I observed at [824] above.893 This conclusion was, additionally, capped off with the evidence of Mr Leroy Lau, Mr Tai and Mr Nicholas Ng (see [859]–[869] above) which pinned down why the accused persons had intended to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. It was not for quick profits. Rather, their manipulation had been carried out with a view to using the inflated shares as currency for actual corporate acquisitions. Had this been carried out fully and effectively, Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold may well have legitimised the trading volumes and prices of their shares by reference to real underlying value – value which Mr Ellison found to have been lacking during the Relevant Period. The fact of this plan, in turn, cohered tightly with the First Accused’s extensive involvement with management and business of each of the three companies as I explain in detail from [1158] below.894 In all, the overall weight of the evidence put beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons had conspired to put into effect the Scheme articulated by the Prosecution. While this Scheme did not form the subject of any particular charge (see [9(b)] above), it nevertheless formed the sturdy foundation on which I undertook my analysis of whether the six False Trading and four Price Manipulation Charges had been made out and, further whether the substantive offences underlying each of these ten criminal conspiracy charges, ie, offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, had been completed. I turn to this next. My decision on each of the False Trading ChargesCharge 1: Blumont; from 2 January to 15 March 2013895 My findings in respect of the accused persons’ general conspiracy, as discussed extensively above, were sufficient to determine that each of the six individual False Trading Charges had been made out. In my view, the only question that remained to be addressed was whether the relevant counter had been traded in and amongst the Relevant Accounts during the period of each charge such that the slightly narrower false trading conspiracies could be inferred. 896 In the case of Charge 1, the question was whether Blumont shares had been traded in and amongst the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts from 2 January to 15 March 2013. The answer was “yes”. It suffices to say that of these 187 accounts, many had traded in Blumont shares during the whole period applicable to the False Trading Charges concerning Blumont, ie, 2 January to 3 October 2013.

 In other words, an ample number of controlled Relevant Accounts were specifically involved in the trading of Blumont shares. 897 Next, the investigative work performed by the CAD showed that, as at 31 January 2013, the Relevant Accounts which traded in Blumont shares held 940,496,228 Blumont shares out of a total 1,695,004,586 issued shares. The total number of issued shares remained the same in March 2013, but the number of shares being held by the Relevant Accounts increased to 1,152,737,228 by 21 March 2013.

 This revealed two things. (a) First, in the relatively short period of 2 January and 15 March 2013, the Relevant Accounts had enlarged their Blumont shareholding by more than 200,000,000 or around 13% of the total number of issued shares. This was substantial and indicated the extent to which those accounts contributed to the trading volume of Blumont shares.(b) Second, given that a significant part of the accused persons’ modus operandi was to roll-over contra trades when they fell due, the fact that the Relevant Accounts had been holding onto such a high volume of Blumont shares necessarily meant that the accused persons had to roll a substantial portion of these shares, largely between the Relevant Accounts (see [674] and [782] above). This, in turn, would have generated false trading volume in the market for Blumont shares. This was supported by Professor Aitken’s evidence that wash trading of Blumont shares between the Relevant Accounts took place on almost every trading day from 2 January to 15 March 2013.

898 When these points were coupled with my finding that the markets for BAL shares had generally been inflated (as set out from [817]–[824] above), this led inescapably to the conclusion that the accused persons had “agreed to do acts with the intention of creating a false appearance with respect to the market” for Blumont shares during this period. Thus, I convicted them of Charge 1 accordingly.899 Indeed, there was substantial evidence which showed that they had taken deliberate steps and made coordinated and calculated efforts towards this end. On this basis, I was also satisfied that they each had the intention to create a false appearance as to the market for Blumont shares. For the reasons given at [165]–[171] above, such intention was sufficient to make out the substantive offence underlying the conspiracy charge. Further, I found that the accused persons’ intention to inflate the trading volume of Blumont shares had not merely been an intention. It manifested in tangible results. And, thus, on whichever basis, I held that the substantive offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA had been completed. Charge 2: Blumont; from 18 March to 3 October 2013900 The evidence pertaining to Charge 2 was much the same as that which related to Charge 1. Indeed, the CAD’s investigative work showed that from 21 March 2013, the Relevant Accounts only continued to accumulate even more Blumont shares. By 30 April 2013, the 1,152,737,228 shares held by the accounts as at 21 March had increased to 1,340,542,228, which constituted just under 80% of the total number of issued Blumont shares. From this point until 30 September 2013, the shareholding was largely maintained.

On these premises, I convicted both accused persons of Charge 2.Charge 4: Asiasons; from 1 August 2012 to 15 March 2013902 My reasoning in respect of Charge 4 was largely the same as that in respect of Charges 1 and 2. As a starting point, it should be noted that of the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts, many had traded in Asiasons shares during the Relevant Period.

This figure climbed incrementally over the next few months and, as at 21 March 2013, the Relevant Accounts held 425,186,047 Asiasons shares. This constituted more than 43% of the total number of issued shares which had increased to 973,213,529.

905 Accordingly, once again, for the much the same reasons stated at [896]–[899] above, I was satisfied not only that the accused persons had “agreed to engage in a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the market” for Asiasons shares, but also that the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence underlying Charge 5 had been completed. On these premises, I convicted both accused persons of Charge 5.Charge 8: LionGold; from 1 August 2012 to 15 March 2013906 As a starting point, of the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts, many had traded in LionGold shares during the Relevant Period. In fact, of all three shares, the largest number of Relevant Accounts had traded in LionGold shares.

 Thus, the basic foundation on which the Prosecution’s case had been built (ie, control of the Relevant Accounts) was arguably the strongest in respect of the False Trading Charges pertaining to LionGold shares. However, unlike the case with Blumont and Asiasons, from 1 August 2012 to 15 March 2013, the Relevant Accounts’ LionGold shareholding did not substantially increase. 907 As on 31 August 2012, the Relevant Accounts held 390,017,825 LionGold shares of the total 805,772,346 issued shares. This amounted to just under 49%. By 21 March 2013, although the accounts’ shareholding had gone up to 402,992,264, the total number of issued shares had also risen to 921,934,631. Thus, the accounts’ proportionate shareholding decreased to around 44%.

 That said, commanding between 40% and 50% of a Mainboard-listed share was no mean feat, and the amount of liquidity that would have been generated from the accused persons’ rolling these shares (or, at least, a portion of them) would, equally, have been substantial. This was made abundantly clear by Professor Aitken’s analysis which showed that, between 1 August 2012 and 15 March 2013, the Relevant Accounts engaged in the wash trading of LionGold shares on each and every one of the 155 trading days during this period. In fact, more than this, his analysis showed that between 23% and 88% of the daily LionGold trading volume stemmed from wash trading between the Relevant Accounts. And, on average, 57% of the daily trading volume during this period had been made up of wash trades.

 908 These facts, read with my general conclusion at [889]–[894] above, were highly probative of a specific conspiracy to inflate the liquidity of LionGold shares from 1 August 2012 to 15 March 2013. Thus, for the same essential reasons set out at [896]–[899] above, I was satisfied not only that the accused persons had “agreed to do acts with the intention of creating a false appearance with respect to the market” for LionGold shares, but also that the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence underlying Charge 8 had been completed. On these premises, I convicted both accused persons of Charge 8.Charge 9: LionGold; from 18 March to 3 October 2013909 The evidence in respect of the period from 18 March to 3 October 2013 was even more probative. Although, as stated, the Relevant Accounts did not accumulate proportionately more LionGold shares between 1 August 2012 and 15 March 2013, they did so from 18 March to 3 October 2013. As mentioned, at the start of the period, the accounts held around 44% of the total number of issued shares. By 30 September 2013, this number had increased to 550,708,292 of the total 940,486,540 issued shares. Therefore, by the end of September 2013, the Relevant Accounts held more than 58% of the total number of issued LionGold shares. 910 This was plainly a substantial increase in their market share, and the extent to which the accounts continued to engage in wash trading did not generally subside either. Of the 138 trading days between 18 March and 3 October 2013, there was just one day on which Professor Aitken did not identify wash trading between the Relevant Accounts (cross-reference [784(c)] above). On the days that wash trading had been carried out, they represented between 5% and 96% of LionGold’s total daily trading volume, or, an average of 38%.

 Although the range between minimum and maximum wash trading volumes certainly increased from the earlier period forming the subject of Charge 9, and the daily average dropped, this did not affect the overall picture which arose from all of the evidence. The difference was one of degree and the drop certainly did not suggest that the accused persons’ Scheme in respect of LionGold shares had abated during this period. 911 Therefore, again, for the much the same reasons stated at [896]–[899] above, I was satisfied not only that the accused persons had “agreed to cause certain acts to be done, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance with respect to the price” for LionGold shares, but also that the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence underlying Charge 9 had been completed. On these premises, I convicted both accused persons of Charge 9.My decision on each of the Price Manipulation ChargesCharge 3: Blumont; on 2 and 3 October 2013912 In respect of both 2 and 3 October 2013, the Prosecution relied on two strands of evidence to prove its case. First, the direct evidence of Ms Cheng, Mr Tai and Mr Leroy Lau, who each spoke of the accused persons instructing them to “defend” the market.

I have mentioned Ms Cheng’s evidence at [426] above. Mr Tai’s evidence was, similarly, that shortly before the Crash, the accused persons had instructed him to place substantial buy orders at the best bid, and to wait for his orders to be hit.

 Mr Tan BK’s account entered three buy orders. 915 As highlighted by Professor Aitken, the selling volume for Blumont shares on 1 to 3 October 2013 had quadrupled from the average selling volume for September 2013. In September 2013, the market participants other than the Relevant Accounts had sold, on average, around 2,400,000 Blumont shares per day. Within the first three days of October 2013, this increased to around 10,600,000. Yet, notwithstanding this sharp increase in selling pressure, the price of Blumont shares did not drop substantially on 2 October 2013. The best bid at the start of the trading day was S$2.52

 and for most of the day, it maintained at S$2.38. In this connection, Professor Aitken noted: “although no algorithms [had been] triggered on 2 October, … the price of Blumont was relatively stable from 9.03.09am. This was because the [Relevant] Accounts [had] placed substantial buy orders at the best bid of S$2.38 throughout the day. The [Relevant] Accounts placed a total of 13 buy orders throughout the day, 10 of which were for the purchase of 1 million shares each. Through these buy orders, the [Relevant] Accounts effectively set a price floor at S$2.38” [emphasis added].

 916 This brings me back to the buy orders entered by Mr Tai. The first bid for 1,000,000 which had been entered in Mr Chen’s account at 9.00.01am traded out within 11 minutes at 9.10.58am. And, just 12 seconds later, the second bid for another 1,000,000 shares was placed at 9.11.10am. At 9.16.23am, this second bid traded out, and a further seven seconds later, the third bid for 1,000,000 shares was placed in Mr Chen’s account at 9.16.30am. This was traded out at 9.18.53am, and again, just 11 seconds later, the fourth bid for 1,000,000 was placed in Mr Chen’s account at 9.19.04am. Thereafter, the trading volume started to decrease, and the last two orders in Mr Chen’s accounts, as well as the orders in Mr Neo and Mr Tan BK’s accounts became slightly more spread out over the day, though no less logically timed to keep the price of Blumont shares fixed around S$2.38. 917 Mr White did not address this charge specifically in his report,

 was that Mr Tai had not been acting under their control but, rather, had coordinated with Mr Gwee so as to allow the latter to make money from the sale of Blumont shares to the accounts under Mr Tai’s control. Effectively, this was an allegation that Mr Tai had been using the limited power of attorney he had over the Relevant Accounts under his management to cheat the accountholders and allow Mr Gwee to profit therefrom.918 As stated at [694] above, I found that the accused persons had been the ones in control of the IB accounts under Mr Tai’s management for the whole of the Relevant Period, and the Defence’s case in respect of Charge 3 specifically did not undermine that general finding. In any event, the narrative put forth by the Defence simply did not account for the manner in which Mr Tai had actually been trading:(a) One, the shares which Mr Gwee had supposedly been attempting to sell to Mr Tai were those from his brother’s account (one Mr Eugene Gwee).

 The Blumont sell orders entered in this account on 2 October 2013 totalled 3,775,000 shares. However, less than one-third of these shares, just 1,079,000, had traded against the buy orders entered by Mr Tai in the IB accounts.

 (b) Two, in the face of strong selling pressure, there was nothing suggested by the Defence which could explain why Mr Tai would have placed buy orders for more than 6,000,000 Blumont shares in excess of his alleged scheme to coordinate trades with Mr Gwee to enable the latter to profit off the Relevant Accountholders. If the point was to buy up the Blumont shares from Mr Eugene Gwee’s account, and Mr Tai and Mr Gwee had been coordinating their trades to that end, one would expect the total volume of buy orders entered by Mr Tai to at least somewhat match the total volume of sell orders entered in Mr Eugene Gwee’s account of 3,775,000 shares.(c) Three, there was also nothing which explained the timing of the trades. Indeed, when I reviewed the primary SGX data for Blumont shares, I saw that the market participants selling to Mr Tai were largely non-Relevant Accounts. For example, the bid for 1,000,000 Blumont shares entered at 9.00.01am traded against 27 sell orders, most of which were for relatively small quantities, all of which had been entered by non-Relevant Accounts.

 This was more consistent with the Prosecution’s case that the buy orders which had been entered in the Relevant Accounts at this time served to match the selling pressure with buyers and, therefore, abate the downward pressure being applied to the price of Blumont shares. 919 I now return to Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence, which also shed light on the difficulties with the positions taken by the First Accused at trial. On 2 October 2013, at 8.09.45pm, the First Accused responded to a message from Mr Leroy Lau about a deal they had been working on.

 I found these messages highly revealing of how the First Accused saw the situation; and, the line “[a]ll funds to the market”, in particular, strongly suggested that the preventive actions being taken against the downwards-trending market (eg, the buy orders entered by Mr Tai) had been directed by the First Accused. Indeed, these messages supported Mr Leroy Lau’s testimony that 2 and 3 October 2013 were days on which the First Accused had specifically asked him to support the price of Blumont shares.

920 Naturally, the First Accused denied instructing anyone to “defend” the price of Blumont shares. However, he went slightly further to distance himself from these transactions. During cross-examination, the First Accused explained that, although he had been aware of the fact that there was some selling pressure in respect of Blumont shares, he had not even been watching the counter’s prices at the time.

 Not only did this contradict his own messages to Mr Leroy Lau, it also ran counter to the message he had sent to Ms Cheng asking her to purchase half a million Blumont shares on 2 October 2013 (see [426] above). I therefore did not believe the First Accused and rejected his explanation accordingly.921 I do not propose to set out the many other Blumont orders and trades entered on that day in the Relevant Accounts to make the point which underpinned the First Accused’s message to Mr Leroy Lau that they were taking “[a]ll funds into the market”. It is sufficient to cite Professor Aitken’s evidence that, on 3 October 2013, the Relevant Accounts had “consistently made large purchases for Blumont shares at price levels around $2.38 during the first half of the trading session, supporting the share price of Blumont at $2.38”.

 I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons had conspired to support the price of Blumont shares on 2 and 3 October 2013.922 The evidence evinced a degree of coordination which, in my view, led irresistibly to the inference that the two accused persons must have had agreed to do certain acts, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance as to the price of Blumont shares. The acts on which they agreed were then carried out. Accordingly, I convicted them of Charge 3, and found that the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence which formed the subject of their criminal conspiracy had also been made out.Charge 6: Asiasons; in September 2013923 The period of this charge was the month of September 2013. The starting point of my assessment was to consider Professor Aitken’s evidence. There were 19 days in September 2013 on which Asiasons shares had been traded, and Professor Aitken’s starting point was to exclude consideration of four days in light of the fact that potentially price sensitive information had been released on those days. As for the 15 remaining trading days, he observed that several manipulative trading techniques seemed to have been employed to push the price both up and down.

 The new trading strategy featured consistently throughout September 2013. [Twelve] successful efforts to push up the price over a period of 10 days is extremely frequent and accordingly suspicious. 26 September 2013 even featured five separate efforts respectively to push up Asiasons’ price over the course of the trading day. This leaves me in little doubt that the price push-ups were not likely to have been done inadvertently and I could find no obvious reason for the price movements such as price sensitive information.[emphasis added]924 Mr White’s instructions and thus approach was not to address the specific periods of the individual False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. Rather, he was told to “investigate several groups of accounts, analyse their dealings with each other and consider whether one or more of these groups may have [been] act[ing] in concert”.

 This being the case, and given that I had found as a matter of fact that the accused persons had been controlling 187 of the total 189 Relevant Accounts, there was little which I could make of Mr White’s evidence against Professor Aitken’s. 925 Accordingly, I accepted Professor Aitken’s opinion which, indeed, also cohered with the facts more generally. For example, as set out at [96]–[97] above, Mr Tai gave evidence regarding instructions he had received from the First Accused on 12 September 2013 to push down the price of Asiasons shares ahead of the Black Elk deal. This was entirely consistent with Professor Aitken’s observations that the Relevant Accounts managed to, on this date, push the price of Asiasons shares by “a remarkable 12 price steps, momentarily bucking the upward price trend which the [Relevant] Accounts had been creating [until then]”.

 Coupled with: (a) the direct evidence of both Mr Tai and Mr Leroy Lau as regards how they had subsequently taken steps to push up the price of Asiasons shares on 17 September 2013 following the company’s announcement of its potential acquisition of Black Elk (see [98]–[99] above); and (b) my finding that the First Accused had planned to use Asiasons shares to engage in share swaps to make corporate acquisitions (see [853]–[869] above), I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons had indeed conspired to carry out a course of conduct, a purpose of which was to create a false appearance as to the price of Asiasons shares. Accordingly, I convicted them of Charge 6. To be clear, given the manner in which the price of Asiasons moved up and down during the month of September 2013, I was also satisfied that the accused persons had successfully completed the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence underlying this charge.926 For completeness, I should note that the Prosecution invited me to consider Mr Tai’s evidence on instances where the First Accused had allegedly instructed him to manipulate the price of Asiasons shares outside of September 2013. These instances, they submitted, “[were] relevant in showing the extent to which [the First Accused] [had been] very prepared to manipulate the price of the counter in order to achieve his purposes”.

927 This was not, in my view, a complete or proper submission. The Prosecution had preferred a charge for the month of September 2013 and the evidence on which they advanced their submissions should have focused on making out the charge for the period which they preferred. It may well have been that the First Accused had instructed Mr Tai to manipulate the price of Asiasons shares during earlier period, outside of September 2013. However, for this to have been relevant to and admissible as proof of this specific charge, the Prosecution would have needed to make submissions on the point, presumably under either ss 14 or 15 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). However, they did not do so,

 and the Defence therefore did not have an opportunity to address the point in reply. Accordingly, I declined to take such instances into account. In any case, I: (a) would not have considered such past activities particularly probative given the specific mens rea that needed to be proved for Charge 6; and (b) did not think it was ultimately necessary given the strong evidence of Mr Tai, Mr Leroy Lau and Professor Aitken which directly addressed the month of September 2013. Charge 7: Asiasons from 1 to 3 October 2013928 Having found that the accused persons had been in control of 187 out of 189 of the Relevant accounts, the key piece of evidence on which I relied in assessing this charge was that of Professor Aitken. His general observation was that the Relevant Accounts had continued their trading strategy from September 2013, and that strategy “was still that of pushing up prices”.

929 The starting point of his analysis was 30 September 2013, when the price of Asiasons “rapidly declined from S$2.84 within the last 5 minutes of trading and closed at S$2.70”. Thereafter, on 1 October 2013, he observed that the Relevant Accounts had managed to turn this around through “aggressive buying”, pushing the price of Asiasons up from S$2.73 at the open to S$2.86 within the first 12 minutes of the day.

This bid executed against several non-Relevant Accounts instantly (note that the order was not fully executed – 132,000 shares were left on the bid).

Again, this bid instantly traded against several sell orders, pushing the price best ask up to S$2.77 before it was even completed (note that the order did not execute fully as 75,000 shares were left on the bid).

 and I do not propose to repeat the details of those trades to make the same essential point. What is more salient to note is Professor Aitken’s observation that, in light of the high volume of sell orders being placed in the market at this time, if the persons behind these accounts had genuinely wished to pick up Asiasons shares, they would have put themselves in the queue and waited for their bids to be hit. Thus, he suggested that the manner in which they placed their orders, closing the bid-ask spread, was not something that was rational in the circumstances.

Given that the price had in fact been supported at levels it would not otherwise have been without the intervention of the accused persons, I was additionally satisfied that their conspiracy had in fact been carried out. I therefore convicted them of Charge 7 on these premises.Charge 10: LionGold; in August and September 2013934 The period of this final Price Manipulation Charge was August and September 2013. Once again, the starting point of my analysis was Professor Aitken’s evidence. There was a total of 40 days on which LionGold’s shares had been traded during this period. Of these, Professor Aitken excluded 13 days from his analysis as potentially price sensitive information had been released on those days. Of the balance 27 days, he found that several manipulative trading practices had been triggered on multiple days.

936 I reviewed the underlying trade and telecommunications data, and I was satisfied that this had, in fact, been carried out. Indeed, beyond the morning (which, for some reason, was the period of time on which Professor Aitken focused), the Relevant Accounts, not limited to Mr Leroy Lau’s account, had pushed the price of the share up to a relatively stable S$1.235,

 which was the price at which LionGold opened on the next day. I was also mindful of the evidence referenced by the Prosecution which suggested an appreciable degree of trading coordination between Mr Leroy Lau’s account and the other controlled Relevant Accounts.

 I considered these submissions as well as the underlying evidence carefully, and they did not affect my general decision to accept Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence (see [308]–[322] above). In my judgment, the attacks levelled against Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence as regards this particular charge did not address either: (a) the broader context of his testimony which was supported by the objective evidence; or (b) the evidence of coordination referenced by the Prosecution. I therefore found that the LionGold price hikes on 6 August 2013 were, on Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence, driven by the accused persons. 938 I turn to the next salient incident, which took place on 26 September 2013. On this day, Mr Leroy Lau observed that the buy-in circular published by the SGX reflected that there had been a high number of short sellers for LionGold (5,954,000 shares).

 On Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence, after he had seen the circular, he contacted the accused persons to ask whether they were the ones shorting LionGold. As they informed him that they were not, Mr Leroy Lau shared with them his plan to use this opportunity to push the price of LionGold upwards, make some money from the SGX, and, as a by-product, the plan also punished the market participants who had been shorting the share.

… Once they confirmed that they were not responsible for the short selling, I explained to them that we could profit from this situation by taking the following steps in sequence:(a) I would buy up LionGold shares and push-up the market price in order to create a higher Buy-In price;(b) [The First Accused (“John”)] and [the Second Accused (“Su-Ling”)] would arrange for their brokers to sell millions of their free balance shares to the Buy-In at this higher Buy-In price. I add here that generally, brokers are keen to sell their shares to SGX during the Buy-In because the price is favourable. As such, for most stocks, it is very difficult to successfully sell to SGX during the Buy-In. However, I knew that this plan would work in LionGold’s case, because John and Su-Ling controlled a majority of LionGold’s shares, and they were the only ones who had and were thus able to supply such a large amount of free balance shares in LionGold to the Buy-ln. They were in a position to deploy these shares to sell to SGX at short notice because they either owned or controlled these free balance shares of LionGold; and(c) After the Buy-In was complete, John and Su-Ling would subsequently buy the free balance shares they had sold back from the market (including buying the shares which I had purchased at (a) above).The group would earn an arbitrage profit by buying back their free balance shares at a lower price (at (c)) than that which they had sold it to SGX at (at (b)). John and Su-Ling would also profit because the contra positions which Su-Ling had accumulated over the past few days could be sold at the new higher price established. I would also stand to profit by selling the shares, which I would be purchasing (at (a)) on the same day, at around the new higher prices established after the Buy-In.939 The accused persons agreed with this plan, whereupon Mr Leroy Lau, in coordination with the accused persons, took steps to push the price of LionGold shares up and sell shares to the exchange as part of the buy-in. That this plan had been successfully executed by Mr Leroy Lau and the accused persons could be readily discerned from the objective evidence:(a) One, between the short span of time between 2.08pm and 2.30pm, Mr Leroy Lau and the accused persons managed to push the best ask for LionGold shares up from S$1.54 to S$1.71.

 and I did not accept them. To explain why, I simply highlight one piercing observation made by the Prosecution. The Prosecution noted the Defence’s position that Mr Leroy Lau was the one who had carried out these acts, and that he was attempting to pin the blame (if any) on the accused persons. In response, the Prosecution highlighted that the very manner in which Mr Leroy Lau gave his evidence was a concession that he had been the one to propose this scheme.

 So, while he was including the accused persons, he was doing so in his scheme, which implicated himself above them. I was quite persuaded by this, and I hasten to add that, in the course of this trial, the Defence took great exception to the Prosecution’s decision not to prefer charges against numerous individuals who were deeply involved in the framework of the accused persons’ Scheme. This was raised to call into question the veracity of many witnesses’ evidence, on the basis that they had proffered evidence for immunity from prosecution. This was a claim without merit, and I will return to my observations on the various allegations of Prosecutorial misconduct at [1460] below.(b) Second, as a matter of law, the Defence submitted that even if Mr Leroy Lau’s evidence were to be accepted, it was not illegal to capitalise on the SGX’s practice to make profits.

 I did not accept this. The very essence of Mr Leroy Lau’s plan was to artificially inflate the price of LionGold shares, through a coordinated effort which would not normally be possible. Indeed, as set out at [938] above, he specifically testified: “generally, brokers are very keen to sell their shares to SGX during the Buy-In because the Price is favourable. As such, for most stocks, it is very difficult to successfully sell to SGX during the Buy-In. However, I knew that this plan would work in LionGold’s case because John and Su-Ling controlled a majority of LionGold’s shares, and they were the only ones who had and were thus able to supply such a large amount of free balance shares in LionGold to the Buy-In” [emphasis added]. Even though this was an opportunity created by the SGX, stretching the opportunity in this manner squarely crossed the line into creating a false appearance as to the price of LionGold shares.941 There were other series of trades highlighted by Professor Aitken which he opined had manipulated the price of LionGold shares in August and September 2013, and which I took into consideration.

 I do not propose to set them out here. Instead, it simply bears reminding that my task was not to identify specific instances of conduct prohibited by s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. It was to decide if the accused persons had conspired to manipulate the price of LionGold shares in August and September 2013.942 In this regard, Professor Aitken’s evidence was that false appearances had been created as to the price of LionGold shares by the Relevant Accounts. Seeing as how I found that 187 of these accounts had been controlled by the accused persons, I saw a clear basis to rely on his evidence in reaching the same general conclusion. Both on this general basis as well as upon my consideration of the specific instances of manipulative trading activity seen in the Relevant Accounts, I found, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused persons had conspired to engage in a course of conduct a purpose of which was to create a false appearance as to the price of LionGold shares in the months of August and September 2013. I accordingly convicted them of Charge 10 and, given that fact that there were certainly instances on which such manipulative activity had actually been carried out, I additionally found that the substantive s 197(1)(b) offence underlying this charge had been completed.Summary: The False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges943 In summary, I convicted the accused persons of all six False Trading and all four Price Manipulation Charges which had been brought against them. In respect of each of these ten conspiracy charges, I found that the accused persons had also completed the underlying substantive offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA and this, in turn, had consequences in terms of sentencing (see [1319]–[1339] and [1352]–[1390] below).The Deception Charges944 I have addressed in considerable detail above, control of the Relevant Accounts. In respect of most of these accounts, the accused persons were not formally authorised to giving trading instructions, these were the 161 accounts I placed in Groups 1 and 3, and the Manhattan House Group (see [200] above). Further to this, as I have stated at various points above (eg, see [508]–[517]), the accused persons’ control was concealed from the FIs. For their unauthorised and concealed control of these accounts, the accused persons faced the Deception Charges. By these charges, the Prosecution alleged that the accused persons conspired to conceal from the FIs their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades each of the 161 accounts. Such concealment was likely to operate as a deception upon the FIs, and, thus, it was said to amount to an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA.945 My grounds in this section will proceed in six parts. First, I will set out a sample Deception Charge. Second, I will state my conclusions in respect of the Defence’s submission that the charges were not sufficiently particularised (see [141] above). Third, I will address whether the specific conduct alleged by the Deception Charges even amounted to an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA. Fourth, I will state the standard of proof the Prosecution was required to meet in order to prove each specific conspiracy alleged by each Deception Charge. Fifth, I will explain how the Relevant Accounts are grouped in this section for the purposes of the Deception Charges. Finally, I will state my reasons for each account in those groups.The charges946 A sample Deception Charge brought against the First Accused was:

CHARGE 11That you, Soh Chee Wen, on or about 13 March 2013, through to 3 October 2013, in Singapore, were party to a criminal conspiracy with one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”) to commit an offence under section 201(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”), to wit, you and Quah agreed to engage in a practice which was likely to operate as a deception upon AmFraser Securities Pte Ltd (nka KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd) (the “Firm”), directly in connection with the purchase or sale of shares in Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd (the “Securities”), bodies corporate whose shares were traded on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, a securities exchange in Singapore, which practice was to conceal the involvement of you and Quah in the instructing of orders and trades of the Securities in the account of one Peter Chen Hing Woon (account no. 01-0030921) maintained with the Firm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224) read with section 204(1) of the SFA.[emphasis added]947 The differences between each of the 161 Deception Charges related to: (a) the material period of the deception; (b) the FI that was deceived; (c) the specific account in which the orders were instructed; and (d) the particular share or shares purchased and sold (ie, either Blumont, Asiasons, LionGold, or some combination of the three). Otherwise, each of the 161 Deception Charges contained the same substantive allegation.Preliminary issue 1: Whether the charges were sufficiently particularised948 As I explained from [34]–[49], there were variations in terms of how each account was said to be have been controlled.949 To reiterate, the Prosecution advanced three main methods by which the accused persons had exercised control over the Relevant Accounts.

 First, in respect of the Local Accounts generally, it was broadly the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had directly instructed the TRs. Second, in respect of certain Local Accounts, as well as all Foreign Accounts, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused persons had given instructions by relaying them through Relevant Accountholders, or by instructing intermediaries. The intermediaries could either enter the trade orders themselves or convey them to a TR or trading desk officer who would enter the order. Third, the Prosecution alleged that the accused persons had also delegated the task of instructing or placing BAL trades to three individuals, Mr Gwee, Mr Gan, and Mr Tai. 950 It will be observed that these three methods by which the accused persons were said to have exercised control over the Relevant Accounts did not constitute a part of the sample Deception Charge set out at [946] above. That they were not included in the charges formed a salient part of this case’s procedural history (see [1502]–[1506] below).951 Throughout the trial, the Defence made much of the Prosecution’s supposed failure to supply adequate particulars in the charges. Initially, this objection was taken against the Prosecution’s original charges for abetment by conspiracy (see [21] above). Thereafter, when the Prosecution applied to amend those charges to charges for criminal conspiracy, it produced a document titled “Annex B – Information relating to 11th to 172nd charges under section 201 SFA” (“Annex B”).

 This contained the Prosecution’s case in respect of each account which formed the subject of a Deception Charge. For example, at [203] above, where I began my analysis on the accused persons’ control of the Relevant Accounts, I stated that it was the Prosecution’s case that both accused persons had given direct trading instructions to Ms Ang in respect of Mr Chen’s two accounts held with UOB Kay Hian. Such allegation, among others, were included in Annex B.952 In resisting the Prosecution’s application to amend the charges, the Defence argued that Annex B was insufficient.

 Thus, it was queried whether, if the amendment application was to be allowed, the allegations set out in Annex B ought to be incorporated directly into the charges. If not, it needed to be determined how, then, they ought to be regarded.

 The Prosecution argued that Annex B ought simply to be read with their opening statement as part of their evidential case. That was, the evidence they intended to adduce to prove the amended charges as drafted, without the allegations specified in Annex B. The Defence’s position, naturally, was that the allegations should form part of the charges. 953 Ultimately, I allowed the Prosecution’s application to amend the charges and agreed with them that the then-new conspiracy charges contained sufficient particulars.

954 It was against this backdrop that the Defence made the following contentions at the end of trial. By failing to commit to a position in the charges, and, indeed, even failing to commit to the positions in the subsequently-provided Annex B, the Prosecution allowed themselves to adapt their case to the detriment of the Defence’s ability to answer such case.

 Thus, because of the detriment caused to the Defence, it was said that the Prosecution “should not be able to say that [Annex B] [did] not constitute part of the charges”. Five supporting arguments underpinned this:
                   2101

(a) The whole purpose of asking for particularisation was so that the Defence could rely on the particulars for the purposes of running their case and cross-examining Prosecution witnesses;(b) The Prosecution’s position that [Annex B] does not constitute part of the charges is problematic because it would mean that the Prosecution can amend the Information Table at any time without seeking the Court’s approval (as opposed to an amendment of charges);(c) This is not a hypothetical problem as the Prosecution did indeed the amend [Annex B] on more than one occasion;(d) Therefore, [Annex B] should be considered as part of the charges. If what had originally been written in the [Annex B] has not been proven by the Prosecution, or has been disproved by the Defence, then the accused persons cannot be convicted on those charges. Similarly, if the Prosecution had amended [Annex B], they cannot argue that the Defence has not met their new case; and(e) Conversely, if the Prosecution insists that [Annex B] does not form part of the charges, then the Deception Charges remain insufficiently particularised. If each charge does not set out whether the trading instructions were given directly or indirectly, then it is unclear as to what evidence the Accused Persons should be convicted on, and it would be unsafe to convict them.[footnotes omitted]955 In short, I did not accept this as it was essentially relitigating the issues that I had addressed when I considered the Prosecution’s application to amend the charges in the first place. However, quite apart from that, I also substantively did not agree with the Defence’s argument because, irrespective of the Prosecution’s case on how control was exactly exercised over each of the Relevant Accounts, the two vital questions which the Defence needed to address were constant throughout the trial. The first question was simply whether they (the accused persons) had controlled and used the Relevant Accounts. Their answer to this question was “no”, and they had taken this position since the beginning of the trial. Thus, the second question which then arose as a consequence of the accused persons’ denial of control, was why a substantial number of Relevant Accountholders, TRs as well as intermediaries had come forth to give evidence that they had in fact exercised such control.956 I accepted that the second question was probably easier to answer by reference to specific allegations as to the mode of control which the accused persons were supposed to have used. However, I did not find that the absence of such specific allegations in the charges had hindered the accused persons’ ability to answer the case against them. As stated, it was their consistent case from the outset, that they simply had not exercised control over any of the Relevant Accounts. And, when the First Accused took the stand, he managed to respond comprehensively to the numerous allegations made by the various witnesses against him. Indeed, as the Second Accused elected to remain silent, he was even able to give responses that were aimed at defending her position. In this light, I did not think that the mere fact that Annex B did not constitute part of the Deception Charges prejudiced the Defence in any way. 957 I therefore rejected the argument that the Deception Charges were not sufficiently particularised and that this ought to have affected my determinations in respect of liability.Preliminary issue 2: The scope of s 201(b) of the SFA958 To begin, the relevant version of s 201(b) of the SFA read:Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices201. No person shall, directly or indirectly, in connection with the subscription, purchase or sale of any securities —(b) engage in any act, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deception, or is likely to operate as a fraud or deception, upon any person;959 This provision created a “catch-all” prohibition (Public Prosecutor v Cheong Hock Lai and other appeals [2004] 3 SLR(R) 203 at [41]). Accordingly, in applying s 201(b), it was important to identify the specific type of act, practice, or course of business which was purportedly deceptive. In this case, the operative allegation was that the accused persons had conspired to “conceal [their] involvement … in the instructing of orders and trades” in a specified Relevant Account. The word “involvement” was plainly broad, and it was therefore the Prosecution’s position that, irrespective of the manner in which the accused persons instructed trades, whether directly, relaying through another, or by a delegate, they were still ultimately “involved” in the order or trade without proper authorisation.

 an established subcategory of deceitful practices under s 201(b) which involved using another’s trading account to place orders without the authorisation of either the accountholder or the securities trading firm (Ng Geok Eng v Public Prosecutor [2007] 1 SLR(R) 913 (“Ng Geok Eng”) at [35]–[36]).960 Although, superficially, the deceptive practice alleged appeared to fall within the category of “unauthorised share trading”, this was not entirely accurate because the charges in Ng Geok Eng had specifically alleged that the accused “us[ed] [the accountholder’s] trading account to conduct trades in [company] shares without duly notifying the [financial institution] in writing nor seeking its prior consent, which trades were carried out for your own benefit” [emphasis added] (Ng Geok Eng at [2]). Thus, the lack of consent of the financial institution in Ng Geok Eng pertained to two matters. First, the act of conducting the trades, and, second, the fact that those trades were beneficially those of the offender, not the accountholder.961 The latter allegation was not made in the Deception Charges. Accordingly, by this omission, the Prosecution were, in effect, suggesting that the act of concealing one’s “involvement in the instructing of orders and trades”, irrespective of whether those trades were beneficially those of the accused person or not, fell within the prohibition created by s 201(b) of the SFA. This was permissible given the breadth of the provision. Even so, however, the deceptive practice allegedly used in this case, could not be treated as an established sub-category of offences on the authority of Ng Geok Eng.962 This gave rise to a question about the scope of s 201(b) of the SFA. Absent the specific allegation that the Relevant Accountholders had been the accused persons’ nominees and proof thereof, was it an offence under s 201(b) for the accused persons to have “concealed their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades” in the Relevant Accounts? Did such an act of concealment, without more, constitute a practice that was “likely to operate as a deception” upon the FIs? I answered this question in the affirmative. This requires some explanation.963 The starting point was to examine the nature of the relationship between accountholders and the FIs with which their accounts are held. Virtually all agreements between FIs and a client to open securities trading accounts would contain a clause by which the latter warrants that they are the beneficial owner of any trades entered using that account.

 The purpose of warranties like these should be clear in light of AML and CFT frameworks; therefore, it should also be clear why the breach of such warranties could logically form the basis of a charge under s 201(b) of the SFA.964 However, unlike the prohibition against nominee trading, the rationale behind the need for formal written authorisation for its own sake was less clear. Consider, for example, the evidence of Mr Tan SK. He testified that:

The need for written authorisation, and for [know-your-client (“KYC”)] and [customer-due-diligence (“CDD”)] checks to be conducted on the mandate holder, stem from paragraphs 4.10 and 4.11 of MAS Notice SFA04-N02 dated 2 July 2007 (the version in force during the 2012-2013 period). They guard against the risk of the mandate owner being the beneficial owner of the account, and the risk of the account being used for illegal purposes. I refer to the exhibit marked {MAS-2}. This is a copy of the MAS Notice SFA04-N02 in force during the 2012–2013 period.…[AmFraser] does not allow unauthorised parties to give trading instructions for several reasons.First, there is a risk of the account holder disputing the trade placed by the unauthorised party. This can result in [AmFraser] suffering financial loss since [AmFraser] is responsible for settlement with CDP on the due date of a trade. This exposes [AmFraser] to the risk of the client failing to settle subsequently.Second, it raises the possibility that the unauthorised party, as opposed to the account holder, is the actual beneficial owner of the account. Where third-party beneficial ownership is concealed from [AmFraser], [AmFraser] would not be able to conduct the relevant KYC and CDD checks on such persons as it would do on all mandate holders. In such cases, there is a clear risk of an account being abused for illegal purposes such as money-laundering and market manipulationI would add that unauthorised trading, as well as hidden third-party beneficial ownership, is very difficult for a brokerage to detect. [AmFraser] would not know who is giving trading instructions for account, and must rely on TRs to ensure that only authorised parties are permitted to trade. This underscores the importance of written authorisation being required before a third-party is allowed to trade.[emphasis added]965 Representatives of the other FIs with which the Deception Charges were concerned gave the same or very similar reasons for requiring written authorisation.

966 On the face of such evidence, it was clear that the FIs were not interested in the mere formality of written authorisation. Rather, they were concerned with the associated risks and consequences which tended to arise where third parties use or are involved in the use of an account without formal written authorisation. Chief amongst which is nominee trading, though other illegal trading practices may be of concern as well. Put simply, involvement in the use of an account without formal written authorisation is an indicium of nominee trading or other unlawful trading activity, and the requirement of such formal authorisation assists in the minimisation of associated risks.967 Certainly, such risks are not abated simply by the grant of formal written authorisation. A formally authorised individual may still abuse his authority and carry out nominee trading or even illegal trading activity in that account. However, the very process of approving a third-party’s formal authorisation would also have given the FI an opportunity to ensure that all is well with the third party. Not every individual who seeks to obtain authorisation to place trades in another’s account has Machiavellian intentions. Some may have such intentions, but those are likely identifiable by the usual red flags an FI would know to look out for before sanctioning the third party’s authorisation. Indeed, had the need for formal authorisation been complied with in this case, there would likely have been a point where the FIs questioned why the two accused persons were authorised to place trades in so many seemingly unconnected accounts. That would have raised suspicions earlier on. 968 I return then to the question at [962] above. As the FIs did not seem to be concerned with imposing the requirement of formal written authorisation for its own sake, it appeared that the Prosecution’s framing of the Deception Charges was too broad to fall within s 201(b) of the SFA. After all, “involvement” could have ranged from giving a casual stock tip to the user of an account, to exercising absolute control of that account. The point at which “involvement” engaged the FIs’ actual concerns and, therefore, necessitated formal written authorisation, was quite unclear. 969 Indeed, I should also state that it was not even entirely clear why these charges had been framed so broadly. It was the Prosecution’s clear case, from the very outset of this matter, that the Relevant Accounts had not only been controlled by the accused persons, but, further, that the Relevant Accountholders were also the accused persons’ “nominees”.

 Such characterisation of the Relevant Accountholders as “nominees” plainly implied that the Prosecution saw them as lacking beneficial ownership of the shares traded in their accounts. Conversely, if they were the accused persons’ nominees, the import was that the beneficial ownership laid with the accused persons instead. Therefore, on the Prosecution’s own stated case, the Deception Charges could have been drafted on terms similar to that seen in Ng Geok Eng. This would have avoided the need to query what types of “involvement” actually engaged a real systemic concern such that it should be sanctioned by s 201(b) of the SFA. 970 That said, I must hasten to add that, although the Deception Charges could have been drafted in that manner, it was never the Defence’s case that the Deception Charges should have been amended so as to require the Prosecution to prove that the accused persons were the beneficial owners of the shares traded in the Relevant Accounts. Instead, the matter with which the Defence took issue was that the meaning of the word “involvement”, whether by direct control, indirect control, or delegation, had not been particularised in the Deception Charges themselves. At no point did the Defence suggest that the Deception Charges were not supportable by law in the first place. In fact, when I had raised this issue when the parties made their oral closing submissions, Mr Sreenivasan stated:

I now come to the next general area which is a problem. Control of accounts. You know, when we look at it, the prosecution is quite happy to jump on the word “nominee”. Of course, when one uses the word “nominee”, it will mean that the principal is a beneficial owner.Your Honour had touched on this in clarifying some points, because the real problem we have with this area is what exactly would the deception charges cover. If my friend calls me up and says ABC is a good buy and I buy, it doesn’t. If go and call up 20 different people and tell them that ABC is a good buy so they will move the market, [that] may be market manipulation. If I am enthusiastic about a company and I keep talking about it, is that market manipulation? If I give advice, is it market manipulation? If I gave a stock tip?[emphasis added]971 It was clear to me from this submission that the Defence’s concern was the breadth of the Deception Charges and their alleged lack of particulars. I did not understand them to be concerned with the prior question of whether the practice of being “involved” in the instructing of orders and trades in the Relevant Accounts even constituted an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA. Their objection to the lack of particulars, however, has been dealt with at [948]–[957] above and I do not say more on that issue.972 Returning to the instant issue. The Prosecution pressed the view that the deceptive practice alleged in the Deception Charges, even if not strictly on the authority of Ng Geok Eng, was nevertheless conduct sanctioned by s 201(b) of the SFA.

Our submission is that the deception conduct that’s sanctioned by section 201 is not confined to a situation where it is the ultimate beneficial owner that is being concealed. Instead, if there is another third party unbeknownst to the FI who makes the decision, makes the call as to what the trades to be placed as opposed to guidance or advice which we do not accept on the evidence, if he is the decision-maker, then the FI reps have given evidence that that is a matter of concern to them, they would want to know who actually decides on the trades, because that could affect -- that could lead to possible risk for them in terms of credit risk, reputational risk, legal risk. The FI reps have testified to that effect.So the operative deception here is the fact that the accused persons are hiding, concealing the fact that they are the true decision-makers behind the trades.973 The main difficulty with the Prosecution’s view was the fact that, on a plain reading of the Deception Charges, there was considerable room for the word “involvement” to be interpreted broadly, and, if so, their charge could equally catch many largely innocuous practices. For example, Mr Hong’s evidence was that the First Accused had not used his accounts to trade. Rather, the First Accused had only given him financial advice or stock tips. This was consistent with the position the First Accused took when he gave evidence. Assuming, contrary to my findings, that this was true, ie, the trades executed in Mr Hong’s accounts were beneficially his own save that they were entered with the First Accused’s advice in mind, the question which arose was then whether the First Accused’s “involvement” in this sense could still be said to be conduct “likely to operate as a deception”. Many investors take informal advice on the trades they ought to enter, and the more prominent the advisor, the more likely such advice would be acted upon as given.974 The breadth of the Deception Charges was thus somewhat unsatisfactory. However, those problems aside, I ultimately took the view that the word “involvement” could be restrictively understood so as to avoid casting the potential scope of s 201(b) too widely. In my judgment, this view was justified because bare “involvement” in an account, even if beneficial ownership or illegal activity had not strictly been proven, was an important lead up to obvious wrongdoing (as seen in the present case). 975 Collectively, the “involvement” by utilising a large network of accountholders, TRs, and intermediaries can be applied to various nefarious ends. Indeed, when applied at a scale, as in this case, the ways in which the accused persons were “involved” in the accounts made detection difficult, and this was a mischief which, in my view, ought to be caught by s 201(b). I turned then to the kinds of “involvement”. Where the instructions are given directly to TRs, the difficulty in detection certainly is partially the fault of TRs for accepting such instructions. However, it need not only lie on the FIs’ shoulders to ensure their TRs do not skirt this requirement. Where instructions are given indirectly through an accountholder or other authorised person, this is arguably even more insidious because it cloaks the potential discovery of wrongdoing behind a veneer of legitimacy. The interposition of the accountholder or authorised person does not cure the lack of authorisation. Thus, I found that s 201(b) ought to be extended to prevent the kind of abuse as seen in the present case, ie, to evade detection of illegal activity. The broad charges, as seen here, may be contemplated only where there is an interest in securing transparency between accountholders, account users and FIs, especially where such involvement is an indicium of nominee trading or other unlawful trading activity.976 In sum, although I found that the Deception Charges to be somewhat too broadly drafted, there was sufficient ground to conclude that the scope of s 201(b) of the SFA extended to prohibit the conduct which underpinned the Deception Charges as had been drafted and preferred in this case. That said, if a case in the future involves a straightforward instance of “unauthorised share trading” as seen in the case of Ng Geok Eng, the form of the charge seen in that case should be that which is brought. Preliminary issue 3: Standard of proof to be met by the Prosecution977 The general principles relating to criminal conspiracies has been set out at [161]–[163] above. I highlight the important point that the Prosecution needed to prove the fact of each conspiracy that they alleged. Indeed, when the Prosecution applied to amend their original charges for abetment by conspiracy to charges for criminal conspiracy, they took the position that each new charge concerned a distinct conspiracy, most being distinct in time and all being distinct in content.

978 By adopting this position, the Prosecution took on the onus of proving each individual conspiracy. It was not open to the Prosecution to simply prove a general conspiracy to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares, and, on that basis, assert that the individual conspiracies forming the subject of the Deception Charges had, ipso facto, been proven because those charges pertained to the modus operandi by which the broad conspiracy had been executed. I must emphasise firmly the importance of the Prosecution’s burden in respect of the Deception Charges. 979 During the trial, the evidence brought to light the possibility that there could have been Relevant Accounts which had been hidden from the Second Accused. These included several accounts either belonging to Ms Cheng or under Ms Cheng’s management. To appreciate why these specific accounts were unique, it is useful to repeat the context stated at [775] above.980 The First Accused is a widower. Sometime after the death of his wife, he and the Second Accused entered into a fairly long-running romantic relationship. However, for a spell, the First Accused was also concurrently in a romantic relationship with Ms Cheng. Naturally, this gave rise to tensions between the two women. In rough connection with this love-triangle, the contention arose during the trial that the Second Accused had not been aware of these accounts belonging to or under the management of Ms Cheng. Ms Cheng and the First Accused had, apparently, kept them hidden from the Second Accused. This was supported by Ms Cheng’s own evidence.

981 As I will state at [1096]–[1110] below, I found that the Second Accused did not, in fact, know of the existence of these accounts hidden from her. This conclusion plainly undermined the Prosecution’s case in respect of the Deception Charges relevant to those accounts. After all, it could hardly have been said that the two accused persons conspired to “conceal their involvement in the instruction of orders and trades” in respect of a specific Relevant Account, when one of them was not even aware of the existence of such account. It bears reiterating that conspiracies require agreement, and, given the specificity of the conspiracies which had been alleged by the Deception Charges (see [946] above), for such charges to have been made out, it was essential that the accused persons’ agreement be at least somewhat as specific as the relevant Deception Charge. If such specificity was not required, the Prosecution would have been free, contrary to my observations at [978] above, to convert a large conspiracy into charges and potentially convictions for many sub-conspiracies without any increase in the particularity of their case, or variation in the evidential standard of proof they are required to meet. That could not be correct.982 Yet, in this case, after advancing their primary case that the Second Accused was in fact aware of those allegedly hidden accounts, the Prosecution advanced an alternative argument by which they sought to apply a gloss to the standard of proof they needed to meet. In essence, it was said that the Deception Charges “[did] not require that [the Second Accused] know about [those] accounts specifically”.

DPP Mr Jiang: Su-Ling knew about the accounts. So as a matter of fact, the 2nd accused did know about these accounts that Cheng Jo-Ee had.…In any case, your Honour, and back to my point about how the broader agreement influences the specific agreement in relation to the deception and cheating charges, Quah Su-Ling did not need to know whether or not John Soh had certain accounts which he did not tell her about, whether John Soh was dealing with people, with downlines, she did not need to know all those details because their broad agreement was to manipulate the market. Following from that, they then went to gather as many accounts as they could in furtherance of that common objective, and along the way, as accounts were being brought into the scheme, the other person, because of the contours of their broader agreement, must have taken to have agreed that these accounts would be part and parcel of the scheme, that the FIs in relation to each of these accounts would be separately deceived. That’s why we make clear our case theory, there was a broader agreement but there were specific agreements in relation to each and every account that was used as part of this scheme.983 I rejected this argument. It was inconsistent not only with the Prosecution’s own position as to the distinct character of each conspiracy forming the subject of the Deception Charges, but also the level of specificity found in those charges. Furthermore, such a broad take of the evidence would have, in my view, led to considerable duplication. If such an analysis had been allowed, so long as I had convicted the accused persons of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, it almost automatically followed that they should also have been found to be guilty of the Deception Charges. Given the generality of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, and the contrasting specificity of the Deception Charges, such an analysis would not have been tolerable. Thus, in arriving at my decision in respect of each of the 161 Deception Charges, I considered the specific evidence that was available.Overview of the factual issues to be addressed984 This brings me to the issues which needed to be determined at the end of the trial in order to arrive at a conclusion in respect of the Deception Charges. As summarised at [727] above, I found all but two Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons. These findings substantially overlapped with those I needed to make in order to determine the accused persons’ liability for the Deception Charges. 985 However, they were not wholly concomitant. As my discussion on the standard of proof to be met by the Prosecution shows (see [977]–[983] above), it still needed to be specifically determined whether there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the accused persons had conspired to “conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades” from the FIs in respect of each of the 161 accounts. Grouping of the Accounts for the Deception Charges986 In order to set out my findings in respect of the aforementioned issue in an organised manner, I group the Relevant Accounts which formed the subject of Deception Charges as follows:(a) The first group comprises 106 charges pertaining to Local Accounts, in respect of which the Prosecution alleged that either or both accused persons gave direct instructions to the TR. I have placed accounts in this group so long as such direct instructions was at least one of the means by which the Prosecution alleged the accused persons had given instructions on the account.

(b) The second group comprises six charges pertaining to Local Accounts, but in respect of which the Prosecution did not allege that the accused persons gave direct instructions to the TRs. Instead, the Prosecution’s case in respect of these accounts was that the accused persons’ instructions had been relayed through the accountholder or, in the case of Mr Leroy Lau specifically, given directly to him to place orders. (c) The third and last group includes 49 charges concerning Foreign Accounts. The persons who stood in the equivalent position of TRs, where the Foreign Accounts were concerned, were the trading desks of the foreign FIs, or the individual accounts’ relationship manager. These persons, however, did not feature in the Prosecution’s case. Instead, its case was that either or both of the accused persons gave instructions through the accounts’ intermediaries, who would either use the FI’s online trading platform to place trades, or do so by calling the FI’s trading desk or the account’s relationship manager. This was therefore akin to the mode of control the accused persons exercised over the Local Accounts placed in the second group.987 I set out my findings in respect of each group in turn.Local Accounts: direct instructions988 As a starting point, I found that the accused persons certainly knew that executing trades using another’s account was not permitted. This was evident from the following:(a) The First Accused was an undischarged bankrupt

 and it should have been blatantly obvious to him, particularly given his experience in world of business, that he would not be permitted to instruct trades in another persons’ securities trading account unless expressly permitted both by the accountholder and the FI to do so.(b) As regards the Second Accused, I mentioned at [44] above that Mr Jack Ng gave evidence that, when he had asked her to complete third-party authorisation forms for six Relevant Accounts under his management (in respect of which the second accused was not authorised to instruct trades), she was displeased and threatened to take hers and the Relevant Accountholders’ business to another brokerage. Mr Jack Ng, fearing the loss of her business, did not press the issue.

 989 The accused person’s knowledge of this prohibition was significant and firmly supported the inference of individual conspiracies to deceive the various FIs. After all, it was revealing that, despite knowing of such a prohibition and the steps which had to be taken in order to apply for formal approval, the accused persons were not formally authorised to give trading instructions in respect of any of the Relevant Accounts which formed the subject of the Deception Charges. A general defence: Attribution of knowledge to the TRs990 Before turning to my findings in respect of the Deception Charges within this group, I address the Defence’s argument that the local FIs could not even be said to have been deceived.

 As mentioned at [146] above, on the footing the accused persons were found to have been in control of the Relevant Accounts, the Defence submitted that the knowledge of certain TRs who had been aware of the accused persons’ involvement ought to be attributed to the FIs. Therefore, if the FIs could be said to have possessed such knowledge, they could not have been “deceived”. 991 In greater detail, the Defence’s argument proceeded as follows. On the authority of Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others [2009] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“Ng Giap Hon”) at [7], it was submitted that remisiers are agents of the brokerages by which they are engaged (also see Associated Asian Securities Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Lee Kam Wah [1992] 3 SLR(R) 812 at [13] cited by the Second Accused in her submissions).

 As agents, they were capable of acquiring knowledge which was, in turn, attributable to their principals. As such, if the local FIs in this case could be said to have acquired knowledge through the TRs who had been aware of the accused persons’ involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in the Relevant Accounts, it followed that they could not have been “deceived”.992 In response, the Prosecution made three submissions:

(a) The first was a factual argument that not all TRs for local FIs knew of the accused persons’ involvement in the use of the relevant accounts. For example, in respect of Mr Hong’s OCBC Securities account under the management of Mr Aaron Ong, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused persons had relayed instructions through Mr Hong. Thus, Mr Aaron Ong would not have known about the accused persons’ involvement behind Mr Hong (see [385]–[387] above). Another example was Annica Holdings’ account with Lim & Tan under Mr See. Indeed, in respect of this account, Mr See himself testified that he had only received instructions from Mr Sugiarto.

(b) Second, as a matter of law, the Prosecution submitted that the attribution of an agent’s knowledge to his principal was only possible if the agent was acting within the scope of his actual or ostensible authority. They took the view that TRs did not have the authority to accept instructions from persons without formal written authorisation.

993 Although I accepted the Prosecution’s first submission (this was simply a question of fact), I had some reservations about its second submission. It was not altogether obvious why the conduct of the TRs taking instructions without formal written authorisation from the accountholder, approved by the FI, necessarily went beyond mere breaches of the duties they had owed the FIs, into the realm of depriving them of authority entirely (the consequence of this being that the validity of the trades placed without such formal written authorisation were in want of authority and, therefore, arguably subject to ab initio vitiation).994 The representatives of the FIs testified that they required third-party authorisation to be in writing. They also gave reasons for this.

Rule 12.4.1 required FIs to obtain prior written authorisation from their clients before permitting third parties to give trading instructions on behalf of their clients. Rule 13.6.1 connectedly prohibited TRs from using a client’s account for third-party trading without prior written authorisation from the client. However, the representatives of the FIs did not clearly state that a TR would have been acting outside the scope of his authority by accepting trading instructions from a third party who had verbal but not written authorisation from the accountholder. Further, the TRs’ agency contracts were also not tendered as evidence. Those might have been useful in interpreting the scope of each TR’s authority. The Prosecution also did not clearly argue why the TRs should be found to be acting in want of authority.995 Notwithstanding these reservations, I nevertheless found that TRs, as agents of the brokerages, had no authority to take instructions from third parties who were not properly authorised to give such instructions. I had two main reasons for this view:(a) First, as the FIs were themselves precluded by rule 12.4.1 from accepting instructions from third parties without written authorisation, it seemed odd to conclude that FIs would authorise their TRs to act contrary both to the FI’s own obligations, as well as contrary to the TRs’ obligations under rule 13.6.1. (b) Second, although the SGX Rules technically only stipulated that the accountholder needed to provide his written authorisation to the third party in the form provided by the FI, depending on the terms of the accountholder’s agreement with the FI, this likely required the FI’s approval. The authorisation of a third party was, therefore, not necessarily (and, indeed, not usually) a matter which could be unilaterally effected by the accountholder. This accorded logically with the FIs’ own obligations to ensure they knew their clients and had taken steps to prevent money laundering. Given the unique position of the FIs in this particular context, I found it difficult to conclude that the FIs would have authorised their TRs to act without written authorisation from third parties. Therefore, I found that the TRs acted in want of authority – as opposed to being in mere breach of their duties.996 Alternatively, even if I had erred in characterising the taking of instructions from unauthorised or improperly authorised third parties as a matter infecting the TRs’ authority, my view was that the present case, particularly its criminal context, justified an “extension” of the “Re Hampshire principle” (or, the “fraud exception”) beyond cases of actual fraud to honest breaches of duty by agents. This was a conclusion urged upon the court by the Prosecution.

 Before going any further, I should make four clarifications about the law.997 First, I have placed quotation marks around “extension”, “Re Hampshire principle” and the “fraud exception” because I recognise that these terms are misnomers. The question of whether the knowledge of an agent may be attributed to his principal, is a highly context-specific inquiry. The answer one arrives at depends on whether there exists a principle, rule, or policy to which the court would be giving effect in attributing the agent’s knowledge to the principle in the particular context of the dispute. This was the essence of Lord Hoffmann’s seminal speech in Meridan Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500 (“Meridan Global”) (adopted in The “Dolphina” [2012] 1 SLR 992 at [213]–[249], and affirmed in Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) [2014] 3 SLR 329 at [48]). This view is, of course, also supported by the leading authors in the field, Peter Watts and FMB Reynolds, Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency (Sweet & Maxwell, 22nd Ed, 2021) (“Bowstead”), where they stated at para 8-209(a):… It is always necessary to consider the context of the particular legal issue to which imputation of knowledge might be pertinent. There is no overarching principle that a principal is deemed to know at all times and for all purposes that which an agent knows. In this regard the rules of imputation do not exist in a state of nature, such that some reason has to be found to disapply them. Hence, a principal might be deemed to possess an agent’s knowledge for the purpose of liability to outside parties (or for exposure to regulatory or criminal sanction), but not deemed to know those same facts (let alone have condoned any action by the agent) for the purpose of action by the principal against the agent personally. …998 Second, as attribution necessarily turns on the context in which it is asserted, there is no “fraud exception” per se (equally, there would be no “Re Hampshire principle” or any principle to “extend”) (on this, see the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Bilta (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) and others v Nazir and others (No 2) [2016] AC 1 (“Bilta”) at [9] (per Lord Neuberger), [41]–[45] (per Lord Mance), [181]–[182], [191], [202] and [207] (per Lords Toulson and Hodge). There is no principle, rule, policy, or, indeed, any good sense or logic, which justifies the attribution of a fraudulent agent’s knowledge to his principal, when the action is brought by the principal against the agent in respect of the very fraud in issue. As observed in Bowstead at para 8-209(c), “imputation of knowledge simply does not operate in such circumstances … [n]o exception is therefore necessary”. 999 Third, the circumstances discussed above specifically concern cases in which a fraudulent agent seeks to attribute his own knowledge to his principal in defence of an action brought by his principal against him. In such cases, the lack of any justification supporting attribution is obvious. Indeed, it is also obvious that it should not be confined to actual fraud and should naturally extend to honest breaches of duty. The point is that there is still no sound justification for permitting an agent, in an action brought by his principal against him, to plead his own breaches of duty as a defence. This is a view supported by Bowstead (see para 8-209(c)).1000 Fourth, I was acutely mindful that the present case was nothing like that in Bilta, or, indeed, any of the usual cases where one would see references to Re Hampshire. As suggested, those cases would typically concern disputes between principals and their agents. The present case instead concerns four parties. One, the Prosecution who commenced these criminal proceedings (“Party 1”). Two, the accused persons who were the subject of the proceedings (“Party 2”). Three, the TRs who took trading instructions from third parties who had not been properly authorised (“Party 3”). Four, the FIs whose TRs acted in such manner (“Party 4”). 1001 Unlike the generally more straightforward circumstances of principal-agent disputes, here, Party 2 was seeking to attribute the knowledge of Party 3 to Party 4 for the purposes of a defence against criminal prosecution brought by Party 1. If one were to lose sight of the fact that attribution questions fundamentally need to be answered by reference to the context in which they are argued, such a situation may yield an unduly technical analysis. However, taking a step back from the superficial complexity in the present case, it will be seen that the underlying question which needed to be answered was simply whether attribution of the TRs’ knowledge to the FIs was justified to allow the accused persons the benefit of the fact that the TRs had acted in breach of their duties to their principals. The short and obvious answer was “no”. 1002 As I have stated at [988] above, the accused persons were patently aware of the fact that giving trading instructions to the TRs without being formally authorised was improper. On this note, setting aside the question whether the TRs had lacked the authority to accept instructions from third parties who had not been properly authorised to give such instructions on behalf of accountholders (see [993]–[994] above), it was evident that, should they do so, they would have been acting in breach of their duty to their FI principals. This much was clear from rules 12.4.1 and 13.6.1 of the SGX Rules, as well as the fact that doing so placed the FI at risk of the accountholder having a basis to disavow the trades instructed by the third party. Thus, as the accused persons had been aware of this, there was no principle, rule, or policy which could justify saddling the FIs with the knowledge of the TRs whom the accused persons had themselves induced (or at least partially caused) to act in breach of their duties. Indeed, if I had accepted the First Accused’s attribution defence to the Deception Charges, I would have been permitting attribution for a rather technical reason, divorced from the underlying principles espoused by Lord Hoffmann in Meridan Global.1003 For the avoidance of any doubt, the foregoing conclusion should not be construed as expressing the view that there would not have been any situation in which a TR’s knowledge ought to be attributed to the FIs. I accordingly dismissed the First Accused’s attribution arguments, and I now turn to state my conclusions in respect of whether the Deception Charges were made out against the accused persons.Two accounts under Ms Ang1004 The first subgroup comprised Mr Chen’s two UOB Kay Hian accounts under the management of Ms Ang.

 As stated at [203]–[228] above, I found that these two accounts had been controlled by the accused persons with both of them giving trade instructions. 1005 Accordingly, the two key questions which remained were: (a) whether it could be inferred that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades placed in Mr Chen’s two UOB Kay Hian accounts; and (b) whether the manner in which the accused persons had concealed such involvement was likely to operate as a deception on UOB Kay Hian (ie, whether offences under s 201(b) of the SFA had been completed). 1006 I begin with the former. In my judgment, there was no reasonable doubt that there existed such conspiracies. Three reasons follow.(a) First, given the knowledge the accused persons had possessed (see [988] above), the very fact that they exercised control of the Relevant Accounts in the shadows, so to speak, ie, without even applying for, much less with formal authorisation, was a clear indication of their intention to be concealed from formal scrutiny.(b) Second, as the accounts had been controlled by the accused persons for their broader Scheme, it was clear that the accused persons had understood that their involvement in the use of the individual accounts needed to be concealed from the FIs. After all, if the accused persons had sought formal authorisation from each and every FI as they ought to have, there would have come a point where the FIs would have queried why the accused persons needed to have formal authority over so many trading accounts. Their lack of formal authorisation was precisely that which enabled the Scheme to go undetected for as long as it did.(c) Third, both accused persons had been aware that these two accounts under Ms Ang existed. This is because as stated above, both had given trading instructions for them without being properly authorised to do so. 1007 From these premises, it could be readily inferred that the accused persons had agreed to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in these two accounts. Such an agreement could be inferred because, absent such an agreement, the accused persons’ control of the accounts would have been far more susceptible to discovery and disruption.1008 Next, I turn to the question whether the concealment effected by the accused persons was “likely to operate as a deception” and, if so, whether the substantive offence underlying the Deception Charges had been made out. Where unauthorised instructions are given directly to a TR, an FI’s detection depends on the TR’s conduct, and the FI’s ability to regulate and monitor the conduct of their TRs. However, as the present case revealed, TRs can be incentivised (through the promise and payment of hefty and constant commission) to act against the interests of the FIs. This was, in my view, a rather insidious way for the accused persons to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades and, thus, plainly crossed the threshold of “likely to operate as a deception”. In any event, as set out in [513] above, Ms Choo, the representative for UOB Kay Hian, testified that the FI had not known about the accused persons’ involvement in the instruction of BAL orders and trades in all Relevant Accounts held with it, save for Ms Lim SH’s account (given that the Second Accused had been granted formal authorisation).

 Apart from the attribution argument advanced by the First Accused, which I have rejected, the Defence did not have an answer to the fact that the FIs had not been aware of their involvement. I therefore accepted Ms Choo’s evidence that UOB Kay Hian had been deceived. The accused person’s insidious actions were likely to operate as a deception, and, in fact, the FI had actually been deceived.1009 Therefore, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been conspiracies between the accused persons to deceive UOB Kay Hian by concealing their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in these two accounts. I accordingly convicted them of the two Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 15 and 16). For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that the accused persons had, in my judgment, completed the offences under s 201(b) of the SFA which underpinned the criminal conspiracies forming the subject of those two charges. This had consequences when it came to sentencing.Eight accounts under Mr Alex Chew1010 For the reasons set out at [229]–[255] above, I found that all eight Relevant Accounts held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Alex Chew had been controlled by both accused persons. 1011 Accordingly, my approach towards determining the Deception Charges which related to these eight accounts was essentially the same as that taken in relation to the two accounts under Ms Ang, as set out from [1005]–[1007] above. In particular, the points made at [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] applied equally to these eight accounts. In respect of the point at [1006(c)], it was also the case that both accused persons had been aware of the eight Relevant Accounts under Mr Alex Chew and had given trading instructions for them. Accordingly, taking the evidence in the round, there was enough to infer beyond reasonable doubt conspiracies between the accused persons to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in each of these accounts. Accordingly, I convicted them of the Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 26, 27, 32, 33, 37, 38, 55 and 56).1012 As with the two accounts under Ms Ang (see [1009] above), I was also satisfied in respect of these eight charges that the substantive offences underlying the accused persons’ criminal conspiracies, ie, the offences under s 201(b) of the SFA, had been committed. Mr Wong CW of DMG & Partners also testified that the FI had not been aware of the accused persons’ involvement and, thus, that their deception was ultimately effective (see [513] above). Three accounts under Mr Jordan Chew1013 As explained at [256]–[272] above, I found that the three Relevant Accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Menon and Mr Neo (held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Jordan Chew) had been controlled only by the Second Accused. In particular, I rejected the Prosecution’s case that both accused persons had given trading instructions for Mr Neo’s account (see [272] above). 1014 This being the state of the facts, although my approach for assessing the three Deception Charges to which these accounts related substantially mirrored the analysis set out at [1005]–[1007], my view was that there were two specific questions which ought to be answered. First, whether the First Accused had at least been aware of the existence of these three accounts. Second, whether the First Accused had been aware that the Second Accused had been instructing BAL trades in these accounts without proper authorisation.(a) As regards the first question, different pieces of evidence related to each of the three Relevant Accountholders. In respect of Mr Chen’s account, there was his direct evidence, which I accepted, that all 14 of his accounts had been provided to the First Accused for his use.

 and, thus, the conclusion was straightforward. However, where Mr Menon’s account was concerned, there was nothing which directly and plainly showed that the First Accused had knowledge of the account’s existence. Nonetheless, the fact that he did could readily be inferred from the email reproduced at [288] above as well as his control over Mr Menon’s other Relevant Account held with OCBC Securities under the management of Ms Chua (see [300] above).(b) As regards the second question, the three points in relation to six accounts under Ms Poon which required more extensive discussion at [1038(a)], [1038(b)] and [1038(c)] below applied equally here. For one, these three accounts also traded primarily in LionGold shares, minimally in Asiasons, and even less in Blumont.

1015 Given the foregoing, the inference articulated at [1039] below also naturally arose in respect of these three accounts. Accordingly, there was enough to conclude that the three Deception Charges to which they related had been made out. Thus, I convicted the accused persons of those charges (ie, Charges 22, 67 and 81). Once again, relying on Mr Wong CW’s evidence that the concealment had the effect of deceiving the FI (see [513] and [1012] above), I found that the accused persons had also completed the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these Deception Charges.Five accounts under Ms Chua1016 For the reasons set out at [273]–[300] above, I found the four Relevant Accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi held with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua had been controlled by the First Accused. The account of Mr Menon had been controlled by both the First and Second Accused collectively. 1017 In respect of the former four accounts, as only one of the two accused persons had exercised control over this account, the same analysis deployed above in respect of the three accounts under Mr Jordan Chew applied, and the same two questions posed at [1014] need to be addressed. The first question could be answered in part by reference to the Shareholding Schedule which made reference to Mr Chen and Mr Neo’s accounts.

 Where Mr Tan BK and Mr Billy Ooi were concerned, I found it appropriate to adversely infer that the Second Accused had both known that the accounts existed and that the First Accused had been giving trading instructions to Ms Chua without being properly authorised. This adverse inference was, in my view, justified for the same essential reasons set out at [1055]–[1058] below vis-à-vis the account managed by Mr Yong (where a more detailed discussion is set out). Thus, I found that the Deception Charges relating to these four accounts had been made out and I convicted the accused persons accordingly of those charges (ie, Charges 14, 78, 98 and 114). 1018 As regards Mr Menon’s account, as both accused persons had been directly involved in its control, the approach for determining whether the Deception Charge to which this account related had been made out, was essentially the same as that taken at [1005]–[1007] above. Thus, I convicted the accused persons of the relevant charge (ie, Charge 66) accordingly. 1019 For all these charges, relying on the evidence of Ms Choo (see [513] and [1008] above) that UOB Kay Hian had actually been deceived, I found that the underlying s 201(b) offences had also been completed. Two accounts under Mr Gan1020 As explained at [704]–[715] above, I found that both accused persons had controlled the two Relevant Accounts held with DMG & Partners under Mr Gan’s management – one account of Mr Lim KY and one of Mr Fernandez. 1021 While there were segments of the Relevant Period during which the accused persons had delegated the trading decision-making in respect of these two accounts to Mr Gwee, Mr Tai and Mr Gan himself (see [678]–[682] above), this did not affect the analysis for these two Deception Charges. For the period of the charges, the accused persons still largely exercised personal control over the accounts by giving trading instructions directly to Mr Gan. In any case, the fact of the delegation to Mr Gwee, Mr Tai and Mr Gan did not take these two accounts outside the accused persons’ control given that the delegates exercised their decision-making functions under the auspices of the accused persons’ Scheme. Hence, even though some BAL orders and trades would have been executed in these accounts on directions given by either Mr Gwee, Mr Tai, Mr Gan or any combination of them, that did not detract from the fact that such orders and trades ultimately stemmed from the accused persons. Their “involvement” in that sense was still being concealed from the FI.1022 The two Deception Charges relating to these accounts was therefore subjectable to the same essential analysis stated at several points above in respect of dual-controlled accounts (ie, accounts which had been controlled by both accused persons) (see [1005]–[1007] above). Carrying out the necessary review of the evidence, I was satisfied that the accused persons had conspired to deceive DMG & Partners by concealing their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in these two accounts. According to Mr Wong CW, DMG & Partners did not have any knowledge of their involvement (see [513] and [1012] above). Accordingly, I convicted them of the two Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 91 and 108). For completeness, I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these two charges had been completed.Two accounts under Mr Kam1023 At [301]–[307] above, I explained why I found that both accused persons had exercised control over two Relevant Accounts with AmFraser under the management of Mr Kam – one of Mr Chen and another of Mr Goh HC. 1024 As before, given that my finding was that both accused persons had directly controlled the accounts by giving trading instructions on BAL shares, the approach for assessing whether the Deception Charges relating to these two accounts had been proven, was essentially that taken at [1005]–[1007] above. As I suggested at [1006(a)]and [1006(b)] above, given the existence of their Scheme, the accused persons had good reason to do so conceal their involvement with the accounts from AmFraser.1025 Therefore, I found that the two Deception Charges connected with these accounts were made out and convicted the accused persons of those charges accordingly (ie, Charges 13 and 25). I found the s 201(b) offences underlying these two charges had been carried out based on the fact that the FI had on the evidence of its representative, Mr Tan SK, actually been deceived as to the fact of the accused persons’ involvement (see [513] above).Eight accounts under Mr Andy Lee1026 My findings in respect of the eight Relevant Accounts held with Lim & Tan under the management of Mr Andy Lee are set out at [323]–[330] above. Those eight accounts were held in the names of Mr Chen, Mr Richard Ooi, Mr Ong KL, and Mr Sim CK. Each held two accounts. 1027 Having determined that it was only the Second Accused who had given trading instructions directly to Mr Andy Lee, the same two questions posed at [1014] needed to be addressed. Turning to the first question as to whether the First Accused had been aware of these eight accounts, I note that the Shareholding Schedule kept track of the Lim & Tan accounts of Mr Chen, Mr Ong KL and Mr Sim CK.

 Mr Richard Ooi’s Lim & Tan accounts had not been specifically monitored. However, given my observations at [330] above, there was little doubt that the First Accused had been aware of those accounts’ existence as well.1028 As for the second question, it was also clear that in respect of these eight accounts, the First Accused had been aware that the Second Accused had been instructing trades in them. First, Mr Chen testified that all his accounts had been made available to both accused persons for their use.

 However, as it turned out, the Second Accused not only knew about the existence of these accounts, she had controlled them by giving trading instructions to Mr Andy Lee. This being the state of the facts, it could only be logically inferred that the First Accused had been aware of the Second Accused’s control and use of these six accounts. 1029 On these premises, I found it appropriate to infer that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades from Lim & Tan. Thus, I convicted the accused persons of the relevant Deception Charges to which these eight Lim & Tan accounts related (ie, Charges 17, 18, 138, 139, 143, 144, 166 and 167). Ms Seet gave evidence that Lim & Tan had not been aware of the accused persons’ involvement (see [513] above). I also found that the s 201(b) offences underlying these charges had been completed.Three accounts under Mr Lincoln Lee1030 There were three Relevant Accounts held with Maybank Kim Eng under the management of Mr Lincoln Lee. These were one account of Ms Huang and two of Mr Kuan AM. For the reasons given at [331]–[356] above, I found that both accused persons had given trading instructions for the substantial BAL trades to Mr Lincoln Lee in respect of all three accounts. 1031 Having made this finding, I approached my analysis of the relevant Deception Charges on the same footing as the other accounts in respect of which both accused persons had exercised control (see [1005]–[1007] above). I found that the three Deception Charges to which these accounts related had been made out, and I convicted both accused persons of those charges accordingly (ie, Charges 34, 69 and 70). I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these three charges had been carried out. As set out at [513] above, Mr Kwek for Maybank Kim Eng gave evidence that the FI had not known about the accused persons’ involvement with these accounts, and it could be said that the FI had actually been deceived. Six accounts under Mr Jack Ng1032 As explained at [374]–[384] above, I found that both accused persons had controlled the six Relevant Accounts held with OCBC Securities under Mr Jack Ng’s management. This comprised one held in Mr Goh HC’s name, two of Ms Ng SL, one of Mr Kuan AM, and two of Ms Lim SH. Adopting the same essential analysis stated at multiple points above for dual-controlled accounts (ie, accounts which had been controlled by both accused persons) (see [1005]–[1007] above), and carrying out the necessary review of the evidence, I was satisfied that the accused persons had conspired to deceive OCBC Securities by concealing their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in these six accounts. Accordingly, I convicted them of the six Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 30, 64, 65, 68, 154 and 155). For completeness, I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these six charges had been completed. As stated at [513] above, according to Mr Woon, OCBC Securities was not aware of the accused persons’ role in these accounts.Three accounts under Mr Ong KC1033 Mr Ong KC managed three Relevant Accounts held with Maybank Kim Eng, one each in the name of Mr Chen, Magnus Energy, a company which had been controlled by Mr Lim KY, and Mr Tan BK. For the reasons set out at [388]–[398] above, I found that the First Accused had controlled all three accounts by giving direct trading instructions to Mr Ong KC or, when he was not available, to his covering officer, Mr Lim TL.1034 Given my finding that only the First Accused had been involved in the direct control of these accounts, I needed to determine whether the Second Accused was apprised of the existence of these accounts and, further, whether she was aware that he had been instructing BAL trades in them without proper authorisation (see [1014] above). In respect of the former question, Mr Chen and Mr Tan BK’s accounts featured in the Shareholding Schedule,

 1035 Notwithstanding the First Accused’s evidence, given the Second Accused’s election, there was a gap in the evidence as to her knowledge. As with the four accounts discussed at [1017] above, I found it appropriate to adversely infer that the Second Accused had known about the existence of Magnus Energy’s account, and known that the First Accused had been giving trading instructions to Mr Ong KC in respect of all three accounts without being properly authorised. This adverse inference was, in my view, justified for the same reasons set out at [1055]–[1058] below vis-à-vis the account managed by Mr Yong. There was also some objective factual basis in support of the inference. Whilst the Shareholding Schedule did not specifically reflect Magnus Energy’s account with Maybank Kim Eng, it did record the company’s shareholdings in other places, such as its CDP account generally.

 Accordingly, with this adverse inference, I found that the Deception Charges relating to these three accounts had been proven and I accordingly convicted the accused persons of those charges (ie, Charges 21, 49 and 101). I also found that the s 201(b) offences underlying these Deception Charges had been completed as Mr Kwek for Maybank Kim Eng gave evidence that the FI had not known about the First Accused’s involvement with these accounts, it could also have been said that the FI had actually been deceived (see [513] above).Six accounts under Ms Poon1036 For the reasons set out at [399]–[408] above, I found that the six Relevant Accounts of Dato Idris, Mr Sim CK, Ms Chong, Mr Lee SK, Ms Hairani, and Mr Ngu – held with OCBC Securities under the management of Ms Poon – had been controlled only by the Second Accused. 1037 As would have been gathered from my approach in relation to the three accounts under Mr Jordan Chew (see [1013]–[1015] above), though my analysis for these six accounts followed much the same structure as that stated at [1005]–[1007] above, there were still two specific questions which needed to be answered. On the question whether the First Accused had been aware of the existence of these accounts, I note that all six of these accounts appeared in the Shareholding Schedule.

 In fact, a position the First Accused took in support of the Defence’s broader case that the Second Accused had not controlled these six accounts was that she would not even have known about these “old accounts”, conversely suggesting that he had known of the existence of these accounts.

 This was the finding I reached. 1038 I turn to the question whether the First Accused had been aware that the Second Accused had been instructing BAL trades in these accounts without proper authorisation. In reaching this conclusion that he was aware of this, I took into account the following three points:(a) First, as I stated at [730]–[735] above, there was evidence that the accused persons had taken steps to gather as many trading accounts as they could in furtherance of their Scheme. That being the case, it could be surmised that, if the First Accused had known of the existence of “friendly accounts” (a term I borrow from Mr Wong XY: see [449] above) in which BAL trades could be placed, he would have taken steps to secure the ability to use that account. If the First Accused did not do so, as was the case here, it was highly likely that he did not because the usage of these accounts was already being handled by someone else – ie, the Second Accused. (b) Second, the fact that only the Second Accused had been directly involved in the instructing of orders and trades in these accounts also made sense in the broader context. These accounts traded predominantly in LionGold shares, only a little in Asiasons, and essentially not at all in Blumont.

 The evidence showed that the Second Accused was generally the one who had given TRs trading instructions for LionGold (see, eg, [338(c)] above).(c) Third, when filtered, the SGX trading data for LionGold showed that these six accounts – for the entire Relevant Period – very frequently traded against other Relevant Accounts, including those which I found to have been under the First Accused’s direct control.

 it could be concluded that at least some of the trades executed between these six accounts and other Relevant Accounts would have been wash trades synchronised by both the Second and First Accused. 1039 Given that the foregoing question was answered in the affirmative, the natural inference which followed was that the accused persons had impliedly agreed to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades from OCBC Securities. I convicted them of those six Deception Charges accordingly (ie, Charges 165, 168, 169, 170, 171 and 172).1040 Once again, based on Mr Woon’s evidence (see [513] above), I found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these six Deception Charges had been completed. Two accounts under Mr Tiong1041 As stated at [428]–[443] above, my finding in respect of the two Relevant Accounts of Mr Richard Ooi held with Phillip Securities under the management of Mr Tiong, was that the Second Accused had exercised control over them by giving direct trading instructions to Mr Tiong. 1042 Thus, as with the accounts under Ms Poon just discussed, there was a need to determine if the First Accused had been aware of the existence of Mr Richard Ooi’s two accounts and, further, if he had also known that the Second Accused had been giving trading instructions for the accounts (see [1014] above). The answer to both questions was straightforwardly “yes”. As stated, the meeting referred to at [438(g)] above only made sense if two accounts of Mr Richard Ooi had been controlled accounts and, further, that the First Accused had known of their existence. Furthermore, consistent with what I said at [1014(b)] and [1038(b)], the two accounts of Mr Richard Ooi also traded principally in LionGold, and not in Blumont or Asiasons.

 The fact that the Second Accused had exercised control over these two accounts without the First Accused being directly involved in the sense of him also instructing Mr Tiong, thus made sense. It was certainly not the case that the Second Accused had been controlling these accounts purely on a frolic of her own. 1043 Therefore, for the same reasons set out at [1039] above, I found that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in Mr Richard Ooi’s two accounts from Phillip Securities. Accordingly, I convicted them of the Deception Charges relevant to those accounts (ie, Charges 140 and 141). I also found that the s 201(b) offences underlying these two charges had been completed. Ms Goh CG testified on behalf of Phillip Securities at the trial and her evidence was also that the FI had not known about the Second Accused’s involvement with the accounts (see [513] above).Twenty-seven accounts under Mr Tjoa1044 There were 27 Relevant Accounts held with Phillip Securities under the management of Mr Tjoa. These accounts have been listed out at [716] above, and the accused persons faced a Deception Charge for their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in each of these accounts.1045 For the reasons given at [717]–[726] above, I found that both accused persons had given trading instructions to Mr Tjoa in respect of all 27 accounts. Such trading instructions had been given in a variety of ways: (a) directly to Mr Tjoa; (b) relayed to Mr Tjoa through Mr Tai; (c) by Mr Gwee, Mr Tai and Mr Gan as delegates of the accused persons acting within their Scheme; and (c) relayed to Mr Tjoa through the accountholder or authorised signatory (this was only the Prosecution’s case in respect of Mr Goh HC, Mr Hong, Mr Sugiarto and G1 Investments’ accounts).

1046 Given my observations on delegation at [1021] above, and my findings that both accused persons had been involved in the instructing of orders and trades, I approached my analysis of the 27 relevant Deception Charges on the same footing as the other accounts in respect of which both accused persons had exercised control (see [1005]–[1007] above). Namely, I took into account the points made at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above. Having done so and conducted a review of the evidence, I was satisfied that all accounts had been used frequently to trade in BAL. This showed in the statements for each account,

 Seen alongside the accused persons’ control of the accounts, these facts were certainly sufficient to give rise to an inference that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades from Phillip Securities. No other inference was logical in the face of such informal and extensive control, especially against the backdrop of the broader Scheme I found to have existed (see [889]–[894] above). Accordingly, I found that the 27 Deception Charges pertaining to the accounts under Mr Tjoa had been made out and convicted them accordingly (ie, Charges 19, 20, 28, 29, 39, 40, 46, 50, 52, 53, 54, 63, 79, 80, 89, 90, 99, 100, 107, 115, 116, 124, 125, 126, 134, 136 and 164).1047 As regards whether the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these 27 Deception Charges had also been completed, however, it was necessary to consider the Defence’s “wilful blindness” argument. From January 2013 until the Crash, Mr Tjoa was calculated to have had earned around S$2.29 million in commissions across all the accounts under his management (not just the Relevant Accounts), trading in all counters (not just in BAL).

 coupled with Mr Goh CG’s evidence that Phillip Securities had knowingly received payments from Mr Jumaat on behalf of several Relevant Accountholders without indication that Mr Jumaat had been authorised to make such payments, Mr Sreenivasan advanced the suggestion that the FI had not been deceived.

 as her evidence was that the FI had been so deceived (see [513] above). 1048 While I understood Mr Sreenivasan’s angle of attack, it bears reiterating that the Deception Charges did not require the FIs to have been deceived. It was sufficient for the accused persons to have engaged in a practice “likely to operate as a deception”. The way in which they involved themselves in the instructing of BAL orders and trades in the 27 accounts under Mr Tjoa’s management certainly met this threshold and, thus, I found that the substantive offences underlying each of the 27 Deception Charges had also been completed. 1049 In any event, I did not think that the factual bases on which Mr Sreenivasan’s argument had been advanced were sufficient to support the conclusion that Phillip Securities had been wilfully blind to the fact of the accused persons’ involvement with the accounts. Although the FI could probably have imposed stricter controls on individuals permitted to deliver payment on behalf of accountholders, there were many inferential steps between the mere fact of Mr Jumaat acting as a courier, and the fact of the accused persons’ background involvement in instructing BAL orders and trades. Wilful blindness as to the latter could not, in my view, be surmised from a mere failure to look more closely into the fact of the former. Twenty-seven accounts under Mr Wong XY1050 The 27 Relevant Accounts held with AmFraser under the management of Mr Wong XY are listed out at [445] above. For the reasons given at [444]–[478] above, I found that both accused persons had exercised control over these 27 accounts by giving trading instructions directly to Mr Wong XY. 1051 As such, my analysis of the relevant Deception Charges was undertaken on the same footing as the other accounts in respect of which both accused persons had exercised control (see [1005]–[1007] above). Specifically, I took into account the points made at [988]–[989], [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above.1052 Thus, I found that the 27 Deception Charges to which these accounts related had been made out and convicted both accused persons of those charges accordingly (ie, Charges 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 88, 97, 105, 106, 112, 113, 123, 129, 131, 132, 146, 147, 149, 150, 151 and 152). I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these charges had been carried out, and, again, the basis of this finding was the same as that stated at [1025] above, in relation to Mr Kam, also a TR for AmFraser.Account under Mr Yong1053 There was only one Relevant Account held with DBS Vickers under Mr Yong’s management, that of Advance Assets which was a company under Mr Sugiarto’s control. For the reasons given at [479]–[493] above, I was assured in drawing the inference that the First Accused had controlled this account by giving Mr Yong direct trading instructions. There was no evidence that the Second Accused had been directly involved in instructing Mr Yong. 1054 As only one of the two accused persons had exercised control over this account, the same analysis deployed at [1014] above in respect of the three accounts under Mr Jordan Chew applied equally here. 1055 On the question whether the Second Accused had at least been aware of the existence of this account, the fact that the account had been monitored in the Shareholding Schedule plainly supported the conclusion that the Second Accused had known of its existence.

 In respect of the second question whether the Second Accused had been aware of the First Accused’s use of the account without proper authorisation, I found it appropriate, in view of the Second Accused’s election to remain silent, to draw an adverse inference that she had not only known of the existence of this account belonging to Mr Sugiarto but also that the First Accused had been giving Mr Yong BAL trading instructions in respect thereof. Whether the Second Accused had or had not known about the existence of specific accounts and, indeed, how those accounts had been used, were matters “peculiarly within their knowledge” (Oh Laye Koh at [14]). Thus, an adverse inference could rightly be drawn in respect of this type of fact. However, as regards whether such an inference was justified in the circumstances, I took the view that it was.1056 The Prosecution made clear early in the trial that its case in respect of this account was that only the First Accused had given trading instructions to Mr Yong.

 Answering the Deception Charge in respect thereof necessarily required the Second Accused to explain her knowledge of or involvement with this account, especially since the Prosecution had itself taken the position – upon the amendment of the charges – that each of the conspiracies alleged by the Deception Charges were distinct in time and content.

  Prosecution’s Reply Submissions for the Amendment of Charges (22 Jul 2019) at para 17.



 1057 While the Second Accused was entitled to elect not to give evidence, the consequent gaps in the evidence – gaps which only she could fill – were logically construed against her, particularly given that the substantial evidence adduced by the Prosecution called for many issues to be answered. 1058 Having adversely inferred that the Second Accused was aware that Advance Assets’ DBS Vickers was being used by the First Accused without formal authorisation, it could also naturally be inferred that the accused persons had impliedly agreed that the First Accused would do so whilst keeping himself concealed from the FI. This, in my judgment, followed logically from the points made at [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above, and, thus, the Deception Charge to which this account related had been made out. Accordingly, I convicted the accused persons of that charge (ie, Charge 59). The evidence also supported the conclusion that the First Accused had in fact instructed Mr Yong (see in particular, [481]–[482], [486] and [490]–[491]) without being properly authorised to do so. Therefore, it followed that the s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed. Not only was the First Accused’s conduct “likely to operate as a deception”, Mr Sim HK testified on behalf of DBS Vickers that the FI had not been aware of the First Accused’s involvement, and that the FI could also be said to have been actually deceived (see [513] above). Account under Ms Yu1059 The final account in this group was that of Mr Sugiarto held with CIMB under the management of Ms Yu. As stated at [494]–[507] above, I found that both accused persons had exercised control over this Relevant Account, though the Second Accused had not given trading instructions to Ms Yu. Her part in the exercise of control over the account concerned the settlement of contra losses suffered therein (see [498]–[500] above). 1060 For the purposes of this Deception Charge, however, the fact that the Second Accused had not directly given Ms Yu trading instructions was irrelevant. The important points were that both she and the First Accused had controlled the account, and had been aware of the account’s existence and its activities. Therefore, whether the Deception Charge relating to this account had been made out was subject essentially to the analysis set out from [1005]–[1007] above in relation to the accounts under Ms Ang. 1061 On my review of the evidence, I was satisfied that the account had been used relatively frequently to carry out contra trades in BAL. Read alongside the accused persons’ control of the account, I found that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades from CIMB. Accordingly, I convicted the accused persons of the relevant Deception Charge (ie, Charge 57) accordingly.1062 Once again, the s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had certainly been completed. Mr Voo for CIMB testified that the FI was not aware of the accused persons involvement (see [513] above). The deception could therefore also have been said to have been effective, more than just “likely”.Local Accounts: no direct instructions1063 Before turning to my findings, I should make a note about the distinction between the Relevant Accounts grouped under the present heading, “Local Accounts; no direct instructions”, and those grouped under the earlier heading, “Local Accounts; direct instructions” (see [990] above). 1064 Although the mischief underlying both direct and indirect cases was the same, it was useful to separate them into two groups to emphasise that they were to be treated as two distinct classes of cases, and to avoid any impression that it was sufficient for the purposes of establishing an offence under s 201(b) merely to be indirectly “involved” – in a loose sense – in the instructing of an order in someone else’s trading account. After all, whilst most direct “involvement” cases would likely amount to unauthorised trading as articulated in Ng Geok Eng, indirect “involvement” cases could cast the net far beyond that (eg, in cases where the accountholder receives advice). Hence, though the factual analysis required in respect of indirect cases did not necessarily differ from that needed in direct cases, it was important to note that the analysis applied in indirect cases needed to ensure that the net was not too widely cast. 1065 Beyond the more general point, the distinction between direct and indirect cases also affected the applicable scope of the attribution defence raised by the First Accused in this case. Preliminary note: Inapplicability of the attribution defence 1066 The attribution defence raised by the accused persons and discussed at [990]–[1003] above could not be applied to the Deception Charges relating to either Local Accounts in respect of which the accused persons had not given instructions directly to the TR, or to Foreign Accounts.1067 Where the Local Accounts were concerned, the reason for this inapplicability was obvious. The TRs of the FIs simply did not know about the accused persons’ involvement and so there was no knowledge to be attributed to the FI even if there ought, conceptually, to be attribution. The reason the defence was not applicable to the Foreign Accounts was slightly different. In respect of Foreign Accounts, the accused persons were simply not said to have given trading instructions directly to persons whose knowledge could, in turn, potentially be attributed to the foreign FIs. For example, Mr Kam – a “commissioned dealer”

 – was an agent of AmFraser (Ng Giap Hon at [7]) and, thus, there was at least basis to ask whether his knowledge ought to be attributed to brokerage. By contrast, Mr Tai was plainly not in a position to receive information on behalf of Saxo. On the contrary, in the standard form by which his company, Algo Capital had been appointed the “Introducing Broker” for the various Relevant Accountholders, it was expressly stated that the Introducing Broker was an “independent entity” and, accordingly, “not authorised to make any representations concerning [Saxo] or [its] services”.

 In fact, as the holder of a limited power of attorney to effect trades on behalf of the accountholders, Algo Capital was arguably more properly regarded as their agent. The character of Mr Tai’s position vis-à-vis Saxo was the same as it was in relation to IB, and the same characterisation also applied to Mr Phuah vis-à-vis RBC, Ms Cheng vis-à-vis Crédit Industriel, Credit Suisse, SocGen and UBS, and Mr William Chan vis-à-vis Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs.Three accounts belonging to Mr Hong and G1 Investments1068 This group included three Relevant Accounts:

 (a) Mr Hong’s account with OCBC Securities under the management of Mr Aaron Ong; (b) Mr Hong’s account with CIMB under the management of Ms Jenny Lim; and (c) G1 Investments’ account with OCBC Securities, also under the management of Mr Aaron Ong. 1069 As stated at [357]–[364] and [385]–[387] above, I found these accounts had been controlled by the accused persons. Specifically, both accused persons relied on Mr Hong to relay trading instructions to Mr Aaron Ong and Ms Jenny Lim. Given the involvement of both accused persons vis-à-vis these three accounts, my analysis of the relevant Deception Charges essentially mirrored that undertaken in respect of the other Relevant Accounts which the Prosecution alleged that both accused persons had exercised direct control (eg, see [1005]–[1007] in relation to the accounts under Ms Ang). 1070 I was satisfied, upon my review of the evidence and upon taking into account the relevant considerations (particularly those set out at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)]and [1006(b)] above), that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in these three accounts. In particular, I highlight my findings at [359] and [387] above that the nature of communications with Mr Hong were plainly instructions and not, as both he and the First Accused sought to suggest, “trading advice”. Thus, the concerns I expressed at [1063] were not engaged. Accordingly, I convicted the accused persons of the three Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 35, 36 and 47). 1071 It is meaningful to note that the manner in which the accused persons had concealed their involvement in respect of these three accounts (ie, by giving indirect instructions through Mr Hong) was arguably more insidious than in cases involving direct instructions to the TRs. Thus, this practice was certainly “likely to operate as a deception” on OCBC Securities and CIMB which, in any event, I found had actually been deceived based on the evidence of their representatives (see [513] above). I should also add that this observation applies equally to the way in which the accused persons had controlled the Foreign Accounts managed by Mr Tai, Mr Phuah, Mr William Chan and Ms Cheng given that their instructions similarly flowed through an authorised individual (see from [1082] below).Account belonging to Annica Holdings under Mr See1072 As explained from [409]–[419] above, I found that both accused persons had indirectly controlled Annica Holdings’ account with Lim & Tan under the management of Mr See, by relaying BAL trading instructions through Mr Sugiarto who would, in turn, instruct Mr See.

  In the oral judgment I handed down on 5 May 2021, I erroneously stated in my discussion of this Deception Charge that only the First Accused had relayed instructions through Mr Sugiarto (see Oral Judgment at [400]). This was despite my earlier broader finding that the account was within both accused persons’ control (see Oral Judgment at [181]). This error, however, does not affect my decision. Indeed, by approaching my analysis of the Deception Charge on the basis that only the First Accused had relayed instructions, and that the Second Accused had not been involved in the relaying of such instructions, I additionally considered whether she had been aware of the existence of the account. This would not have been necessary if I had correctly proceeded on my finding that both accused persons had relayed instructions to Mr See through Mr Sugiarto.



 1073 Accordingly, the analysis I undertook followed the same approach as that stated at [1005]–[1007] above. In carrying out such analysis, I was mindful that the evidence available in respect of this account was not quite so clear cut as that in respect of Mr Hong and G1 Investments’ accounts discussed at [1070] above. Most notably, there were no text message records between the accused persons and Mr Sugiarto which could be considered firsthand. However, the Relaying Analysis, in my view, carried enough weigh to reach the same conclusion. The examples set out at [414], in my view, established a clear and consistent pattern of communication and orders. On the evidence and arguments before me, the best explanation for this pattern was that the accused persons had been conveying instructions to Mr Sugiarto in order for him to relay on to Mr See. As there were a sizeable number of ‘hits’ in the Relaying Analysis (see [415]–[417] above), and those relayed instructions essentially spanned the entire Relevant Period, I found that there was sufficient evidence to infer a conspiracy between the accused persons to conceal their involvement in the instruction of orders and trades in this account from Lim & Tan. Thus, I convicted them of the Deception Charge which related to this charge accordingly (ie, Charge 62). And, for the same reasons set out at [1071] above (note that as set out at [513] above, as with the other FIs, Ms Seet similarly testified on behalf of Lim & Tan and stated that the FI had not been aware of the accused persons’ involvement in the use of this account), I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed.Account belonging to Ms Cheng1074 This subgroup comprised just one Relevant Account – that belonging to Ms Cheng, held with CIMB. It formed the subject of Charge 157. As stated at [420]–[427] above, I was not satisfied that the accused persons had exercised control over this account. Furthermore, there was essentially no evidence that they had even been vaguely involved in any of the orders or trades placed in this account. As such, there was simply no basis to infer that the accused persons had conspired to conceal from CIMB their “involvement … in the instructing of orders and trades” placed in this account. While it is trite that a conspiracy can manifest without completed acts or even preparatory steps, there still needs to be a factual basis from which the conspiracy can be inferred. Absent any loose “involvement”, much less “control”, there was no other factual basis from which a conspiracy could have been inferred. Accordingly, I acquitted the accused persons of Charge 157.Account belonging to Mr Leroy Lau1075 For the reasons set out at [308]–[322] above, I found that both accused persons had exercised control over Mr Leroy Lau’s account with DMG & Partners. The character of such control, however, was different from that which had been exercised over other Relevant Accounts. Specifically, while the accused persons sometimes gave Mr Leroy Lau specific trading instructions as they did other TRs, intermediaries and even accountholders, they also instructed him to conduct trades at his discretion, subject to their general instructions, mandate, or trading objectives. This difference merits some attention.1076 While I had some general concerns about the Prosecution’s choice of the broad word “involved”, and the absence of an allegation pertaining to beneficial ownership in what they claimed were charges for “unauthorised share trading” premised on Ng Geok Eng, I have already dealt with those concerns at [958]–[976] above. Having concluded that the Deception Charges preferred by the Prosecution disclosed an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA, the only question which remained in respect of Mr Leroy Lau’s slight outlier of an account was whether the fact that he largely received general instructions ought to affect that conclusion. Put simply, the question was whether the Prosecution’s formulation of control in relation to Mr Leroy Lau was problematic in so far as the Deception Charge pertaining to his account was concerned.1077 The answer was “no”. If the accused persons had been controlling Mr Leroy Lau’s account, it mattered not whether they had specifically told him, “Buy X shares at S$Y now”, or whether they had more generally said, “We are rolling shares, we need you to pick them up”. Bearing in mind that the mischief of concern was the unauthorised nature of the accused persons’ exercise of control, the latter instruction was plainly as mischievous as the former, if not more so, given that it sought to deal with multiple unauthorised transactions at the same time. Accordingly, on the footing that the accused persons had in fact given Mr Leroy Lau such general instructions, their conduct would have made out an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA on the terms of the Deception Charge preferred. 1078 To elaborate, Mr Leroy Lau gave evidence that he had received general instructions from the accused persons to: (a) artificially maintain the liquidity of BAL shares; and (b) keep its price stable and gradually increasing over time (see [310] and [865] above). In an effort to undermine this, the First Accused averred that Mr Leroy Lau had engaged in short-selling of BAL, which was inconsistent with the alleged general instructions given to him.

 In turn, this supported the conclusion that the accused persons had either never instructed Mr Leroy Lau as he claimed or, even if they had, that he would not have been acting on those instructions when he traded. Another means by which the First Accused sought to generate ambiguity as regards whether Mr Leroy Lau had been acting on his own part or whether he had been acting on general instructions given to him by the accused persons, was by the claim that Mr Leroy Lau had been a “market maker”.

 If Mr Leroy Lau had been a market maker, the pattern of his trading activities in BAL could also be understood in that context, wholly separate from and unrelated to the activities of the accused persons. 1079 As a start, it was slightly odd for the Defence to say, in the same breath, that Mr Leroy Lau had been a “professional market maker”

 The positions were at least slightly contradictory. Nevertheless, putting that aside, the overarching difficulty I had with the Defence’s characterisation of Mr Leroy Lau’s role was that, even if I accepted that he had been short-selling BAL shares (but, for the avoidance of doubt, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that this claim was not one borne out on a closer look at the evidence),

 and had been a market maker therefor, neither point accounted for the objective communications records which plainly showed that there was more to their relationship with Mr Leroy Lau (see, in particular, [314] above).

 Whatever opposing explanation the Defence had for Mr Leroy Lau’s role needed to account for these objective pieces of evidence. However, nothing advanced by the Defence meaningfully did so. And, as against that objective background, it was only Mr Leroy Lau’s testimony – that he had been acting on the accused persons’ general instructions to artificially maintain the liquidity of BAL shares and gradually increase their prices – that made sense.1080 Accordingly, the clear picture which arose from the evidence before me was that Mr Leroy Lau had acted on both accused persons’ general instructions, or in accordance with their general objectives. There were even instances that he had acted on their specific instructions to purchase particular shares (see, eg, [314(d)] above). 1081 As these instructions had been given to Mr Leroy Lau (a) without proper authorisation from DMG & Partners, (b) across a sizeable portion of the Relevant Period, and (c) in the context of the points made at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] ] and [1006(b)] above, the conclusion which naturally followed was that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in his account from the FI. Thus, the Deception Charge relating to his account had been made out and I convicted the accused persons of that charge accordingly (ie, Charge 163). I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed.Foreign Accounts: direct instructionsTwenty-nine accounts managed by the Algo Companies1082 For the reasons set out at [688]–[703] above, I found that all 29 Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and IB under the management of Mr Tai as an authorised intermediary, had been controlled by both accused persons. The manner in which the accused persons had exercised such control was the same in respect of all 29 accounts – they gave trading instructions directly to Mr Tai, and, for a segment of the Relevant Period, they also delegated trading decision-making for these accounts to Mr Gwee, Mr Tai himself, as well as Mr Gan.

 1083 As with my analysis of the accounts under Mr Tjoa (see [1046] above), I approached my analysis of the 29 Deception Charges to which these Relevant Accounts related on the same footing as the other accounts in respect of which both accused persons had exercised control (see [1005]–[1007] above). Namely, I took into account the points made at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above. Coupled with the fact that: (a) these accounts had been used very actively to trade in BAL shares;

 there was, in my view, ample evidence from which it could be inferred that the accused persons had conspired to conceal their involvement in the instructing of BAL orders and trades in each of these 29 accounts from Saxo and IB (as relevant). 1084 I thus found that the 29 Deception Charges to which these accounts related had been made out and convicted both accused persons of those charges accordingly (ie, Charges 23, 24, 48, 51, 58, 60, 61, 72, 82, 84, 85, 92, 102, 103, 104, 109, 111, 117, 119, 127, 128, 130, 133, 135, 137, 142, 145, 148 and 156). I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offences underlying these 29 charges had been carried out.Three accounts managed by Infiniti Asset1085 For the reasons given at [542]–[568] above, I found that the three RBC accounts of Mr Hong, Mr Neo and Mr Fernandez, managed by Infiniti Asset, had been under the control of both accused persons. As such, the analysis which I needed to undertake in assessing whether the Deception Charges to which these three accounts related had been made out was essentially that stated at [1005]–[1007] above.1086 Upon my review of the evidence, and upon taking into account the relevant considerations (especially my observations set out at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] and [1006(b)]), I found that there was enough to infer conspiracies entered between the accused persons to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in those accounts. In particular, I refer to the evidence I discussed from [544]–[555] and [567] above which make clear the great extent to which the accused persons had been involved in not just using these three accounts, but also in their initial establishment. For these reasons, I found that the three Deception Charges to which these accounts related had been made out and I convicted the accused persons of those charges accordingly (ie, Charges 43, 83 and 110). Moreover, for the same reasons set out at [1071], I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed. On this, it bears highlighting that the representative for RBC, Ms Seah, gave evidence that the FI had not been aware of both accused persons’ involvement with the accounts.

 (b) Mr Billy Ooi’s account with Credit Suisse; and (c) Mr Hong’s account with Goldman Sachs. 1088 For the reasons given at [569]–[598] above, I found that: (i) Mr Hong’s account with Credit Suisse had been controlled by both accused persons (the Second Accused had instructed Mr William Chan directly but the First Accused had relayed instructions to him through Mr Nicholas Ng as well as Mr Hong: see, specifically, [588]); and (ii) both Mr Billy Ooi’s account with Credit Suisse as well as Mr Hong’s account with Goldman Sachs had been controlled by the Second Accused only (see, specifically, [592] and [598]). 1089 Given these findings, the analysis in respect of the first account was essentially mirrored that undertaken at [1005]–[1007] above. I found that there was enough to infer a conspiracy entered between the accused persons to conceal their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in this account. For these reasons, I found that the Deception Charge to which Mr Hong’s Credit Suisse account related had been made out and I convicted the accused persons of that charge accordingly (ie, Charge 44). And, for the same reasons set out at [1071] above, I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed.1090 In respect of the latter two accounts, the specific questions of whether the First Accused had known of the accounts’ existence as well as the Second Accused’s use of the accounts needed to be answered (see [1014] above).1091 I begin with Mr Billy Ooi’s account with Credit Suisse. As stated at [589] above, there was evidence from which it could be inferred that the First Accused had been involved in procuring the initial collateral placed in this account. He was therefore plainly aware of the existence of the account. As regards whether he had known about the Second Accused’s instruction of orders and trades in the account without being properly authorised, – the message from Mr William Chan to Mr Nicholas Ng reproduced at [590] made it extremely clear that he did. Thus, there was ample factual basis (also taking into consideration my observations at [988]–[989], [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above) to infer a specific conspiracy between the accused persons to conceal the Second Accused’s involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in Mr Billy Ooi’s account from Credit Suisse. Accordingly, I convicted the accused persons of the Deception Charge to which this account related (ie, Charge 118). And, for completeness, I note that, for the same reasons set out at [1071] above, I additionally concluded that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had been completed.

1092 Turning to Mr Hong’s account with Goldman Sachs, as stated at [594] above, the First Accused similarly made arrangements for the initial collateral required for this account to be deposited therein. Indeed, that the First Accused had done so was directly admitted by Mr Hong. Thus, the First Accused plainly knew the account existed. As to whether he had been aware of the fact that the Second Accused had been giving trading instructions to Mr William Chan without being properly authorised to do so (see [596]–[598] above), there was nothing which directly revealed his knowledge in this regard as that set out at [590] vis-à-vis Mr Billy Ooi’s Credit Suisse account. However, the fact that the First Accused had been the one who secured the collateral that had been pledged to Goldman Sachs made that conclusion quite inescapable. It would be wholly artificial to suppose that, after the First Accused had made arrangements for collateral to be deposited in the account, he then completely ignored its use. Thus, in my view, there was enough evidence to infer the existence of a specific conspiracy between the accused persons to conceal the Second Accused’s involvement in the instructing of orders and trades from Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, I convicted the accused persons of the Deception Charge to which this account related (ie, Charge 45). As with the account above, I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this charge had been completed.

 Ms Cheng’s one personal and four corporate accounts1093 I begin with Ms Cheng’s personal account with Credit Suisse. As I stated from [614]–[616] above, this account had not been controlled by the accused persons. It axiomatically followed that they had not been involved in the instructing of BAL orders entered therein and, thus, I acquitted them of the Deception Charge relating to this Relevant Account (ie, Charge 158).1094 Next, I deal with the account of Alethia Capital with Credit Suisse. I found, albeit barely (see [610] above), that the accused persons had been in control of this account. That being said, the specific instance on which I relied in finding that they had controlled the account concerned both accused persons, and I was satisfied that they were both apprised not only of the existence of this account, but the fact that it had been used by Ms Cheng upon their instructions to place an order for 500,000 LionGold shares (see [608]–[610] above). Having regard to the points I made at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] and [1006(b)], I found that the accused persons did conspire to deceive Credit Suisse by concealing their involvement in the instructing of an order in this account. I therefore convicted them of the Deception Charge to which this account related (ie, Charge 159). 1095 Indeed, the fact the accused persons’ control could be linked to a specific order for the purchase of LionGold shares also meant that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this Deception Charge had also been completed – that was, they had actually managed to conceal their involvement from Credit Suisse

 and had not merely conspired to do so. However, seeing as how there was only one such identified order – which was also the only order that supported the conclusion of control in the first place – it should go without saying that, notwithstanding my decision to convict the accused persons of this Deception Charge, the gravity of wrongdoing in respect of the charge was obviously less severe than that in respect of accounts which the accused persons had more actively controlled and used. 1096 Lastly, I deal with the three Alethia Elite accounts with UBS and Coutts as a group. As explained from [601]–[606], my finding in respect of these three accounts was that only the First Accused had exercised control over this account. Thus, as stated at [1014] above, it needed to be determined whether the Second Accused had known of the existence of the accounts as well as the fact that they had been used by the First Accused without proper authorisation, likely in connection with their Scheme. 1097 Upon my review, I found no clear evidence that the Second Accused had specifically known of the existence of these three accounts, much less the fact of their use by the First Accused. The closest thing to Ms Cheng revealing this to the Second Accused was a message which showed the former offering the latter trading lines from her “private trust [accounts] with various custodians”.

 I was, however, unable to accept this as sufficient evidence. 1098 As stated in Er Joo Nguang at [35], the inference of a criminal conspiracy could only be justified if it was inexorable and irresistible. The inference needed to account for the relevant, and especially the critical facts of the case. I accepted that the accused persons did not need to know about the existence of each and every individual account to perpetuate their overarching Scheme. Indeed, I also accepted that a scheme of the nature advanced by the Prosecution operated on the premise that the various accounts which had been controlled were interchangeably used. However, in the present case, the mischief of such non-specific control was addressed by the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. The Deception Charges concerned specific accounts, and particular FIs being deceived as to a specific account’s use. This being the form of the Prosecution’s own charge, it could scarcely be inferred that conspiracies existed when there was insufficient evidence that the Second Accused had known of the existence of Alethia Elite’s accounts, much less that she had known about the First Accused using them. 1099 I should also add that I declined to draw an adverse inference against the Second Accused in relation to these accounts. In respect of these specific accounts, Ms Cheng testified that she had never informed the Second Accused of their existence,

 As against Ms Cheng’s testimony, I took the view that the Prosecution needed to adduce at least some evidence from which it could be inferred that Ms Cheng was either: (a) not telling the truth on these points; or (b) that the Second Accused nevertheless had knowledge of the accounts, irrespective of whether Ms Cheng was telling the truth. Such evidence must have warranted the Second Accused’s explanation, and, it would have been in the absence of such explanation that an adverse inference could justifiably have been drawn. 1100  The Prosecution drew my attention to many pieces of evidence and made several arguments in support of the inference that the Second Accused possessed knowledge of these three accounts.

 However, none of them shed a specific light on the three accounts of Alethia Elite with UBS and Coutts, though they related to other accounts.

 I ultimately found it an unsatisfactory position. After all, the contradiction to their case stemmed from Ms Cheng, who was a prosecution witness. 1101 Given the Second Accused’s lack of knowledge of these accounts, acquittals of the relevant Deception Charges were in order. There was, however, still the issue of what to make of the fact that the First Accused had controlled these three accounts. Of course, he could not be convicted of the Deception Charges given that they were for criminal conspiracy. But, by his control of the three accounts, it appeared that he nevertheless effected deceptions on UBS and Coutts on his own part. Put another way, he might be said to have committed the substantive offences under s 201(b) of the SFA without there being any criminal conspiracy with the Second Accused to do so. Amending the charges under s 128 of the CPC was a possible course to take but, ultimately, I declined to do so. This course of action entailed giving the First Accused the necessary opportunity to meet the amended charges (including the recalling of witnesses). Given the sheer large number of Deception Charges which the Prosecution had already brought against the First Accused, and the length of the trial, it would have been prejudicial to the First Accused for me to have proceeded with such a course. I thus acquitted the accused persons of the three Deception Charges to which Alethia Elite’s UBS and Coutts accounts related (ie, Charges 160, 161 and 162).Nine accounts managed by Alethia Asset1102 This group included the nine Relevant Accounts listed at [617] above. For the reasons set out at [618]–[630] above, I found that both accused persons had exercised control over the five accounts of Neptune Capital and Whitefield, but only the First Accused had exercised control over the four accounts of Cale Management and Carlos Place.1103 In respect of the former five accounts of Neptune Capital and Whitefield, no unique issues arose. Thus, I approached my analysis on the same footing as the other accounts in respect of which both accused persons had exercised control (see [1005]–[1007] above). That was, I took into account the points made at [988]–[989] as well as [1006(a)] and [1006(b)] above. On my review of the evidence, I was satisfied that the accused persons had conspired to deceive both UBS and Credit Suisse by concealing their involvement in the instructing of BAL orders and trades in the accounts. Accordingly, I convicted them of the five Deception Charges to which these accounts related (ie, Charges 86, 87, 93, 94 and 95).1104 There was, however, some difficulty which arose in respect of the accounts held by Cale Management and Carlos Place. To remind, Cale Management held one account with SocGen and Carlos Place held three accounts, one each with Crédit lndustriel, SocGen, and UBS. Although the Second Accused did not testify and there was thus no direct evidence as to the state of her knowledge in relation to these accounts, it was Ms Cheng’s evidence that they had been “secret accounts” which the First Accused had not wished for the Second Accused to know about. Their existence was thus kept from her.

 The questions to be answered, accordingly, were whether there had been such concealment from the Second Accused, and whether she nevertheless knew of the accounts, irrespective of their apparent concealment.1105 I begin with the most straightforward of these – Carlos Place’s account with Crédit lndustriel. On my review of the objective evidence, I found that Mr Billy Ooi, who was the controller of Carlos Place, had disclosed the existence of this account to the Second Accused. Despite several text messages from Ms Cheng to him asking him to handle the accounts under Carlos Place “discreetly” (for example: “Hi billy can u call me when avail? I was trying to caution u not to mention your accts at Barclays & cic to suling. John want to keep it discreet from her”),

 This showed plainly that the First Accused had changed his mind and allowed Mr Billy Ooi to mention his Crédit lndustriel account to the Second Accused.1106 Further, both Mr Billy Ooi’s Barclays as well as Crédit lndustriel accounts had been entered into the Shareholding Schedule.

 It was evident that the accounts had been disclosed to the Second Accused, and that she accordingly knew of their existence. Indeed, it could also be readily inferred that she had known of the First Accused’s usage of this Crédit lndustriel account. For the relatively short period since the account had been opened on 8 April 2013 until the end of the Relevant Period, the account traded almost S$37,000,000 in worth of BAL shares.

 Given the Second Accused’s deep involvement in the pair’s “market operations” (see [674] above), it was wholly improbable, especially given the contents of the Shareholding Schedule, that the Second Accused had not known that this account had been trading in BAL under the auspices of the First Accused.

 I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Deception Charge to which this account related (ie, Charge 120) had been made out, and I convicted the accused persons’ accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, I also found that the substantive s 201(b) offence underlying this charge had also been completed.1107 This brings me to the remaining three accounts of Cale Management and Carlos Place. In respect of these accounts, there was no direct evidence of the Second Accused’s knowledge. The Prosecution thus urged me to draw an adverse inference that the Second Accused had known of the existence of these accounts. They also relied on rather tangential pieces of evidence to show that she had known of the accounts’ existence:

(a) First, the Prosecution said that there was no reason for these accounts to have been kept secret from the Second Accused because she was well aware that the authorised signatories, Mr Billy Ooi and Dato Idris, had been nominees for numerous other Relevant Accounts. (b) Second, even though Ms Cheng had wanted the First Accused to conceal the accounts from the Second Accused, he had no incentive to do so. Therefore, as the exchange between Mr Billy Ooi and Ms Cheng above showed, the First Accused had allowed the Barclays and Crédit lndustriel accounts to be made known to her. (c) Third, the pattern of trading in these accounts fit the pattern of trading behaviour in other controlled accounts. Accordingly, given the “significant role [the Second Accused] had in managing and coordinating the market manipulation scheme, the inference to be drawn [was] that [she] must have known that these accounts existed and [had been] used in the [Scheme]”.

 1108 I was not satisfied that these pieces of evidence supported the conclusion which the Prosecution wished for me to reach. As I explained at [775] above, the First Accused had been in concurrent, intimate relationships with both the Second Accused and Ms Cheng. Both were, from the communications records available, evidently upset by this fact. This certainly would have had some impact on the overall Scheme, in particular, on the manner in which the First Accused managed its various actors and accounts. In this light, I saw some incentive for the First Accused to conceal these accounts from the Second Accused to keep the peace, as it were. 1109 I accepted that the First Accused did allow Mr Billy Ooi to reveal to the Second Accused the existence of Carlos Place’s Barclays and Crédit lndustriel accounts. However, this was not enough for me to draw the further inference that either Mr Billy Ooi, Dato Idris or the First Accused had also specifically revealed the existence of the remaining three accounts to the Second Accused. For completeness, I additionally note that the Prosecution argued that there was no need for the Second Accused to have been specifically apprised of the existence of these three accounts given the accused persons’ broad Scheme.

 I have explained why I rejected this argument at [977]–[983] above. I therefore found that it had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Second Accused had knowledge of the existence of these specific accounts, and, thus, she could not have been a party to narrow conspiracies to use them in such a way as to effect a deception on SocGen and UBS.1110 For the same reasons stated at [1101] above, I declined to substitute the charges for substantive s 201(b) charges just against the First Accused. Accordingly, I acquitted both accused persons of the Deception Charges to which these three accounts related (ie, Charges 96, 121 and 122).Summary: The Deception Charges1111 In summary, of the 161 Deception Charges which remained in issue at the end of trial (excluding Charge 153 of which the accused persons had been acquitted at the close of the Prosecution’s case, I convicted the accused persons of Charges 11 to 95, 97 to 120, 123 to 152, 154 to 156, 159, 163 to 172. I acquitted the accused persons of eight, ie, Charges 96, 121, 122, 157, 158, 160 to 162.1112 The acquitted charges concerned the following Relevant Accounts: (a) One account of Cale Management held with SocGen;(b) One account of Carlos Place held with SocGen;(c) One account of Carlos Place held with UBS;(d) One account of Ms Cheng held with CIMB;(e) One account of Ms Cheng held with Credit Suisse;(f) Two accounts of Alethia Elite held with UBS; and(g) One account of Alethia Elite held with Coutts.1113 The common thread connecting my decision in respect of each of these eight accounts and the Deception Charges to which they related, was the fact of Ms Cheng and the First Accused’s relationship, and the conflicts to which that gave rise vis-à-vis the latter’s concurrent relationship with the Second Accused. It was on this key footing, coupled with the gaps in the Prosecution’s evidence, that I arrived at the conclusion that First Accused had probably attempted to keep certain accounts under Ms Cheng’s management away from the Second Accused and out of her knowledge. Most likely, he did so to minimise tensions between the two women; tensions which were palpable from the recorded quarrel between the First Accused and Ms Cheng (as partially reproduced at [775] above) as well as the messages he had exchanged with the Second Accused.

1114 That, however, was a unique and isolated facet of the bigger picture. Where the other Relevant Accounts had been concerned, the evidence showed that both accused persons had been aware of the universe of accounts available for them to place BAL orders and trades in furtherance of their Scheme. Where they did not give such instructions personally, the evidence showed that they knew the other had been doing so. At no point did they seek to become properly authorised in respect of any of these accounts, and, to the contrary, the evidence showed that they had deliberately avoided such formalisation. All of this, in turn, made sense in the broader context of the Scheme and its objectives I found to have been established (see [850]–[869] and [889]–[894] above). Thus, from these key facts, assessed at the level of individual accounts or subgroups of accounts, it could be surmised that the accused persons entered into the many specific conspiracies alleged by the Deception Charges.The Cheating ChargesOverview of the Cheating Charges1115 I turn now to the final group of Conspiracy Charges, that is, the Cheating Charges. It will be recalled from [64]–[73] above that an important tenet of the Prosecution’s case was that by obtaining financing from various FIs, the accused persons were able to sustain and subsequently expand their operations. Financing was obtained in respect of many Relevant Accounts, but, of particular note were the margin facilities granted by Goldman Sachs to two accounts (one belonging to the Second Accused and the other belonging to Mr Hong), and by IB to four accounts (one each belonging to the Second Accused, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Chen).1116 These six accounts formed the subject of the Cheating Charges, and, as stated at [4(c)] above, by these six charges, it was alleged that the accused persons conspired to induce Goldman Sachs and IB to provide more than S$820 million in margin financing during the period of the Cheating Charges (see [68] above). The accused persons were said to have cheated these FIs by dishonestly concealing from them the fact that they had been “engaging in a course of conduct a purpose of which was to create a false appearance in the market for BAL shares”. I set out two charges as examples – one concerning Goldman Sachs and one concerning IB:

I therefore do not repeat them here save to say that the Prosecution needed to prove that the accused persons had entered into the six alleged conspiracies to commit the offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. 1118 These six conspiracies essentially had to be inferred from the accused persons’ conduct, amongst other things. Thus, it is useful to state the elements of the substantive offence of cheating under s 420. Although liability for criminal conspiracy does not turn on the substantive offence being made out, where the substantive offence is made out, that tends to support the inference that there existed a conspiracy to commit such offence in the first place. Of course, the offence of cheating can be proven independent of any underlying conspiracy, and vice-versa. However, given that it was the Prosecution’s case that all the Conspiracy Charges had resulted in completed offences, it was apposite to approach the Cheating Charges in this manner.1119 Cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code comprised three elements (see Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor [1997] 2 SLR(R) 946 at [42]–[44]). First, a deception must have been practised on the victim, and the victim must have been consequently deceived. Second, the victim must have been induced to deliver property to any person. Third, there must have been dishonest intent on the part of the accused persons.1120 The second and third elements were not contentious. As regards the first element, however, the parties disputed the requirements for a deception to be brought about by omission. The Prosecution’s case was that the accused persons deceived Goldman Sachs and IB by dishonestly concealing from these two FIs the fact that BAL shares had been the subject of false trading. There was no dispute that a “dishonest concealment” of facts could constitute a deception (see Explanation 1 to s 415 of the Penal Code) and there was also no dispute that a person could be deceived by omissions (see Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor [1997] 3 SLR(R) 227 at [24]). However, the Defence argued that in order for a deception to be brought about by an omission, the accused person in question must have been under an attending duty to disclose the relevant fact or a state of affairs which would have dispelled the misapprehension. Alternatively, there must be “circumstances where silence itself [was] in itself a statement”.

1121 The Prosecution refuted the requirement of a duty of disclosure. Chiefly, they pointed to Illustration (e) of s 415 of the Penal Code, which provides:Illustrations…(e) A, by pledging as diamonds articles which he knows are not diamonds, intentionally deceives Z, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend money. A cheats.1122 This, the Prosecution argued, exemplified that the case advanced here could amount to cheating irrespective of whether the accused persons owed either Goldman Sachs or IB obligations of disclosure.

1123 I preferred the Prosecution’s account of the law. My reasons follow.(a) First, in Iridium India Telecom Ltd v Motorola Incorporated (2011) 1 SCC 74, commenting on the Explanation to s 415 of the Indian Penal Code (which is identical to Explanation 1 of our version of s 415), the Supreme Court of India remarked that the “non-disclosure of relevant information would also be treated as a mis-representation of facts leading to deception” (at [42]). (b) Second, and more importantly, there was nothing about Explanation 1 which suggested that “concealment” could only be effected if the accused person was under a separate legal obligation to disclose the relevant information. This, in my view, was an unnecessarily narrow view of the Explanation. There are a huge number of ways by which an offender could potentially cheat a victim by dishonestly concealing a state of affairs. Not all of these modes of cheating would be premised on a separate and distinct obligation of disclosure arising either from the specific relationship between the particular offender and victim, or from the type of offender and victim as a class.(c) Third, this did not render the Explanation too broad. The words of Explanation 1 itself make clear that the relevant concealment must be “dishonest”, and s 24 of the Penal Code has defined “dishonesty” as follows: “Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly”. The need to ascertain the intent behind the concealment, coupled with the further need to determine whether the information concealed by the accused person may be said to have induced the victim to deliver property, were plainly sufficient controls over the scope of the offence. An accused person who dishonestly conceals information which does not induce the victim to deliver property can scarcely be said to cheat. Conversely, an accused person who inadvertently fails to disclose information that induces the victim to deliver property does not act dishonestly and therefore also cannot be said to have cheated. There was simply no need, as the Defence submitted, for the scope of a cheating offence committed by concealment, to be limited by the existence of a separate and distinct legal obligation of disclosure.1124 With this, I turn to set out the grounds of my decision in respect of each Cheating Charge brought against the accused persons.The two Relevant Accounts held with Goldman Sachs1125 My decisions on the Cheating Charges pertaining to the Goldman Sachs accounts held in the names of the Second Accused and Mr Hong were largely built on the same evidential premises. This was because the facts and circumstances surrounding the opening, financing, and use of the accounts were largely the same. I therefore set them out generally before turning to my reasoning in respect of the individual charges. 1126 Four strands of evidence were salient to these two charges:(a) First, the accused persons had exercised control over these two accounts. This has been addressed earlier. As explained at [569]–[599] and [644] above, I found that the accused persons had controlled these two accounts, and that they had done so in connection with their broad Scheme to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares. In respect of both accounts, the Second Accused was the one who conveyed trading instructions to Mr William Chan, the intermediary appointed to manage these accounts.

 Mr William Chan had acted on the Second Accused’s instructions. (b) Second, both accused persons had played a role in the opening of the two Goldman Sachs accounts. This has also been addressed at [569]–[599] and [637]–[647] above. Although the Second Accused’s involvement in the opening of her own account was nothing out of the ordinary, her involvement in the opening of Mr Hong’s account was. The First Accused’s involvement in the opening of both accounts was clearly unusual. More saliently, I found that after the accounts had been opened in February 2013,

 the First Accused made arrangements for around 20,000,000 Asiasons shares to be transferred into each of the two accounts. Such shares were taken as the initial collateral Goldman Sachs required to provide margin financing. Later, in May 2013, the First Accused, with the knowledge of the Second Accused, made further arrangements for an additional 10,000,000 Asiasons shares to be deposited into each of the two accounts. Such shares were also collateralised and more margin financing was provided by Goldman Sachs thereon. For a detailed breakdown of the collateral deposited into these accounts, see [594]–[596] above.(c) Third, the cash balances of the two accounts were never positive. This meant that, for the eight months or so following the opening of the accounts until the Crash, every purchase of securities made using the accounts was a purchase that had been financed by Goldman Sachs (chiefly, the accounts had been used to purchase LionGold shares).

 The Second Accused and Mr Hong had not paid in cash for any shares purchased using their accounts. On this footing, Mr Moo gave evidence that the “total (cumulative) amount of financing provided by Goldman Sachs to each account was equal to the amount paid by Goldman Sachs to settle the trades in that account, which [was] approximately S$69.36 million for [the Second Accused’s] account, and S$73.23 million for Mr Hong’s account”.

 (d) Fourth, Mr Moo testified that Goldman Sachs had extended the aforementioned sums as margin financing on the collateral provided because it “was not aware of any matters which suggested that the demand for [BAL shares] was false or misleading. Had Goldman Sachs known [this]… [it] would not have extended such credit or made payment for such purchases”.

 1127 With the general evidence pertaining to these two charges set out, I turn to my analysis of whether the specific charges had been made out. In this connection, it is also necessary to address whether the Prosecution only succeeded in proving conspiracies to cheat, or, whether the Prosecution additionally managed to prove that the accused persons had completed the underlying cheating offences in violation of s 420 of the Penal Code. I start with Charge 173, which concerned the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs account.1128 As suggested at [1118] above, it was analytically beneficial to assess the Cheating Charges on the footing that they had been completed, before turning to the question of whether there was a combination between the accused persons to cheat, pursuant to each Cheating Charge. Accordingly, I begin with the first element of the s 420 offence – that being the requirements that the accused persons practised a deception on Goldman Sachs, and the need for Goldman Sachs to have actually been deceived.1129 Two preliminary points prefaced my analysis of this element. The first was my determination that the accused persons were guilty of the two False Trading Charges relating to Asiasons shares (ie, Charges 4 and 5) (see [902]–[905] above), and the second was my finding that they had created a false market in respect of BAL shares during the Relevant Period (see [889]–[911] above generally). These were crucial starting points because, as the individuals at the centre of the false trading of Asiasons shares during the Relevant Period, the accused persons plainly knew that the liquidity of the Asiasons shares being pledged to Goldman Sachs had been artificially inflated. Furthermore, as both Goldman Sachs accounts had been opened in February 2013, in the thick of the Relevant Period, no issue arose as regards the timing of their knowledge.

 1130 It cannot seriously be doubted that it is relevant and material for a bank to which shares are being pledged as collateral, to know that those shares are the subject of manipulative trading practices. To suggest otherwise would be to encourage concealment. Thus, given the lack of disclosure of such information by the Second Accused, to whom this account belonged, I found that a deception had been practised on Goldman Sachs.1131 This brings me to whether Goldman Sachs had actually been deceived by the Second Accused’s omission and, connectedly, whether the FI had been induced to provide financing because of this deception. This straddled the first and second elements of the offence (see [1119] above). On this issue, apart from Mr Moo, Mr Wang gave evidence on behalf of Goldman Sachs that had the bank known that the markets for BAL shares were being manipulated in any way, it would not have extended financing against BAL shares as collateral.

 Accordingly, if such evidence was accepted, that supported the clear conclusion that Goldman Sachs had indeed been deceived and induced to deliver funding. 1132 I should note that the primary basis on which the accused persons disputed the Cheating Charges was that they were not guilty of the False Trading Charges.

 However, that defence fell away with my decision on those charges. Thus, this section will only address the accused persons’ alternative defence. On this footing, the Defence’s contention was that Goldman Sachs had not been deceived or induced to deliver funding on the grounds that it had utilised a complex and thorough system to calculate the quantum of margin financing which could be granted against the collateral deposited (known as the ‘PRISM’ system). In support of this argument, the Defence pointed to Mr Wang’s evidence that the PRISM system did not require any input from the customer in terms of representations or warranties, and insofar as the accounts with Goldman Sachs were concerned, everything was done in accordance with the standard PRISM system requirements.

 Thus, it was said that Goldman Sachs had not been “hoodwinked into accepting BAL shares as collateral”.

 1133 While I understood the submission, it seemed to me to miss the mark. Although the PRISM system was capable of calculating the margin requirements of any given collateral without input, the information concealed in this case, if it had been provided to Goldman Sachs, would have obviated the need for a PRISM assessment entirely. Put simply, if Goldman Sachs had known that BAL shares were the subject of false trading, even if the FI had undertaken a PRISM assessment, I could hardly imagine that it would have relied on such an assessment. The fact that Goldman Sachs granted financing upon the PRISM assessment was therefore not an answer to the question of whether Goldman Sachs had been deceived and, connectedly, whether it had been induced by this deception to provide financing. On this, I accepted Mr Wang’s evidence and found that, had Goldman Sachs been apprised of the false trading ongoing with BAL shares, any PRISM calculations would not have mattered in their considerations.1134 The last element of the offence was whether the accused persons had acted with dishonest intent (see [1119] above). This overlapped substantially with the underlying inferential question to be answered in respect of Charges 173 and 174. That was, whether there had been conspiracies to cheat Goldman Sachs. I answered this question in the affirmative and, in arriving at this conclusion, I chiefly relied on Mr William Chan’s evidence, as well as the objective evidence in support of his account (see [594]–[596] above), that the First Accused had been actively involved in setting up both Mr Hong and the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs accounts as well as sourcing for and obtaining BAL shares which had been used as collateral in their accounts. Given my findings in respect of the False Trading Charges, it could plainly be inferred from this that both accused persons had acted with dishonest intent. They would have known the outcome of their own overarching Scheme to manipulate the markets for BAL shares, and the fact that they proceeded to procure financing from Goldman Sachs strongly supported the inference of dishonesty and, indeed, the existence of such conspiracies.1135 However, beyond that, there were two questions which, if answered, would have helped account for the existence of such conspiracies.(a) The first was why the accused persons even needed, in the first place, to conspire to induce Goldman Sachs to provide margin financing. This question was addressed by Mr William Chan’s evidence that the accused persons had been looking for financing arrangements after Credit Suisse had terminated its financing arrangements with Mr Hong, Mr Billy Ooi as well as the Second Accused in February 2013 (see [593] and [647] above). Following that termination, the accused persons and Mr Hong met Mr William Chan to request that he find another bank which would extend financing on similar terms, specifically, one which would allow them to collateralise Asiasons shares to purchase LionGold shares. That they had such intentions leading up to the establishment of the Goldman Sachs account showed plainly that they had intended to obtain financing on manipulated shares before even knowing which FI would be open to such an arrangement. This was clear evidence of their conspiracies. (b) The second question was, given the accused persons’ ability to conduct rollover contra trading using the Local Accounts, why they preferred or required financed margin accounts. The Prosecution’s answer to this question was twofold. (i) One, Mr Leroy Lau

 both gave evidence that using BAL shares as collateral had the benefit of “locking them up” such that there were fewer BAL shares in circulation. The use of margin accounts thus made it easier for the accused persons to retain control of BAL shares without having to coordinate as many wash trades on a rolling contra basis. The reduced volume of contra trading, in turn, also minimised the need for the accused persons to draw down on their personal cash resources. While this came with the added risk of a margin call in the event of a drop in the share price

 or when the FI otherwise varied its gearing ratio in respect of the share (see [672]–[673] above in relation to IB), these risks were mitigated by the fact that the Relevant Accounts (as a unit) exercised dominant control over most of the issued BAL shares.

 (ii) Two, when margin Relevant Accounts were used to purchase free of payment shares from other Relevant Accounts, the accused persons could effectively transmute the margin financing facilities into cash (through the selling account), whilst still retaining control of the BAL shares (through the purchasing account). The manner in which the accused persons coordinated trades to monetise BAL shares in this manner was discussed at [870]–[879] above. These points provided additional context for why the accused persons sought out margin financing accounts in general and, in so doing, also supported the inference that the accused persons had specifically “agreed to cheat Goldman Sachs” by procuring such financing from the FI.1136 Thus, I found the accused persons guilty of Charge 173 and convicted them accordingly. Moreover, as stated at [1128], my analysis above both addressed the conspiracy to cheat as well as the substantive offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, and, given that Goldman Sachs did provide financing to the Second Accused’s account, I was also satisfied that the substantive cheating offence underlying Charge 173 had been completed.1137 I turn next to Charge 174, which concerned Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account. For substantially the same reasons given in respect of the Second Accused’s account from [1127]–[1136] above, I was also satisfied that: (a) the accused persons had conspired to cheat Goldman Sachs in relation to Mr Hong’s account; (b) that Goldman Sachs had in fact been deceived; (c) that Goldman Sachs had been induced by that deception to provide financing; and (d) that the accused persons had acted with dishonest intent.1138 Indeed, as mentioned at [594] above, when asked whether he agreed that the placement of Asiasons shares as collateral in his Goldman Sachs account had been directed by the First Accused, Mr Hong answered, “Yes, as advised by him. Arranged by him”.

1139 Mr William Chan’s evidence corroborated Mr Hong’s evidence that the First Accused had been responsible for arranging the placement of collateral in his account.

 1140 From the foregoing, it was clear that the First Accused had been involved in the procurement of financing. And, considered alongside my findings in respect of the False Trading Charges as well as my observations at [1134]–[1135] above, there was ample basis to conclude that he had intended to cheat Goldman Sachs by inducing them to provide margin financing on the collateral of manipulated shares. The slightly more involved question was whether there had been a meeting of the minds between him and the Second Accused in this regard such that Charge 174 was made out.1141 In so far as the Second Accused had been concerned, communications between her and Mr William Chan showed plainly that she had been apprised of the fact that the First Accused had been making similar arrangements for the deposit of Asiasons shares as collateral into Mr Hong’s account as with her account. On 6 May 2013, Mr William Chan sent her a Blackberry message, “Hi. Are you back? Can u authorise payment? Thks :)”.

 1142 Further, as I stated at [596]–[598] above, Mr William Chan testified that it was the Second Accused who had given instructions for most of the BAL trades entered in both hers and Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs accounts. Accordingly, given the Second Accused’s knowledge of the overarching Scheme as well as the manner in which collateral had been procured and placed in both hers and Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs accounts, each time the Second Accused had instructed trades in those accounts, she was effectively causing the FI to provide financing. 1143 All that being said, I was mindful that unlike Charge 173 this account did not belong to either accused person and, as such, there was an issue of how the accused persons actually practised a deception on Goldman Sachs, specifically, at the point when Goldman Sachs had been deciding whether to provide margin financing on the collateral of Asiasons shares on the account at all. 1144 To address this point, the Prosecution relied on Explanation 3 to s 415 of the Penal Code, which provides: “Whoever makes a representation through any agent is to be treated as having made the representation himself”. Their submission was that, notwithstanding that this provision seems to require a positive representation, it should equally apply to negative cases involving omissions. Thus, using Illustration (e) as an example (see [1121] above), they contended that an accused person who procures an agent to pledge diamonds as articles which he knows are not diamonds stands in the same position as if he had acted himself. On the facts of the present case, the Prosecution argued that Mr William Chan was the one who had facilitated the depositing of BAL shares and, so, was the “agent” for these purposes.

 1146 Though I appreciated the point being made by the Defence, I did not accept it. Ultimately, I found as a matter of fact that the accused persons had controlled Mr Hong’s Goldman Sachs account. This being the case, it would have been extremely technical to absolve them of liability for cheating on the basis that the intermediary, Mr William Chan, had not been apprised of the underlying market manipulation and, thus, could not have dishonestly omitted to inform Goldman Sachs of such manipulation. Indeed, if I had allowed this argument, that would likely have enabled more surreptitious modes of deception as all an accused person would need to do to avoid liability is interpose an uninitiated third party between himself and the victim of cheating by dishonest concealment. This was plainly unpalatable and, although not on all fours with either Explanation 3 or Illustration (e) to s 415 of the Penal Code, my view was that it is possible to cheat under s 415 through an uninitiated agent who, by the fact of his lack of knowledge, cannot help but to omit the crucial information that operates as a deception on the victim of the offence. Accordingly, the fact that Mr William Chan interposed the accused persons’ dealings with Goldman Sachs in relation to Mr Hong’s account was not a basis on which the accused persons could avoid liability for Charge 173.1147 Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I found that the accused persons had agreed to cheat Goldman Sachs by inducing them to provide margin financing on collateral that had been the subject of the accused persons’ Scheme of market manipulation. I convicted them of Charge 174 accordingly. Moreover, as Goldman Sachs furnished financing to Mr Hong’s account, I was also satisfied that the substantive cheating offence underlying Charge 174 had been completed. The four Relevant Accounts held with IB1148 As with the two accounts held with Goldman Sachs, the starting point for my analysis of the Cheating Charges relating to the Second Accused, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Chen’s IB accounts was the fact that these accounts had also been controlled by the accused persons. 1149 In this connection, and beyond the general fact of “control”, Mr Chen gave direct and specific evidence that “[a]ll the cash and collateral in [his] trading accounts [had been] arranged for by [the First Accused]”,

 In relation to the IB accounts more generally, it will be recalled from [670(a)] that the IB accounts had been opened on the accused persons’ instructions and, according to Mr Tai, the initial collateral placed in the accounts comprised only cash, which had also been furnished by the accused persons.

 This cash collateral was sufficient to obtain some financing, which the accused persons then used to purchase BAL shares. The shares that had been purchased in turn constituted additional collateral against which IB extended further margin financing pursuant to the method by which IB determined financing limits.

 1150 The accused persons’ heavy involvement in the management of the IB accounts’ collateral could also be gleaned from the Mr Tai’s evidence in relation to the October 2012 force-selling incident set out at [672] above. Not only did Mr Tai’s evidence reveal that the First Accused had been involved in the placement of collateral in the IB accounts, but it also showed that he had gone to great lengths to manage the collateral-related issues which arose with the accounts. Specifically, Mr Tai stated that he had impersonated Mr Neo when engaging IB in discussions about the topping up of collateral to stave off force-selling. Although there was no recording of the First Accused impersonating Mr Neo on that occasion, there were recordings of him doing so after the Crash (see [104] above). Thus, the fact that the First Accused had impersonated Mr Neo more than once indicated the truth of Mr Tai’s evidence in relation to the October 2012 force-selling incident. 1151 Mr Tai’s testimony in relation to the period after this force-selling incident was also salient. As stated at [673] above, the accused persons were unhappy with how IB had managed the incident and contemplated closing all 11 Relevant Accounts held with the FI. However, they ultimately decided against it and, following a conversation between the First Accused and Mr Tai, it was decided that attention would be paid primarily to the Second Accused, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK and Mr Chen’s accounts. Thus, and thereafter, the accused persons arranged for additional cash to be transferred into these four accounts. This was supported by an email sent by Mr Tai to IB stating:

 also showed that around between S$1 million and S$1.5 million had indeed been deposited into each of these accounts between October and November 2012. Specifically, S$1,534,718 had been deposited into the Second Accused’s account, S$1,037,752 into Mr Neo’s account, S$1,125,438 into Mr Tan BK’s account, and S$1,017,998 into Mr Chen’s account.1152 I found it telling that the very manner in which Mr Tai had spoken about the IB accounts seemed to suggest that 11 Relevant Accountholders had been acting as a unit. If each of the 11 accountholders had been separate and independent investors who had entrusted the management of their IB accounts to Mr Tai, it made little sense that they would have agreed to “focus on 4 accounts”. The contents of Mr Tai’s email were thus revealing of the accused persons’ common administration of the IB accounts both in general and specifically in relation to matters concerning collateral. 1153 On that note, I return to whether the financing granted by IB to the four accounts on cash collateral had been used by the accused persons to purchase BAL shares. On Mr Tai’s evidence, it had been. Specifically, Mr Tai said that the four accounts had primarily been used to purchase and “lock up” Asiasons shares.

 This was consistent with the SGX trading data, which showed that the accounts had been used actively to purchase Asiasons shares from late October 2012 onwards (ie, after the force-selling incident). 1154 All of this pointed firmly towards the conclusion that the accused persons had not only exercised control over these four IB accounts, but they had also additionally made arrangements for these accounts to secure margin financing from the FI. To do so, the accused persons initially provided cash collateral. Had financing been furnished on cash collateral alone, the Cheating Charges would plainly not have been made out. However, as stated, such financing had then been used to purchase Asiasons shares, shares which the accused persons knew were the subject of market manipulation, so that such shares could be used as additional collateral to obtain more financing. While this series of events was slightly less direct than that seen with the Goldman Sachs accounts where the accused persons arranged for manipulated Asiasons shares to be deposited as collateral, it ultimately accomplished the same outcome. That was, the provision of financing by the FI, furnished on the basis of Asiasons shares. 1155 Thus, analysis of the four Cheating Charges which related to IB accounts could be undertaken on the same premises as those in relation to Goldman Sachs. In fact, both the Prosecution and Defence’s cases in respect of the four Cheating Charges pertaining to IB accounts were basically the same as that in respect of the two Cheating Charges pertaining to Goldman Sachs accounts. Their respective written submissions also dealt with all six Cheating Charges as a group, with minimal attention paid to the differences between the charges as they related to the two FIs.

 There was therefore no issue with approaching these four charges in this manner and I accordingly turn to elements of the s 420 offence set out at [1119] above.(a) As regards the former part of the first element, for the same essential reasons set out at [1128]–[1130] above, I found that a deception had been practised on IB. I was mindful of the Defence’s contention that Mr Tai was “very territorial” and that he had “deliberately made sure there [had not been any] contact or interface between the accused persons and IB”.

 This contention was raised to make the point that the accused persons could not have practised any deception on IB when they had been precluded from engaging IB directly. However, this argument did not cut ice. For one, I did not accept the factual assertion that Mr Tai was “very territorial”. As I explained above, quite apart from the actual control of the trades carried out in the IB accounts, the accused persons had been heavily involved in securing and managing issues with the collateral in the accounts. This cut against the claim that Mr Tai had been “territorial”. In any case, as explained at [1143]–[1146] above, there was no need for the accused persons to have dealt directly with IB in order for an offence under s 420 to be made out. It was sufficient for them to do so through Mr Tai.(b) As regards the latter part of the first element as well as the second element, ie, whether IB had actually been deceived and, connectedly, induced to provide financing, Ms Mary Ng gave evidence on behalf of IB that it had been,

 This submission was principally the same as that based on Goldman Sachs’ PRISM system as discussed from [1131]–[1133] above, and, for the same reasons, I rejected it. (c) As regards the third and last element, I noted that Mr Tai’s email (reproduced at [1151] above) clearly showed the accused persons’ intention to use the initial financing granted on cash collateral to purchase more Asiasons and LionGold shares. They must have known that those shares would then be collateralised in the IB accounts and that would, in turn, result in IB providing even more funding to purchase even more BAL shares. And, when this was coupled with the same essential considerations set out [1134]–[1135] above, it appeared to me that the most appropriate conclusion was that the accused persons had acted with dishonest intent to cheat IB. Indeed, from their extensive involvement with these accounts, their conspiracies to do so could be readily inferred.1156 Accordingly, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Prosecution had proven the four Cheating Charges relating to Relevant Accounts held with IB (ie, Charges 175, 176, 177 and 178), and I convicted the accused persons of those charges accordingly. Moreover, given that IB had in fact provided financing to these accounts on the collateral of manipulated BAL shares, I also found that the substantive s 420 offences had been completed.Summary: The Cheating Charges1157 In summary, I convicted the accused persons of all six Cheating Charges which had been brought against them. In respect of each of these conspiracy charges, I found that the accused persons had also completed the underlying substantive offence under s 420 of the Penal Code and this, in turn, had consequences in terms of sentencing (see [1319]–[1339] and [1410]–[1423] below).The Company Management Charges1158 Having set out my decision in respect of the Conspiracy Charges, I now turn to the two groups of charges which had only been brought against the First Accused. 1159 To reiterate, as mentioned at [4(d)] above, the first group concerned the First Accused’s involvement in the management of BAL, ie, the Company Management Charges. Such involvement, as I have alluded to at [850]–[869] above, was said by the Prosecution to have complemented the accused persons’ broad Scheme because, by being in such a position, the First Accused could take steps to link BAL’s corporate activities with the manner, extent, and timing of their market manipulation Scheme. For example, as set out at [96]–[99] above, there was evidence that the accused persons had coordinated the trading activity in the controlled Relevant Accounts so as to push up the price of Asiasons shares alongside the release of positive announcements. This, in turn, conveyed the impression that the positive impact flowed from the fact of the announcement. 1160 In the subsections which follow, I will state my findings in respect of whether the First Accused had been involved in the management of the companies during the Relevant Period. The meaning of “concerned in the management of any corporation”1161 Section 148(1) of the Companies Act provides:Restriction on undischarged bankrupt being director or manager148.—(1) Every person who, being an undischarged bankrupt (whether he was adjudged bankrupt by a Singapore Court or a foreign court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy), acts as director of, or directly or indirectly takes part in or is concerned in the management of, any corporation, except with the leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.[emphasis added] 1162 Contrary to the First Accused’s suggestion that s 148(1) did not generally contemplate the management of public-listed companies (see [152] above),

 this provision as well as the authorities did not draw a distinction between cases along such lines. Indeed, the requirements for an offence to be made out under this provision were straightforward, and only one was put in issue. The First Accused did not dispute that he was, and had been since 14 January 2002, an undischarged bankrupt.

 There was also no suggestion that the First Accused had obtained the leave of the court or of the Official Assignee to be involved in the management of either Blumont, Asiasons, or LionGold. Therefore, the exception in s 148(1) was irrelevant and the only question was whether the First Accused had, in fact, been concerned in the management of each of the three companies.1163 This question necessarily turned on what it meant to be “concerned in the management” of any corporation. I took the view that this statement was to be interpreted broadly. As Steven Chong J (as he then was) observed in Yap Guat Beng v Public Prosecutor [2011] 2 SLR 689 (“Yap Guat Beng”) (affirming the views taken in R v Sundranpillai Theivendran (1992) 13 Cr App Rep (S) 601 at 603, Re Magna Alloys & Research Pty Ltd (1975) 1 ACLR 203 at 205, and Re Altim Pty Ltd [1968] 2 NSWR 762 at 764):1 The prohibition against an undischarged bankrupt from managing (or being a director of) a company or a business as found in s 148(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) and s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act (Cap 32, 2004 Rev Ed) serves the important role of safeguarding the interests of the business’ existing creditors, as well as the interests of potential creditors of the business, who may be unaware of the financial status of persons in charge of such businesses.2 The prohibition also serves to protect the greater public interest to prevent the undischarged bankrupt from misusing the corporate structure for collateral purposes to the detriment of stakeholders such as the company’s shareholders, the business’ trading partners and suppliers, consumers, and the general public who depend on the services and/or products of such businesses or companies.…39 In light of the authorities above, it is clear to me that the prohibition on managing a company or business (or being a director of a company) found in s 148(1) of the Companies Act and s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act is premised on protective considerations...1164 As articulated, the statutory objective of s 148(1) supported the view that the phrase “being concerned in the management of any corporation” should be given a broad interpretation. Support for this could also be drawn from cases such as Re Haeusler, Thomas [2021] 4 SLR 1407 at [92], R v Campbell (Archibald James) [1984] BCLC 83 at 87–88, and Commissioner for Corporate Affairs (Vic) v Bracht (1988) 14 ACLR 728. 1165 In my view, the provision should catch persons who are given some measure of responsibility or area of discretion, or whose opinion is given some weight in the decision-making processes, on matters which affect the company and the conduct of its affairs. A person does not have to be at the highest echelons of a company to be concerned in its management. He need not have a formal position. However, conversely, a person who carries out mere administrative functions pursuant to predetermined policies or directions, without any significant discretion, or an advisory role in decision-making, would not be caught by this phrase. With these principles in mind, I turn to the reasons for which I convicted the First Accused of all three Company Management Charges.Charge 179: Involvement in the management of Blumont1166 The Company Management Charge relating to Blumont read:That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 2 January and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, while being an undischarged bankrupt (having been adjudged bankrupt by a court in Malaysia having jurisdiction in bankruptcy), were concerned in the management of Blumont Group Ltd, without leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 148(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50).1167 In respect of whether the First Accused had been involved in the management of Blumont, the evidence of Mr Hong, Mr Chen, and Mr Nicholas Ng was relevant, and there was also objective evidence. The First Accused denied having any formal involvement in the management of Blumont and testified that he only acted as an informal advisor to the company’s Executive Chairman, Mr Neo.

1168 Given the First Accused’s position, I begin with the objective evidence. The starting point was how the persons holding official managerial positions in Blumont treated and regarded the First Accused. On 29 January 2013, the First Accused and Mr Hong (the CEO and Executive Director of Blumont), had the following exchange:

 I could not believe this. The message from Mr Hong was plainly addressed to “Dato”, ie, the First Accused. The messages did not suggest in any way that Mr Hong was aware that Mr Neo was with the First Accused, nor did they explain why it was necessary for Mr Hong to contact the First Accused in this manner instead of Mr Neo directly. 1170 In any event, the travel records of the First Accused and Mr Neo also showed that the First Accused’s explanation was untrue. On 29 January 2013, the First Accused had been in Malaysia while Mr Neo was in Singapore.

 This cast substantial doubt on the credibility of the First Accused’s evidence, at least in so far as the subject of this charge was concerned. Indeed, when confronted with the travel records at the trial, the First Accused somewhat dialled back his defence by claiming that Mr Hong had contacted him because he was unable to reach Mr Neo.

 I could not believe this either. Once again, nothing about the message suggested that Mr Hong was urgently trying to reach Mr Neo, and seeking the First Accused’s potential assistance in that connection. 1171 In the end, Mr Hong’s description of the First Accused’s role was probably the most accurate. When asked about this series of questions and why he seemed to be asking for the First Accused’s go-ahead, Mr Hong began with an explanation that the First Accused had been “instrumental in introducing the deal to [Blumont]”. On this footing, Mr Neo apparently directed Mr Hong to “follow up” with the First Accused on “matters relating to [the] acquisition”. When asked what exactly he had been directed by Mr Neo to follow up with, Mr Hong said “if I recall correctly, Datuk Soh will be managing and advising the company in all aspect pertaining to the acquisition”.

 Although this was not itself particularly probative, it was consistent with Mr Chen’s evidence that, during the Relevant Period, both Mr Hong and Mr Neo had addressed the First Accused as “boss” in his presence. Moreover, Mr Chen also testified that, in meetings where the three were present, it was the First Accused who would present his ideas for Blumont’s business. Mr Hong and Mr Neo were the ones who proposed modes of execution. In the round, Mr Chen’s evidence was that the First Accused was the person who made the “final decision on all corporate matters”.

 1173 This, in turn, was also consistent with Mr Nicholas Ng’s evidence. As I will set out from [1187] below, Mr Nicholas Ng gave evidence that the First Accused had been extensively involved in the management of LionGold. He initially also took this position in respect of Blumont and Asiasons. However, when he gave evidence at the trial, he downplayed his knowledge of the First Accused’s involvement in either Blumont or Asiasons.

 The Prosecution then applied to cross-examine him using his prior investigative statements. In respect of Blumont specifically, he was confronted with a statement he had given to the CAD on 2 July 2019. There, Mr Nicholas Ng had stated: “even Blumont also took his [the First Accused] instructions with regard to acquisition deals”. Mr Nicholas Ng even stated that, for all three companies, the First Accused was the “overall deal-maker”.

 Question (DPP Mr Tan): Now, do you see the difference in your answers versus what you said in court? In your answers, in your CAD statement, you are saying he’s the overall deal-maker for all three companies, and that, specifically, even Blumont took his instructions for acquisition deals. Whereas in court this morning, you said you don’t know and you never knew.Answer (Mr Nicholas Ng): I -- what I’m saying is, in general, he make decisions for all these companies. So -- yeah, in general, he was a general decision-maker in all these companies.This answer did not require further explanation.1175 There were other instances where the First Accused’s confirmation had been sought for deals involving Blumont. On 7 May 2013, one Mr Patric Lim, a fund manager, had sent an email simply titled “Deals”. In this email, the First Accused was invited to consider the acquisition of 60% of Cokal Ltd (“Cokal”) for either US$30 million in cash, or US$5 million in cash and US$25 million in Blumont shares. Rather tellingly, Mr Patric Lim ended this email with the following statement: “Let me know if we can proceed with this opportunit[y]”.

 1176 The character of the First Accused’s involvement, in my judgment, patently suggested that he had been involved in the management of Blumont contrary to s 148(1) of the Companies Act. His involvement was not merely in the vein of being an administrative manager who handled the routine daily activities of the company. The foregoing examples showed his participation in longer-term strategic decisions, and, more importantly, such decisions involved the spending of substantial company funds.1177 The First Accused’s explanations made no sense. I stated my views on the Celsius deal above. As regards the Cokal deal, the First Accused denied that this had anything to do with Blumont.

 Neither of this was borne out by the plain and obvious facts. In the first place, Mr Patric Lim’s email made no mention of Mr Neo nor was there anything about its tone or contents which suggested that the First Accused was being asked to speak with Mr Neo about the deal. Second, there was simply no denying the deal concerned Blumont. As stated, on 8 July 2013, Blumont announced the deal.

 In this email Mr Paul Struijk essentially summarised an agreement regarding his appointment as “executive vice Chairman” of Blumont. This email contained key terms such as his salary, housing allowance, and stock options. At the end of the email, Mr Paul Struijk wrote: “I believe the above reflects our agreement. Let me know how you wish to formalize agreement between BLU and myself” [emphasis added]. The First Accused was asked to explain this email in cross-examination and his answer was that he had subsequently brought the proposal to Mr Neo.

 This explanation could not hold. The email suggested that the agreement had already been entered and the only matter outstanding was its formalisation. Further, nothing about the email even suggested that Mr Neo had been involved. 1179 All of the foregoing pointed, without reasonable doubt, to the conclusion that the First Accused had been involved in the management of Blumont. Not only that, the evidence showed that his involvement was at a very high level in the company, if not, at its very apex. The legal threshold as set out at [1165] above had thus plainly been crossed and I accordingly convicted the First Accused of Charge 179.Charge 180: Involvement in the management of Asiasons1180 The Company Management Charge relating to Asiasons read:That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 1 August 2012 and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, while being an undischarged bankrupt (having been adjudged bankrupt by a court in Malaysia having jurisdiction in bankruptcy), were concerned in the management of Asiasons Capital Limited, without leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 148(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50).1181 The nature of the First Accused’s involvement in the management of Asiasons was quite similar to that of Blumont discussed above. For example, there were emails which suggested strongly that the First Accused had been involved in Asiasons’ deal-making, in particular, Asiasons’ acquisition of Black Elk.

 at [853]–[869] above in connection with the accused persons’ broader plan for their Scheme. That was, an email dated 26 August 2013 from Mr Nordlicht which suggested that the First Accused had been involved in discussions about Asiasons’ business generally and the Black Elk deal specifically. Although I stated there that this email did not shed light on the accused persons’ broader Scheme, that was an analytically distinct issue. In so far as the Company Management Charge for Asiasons was concerned, the email was revealing.1182 This was because, unlike Blumont where the First Accused at least testified that he had acted as Mr Neo’s informal advisor and had plans to take over as Blumont’s CEO once he was discharged from bankruptcy, the First Accused initially gave evidence that he only had a “remote” link to Asiasons through Dato Jared (the joint-Managing Director of Asiasons during the Relevant Period)

 Put simply, given the First Accused’s denial that he was even involved in the business of Asiasons, there was even less reason for him to have been involved in Asiasons’ deal-making. Yet, the emails as well as the evidence of Mr Nicholas Ng (see [1173] above) showed clearly that the First Accused had been involved in Asiasons’ business in such a manner.1183 There were two other highly probative pieces of objective evidence which supported the conclusion that the First Accused had been involved in the management of Asiasons. First, on 23, 26 and 27 April 2013, the First Accused exchanged several messages with one Ms Shireen Muhideen.

In essence, he stated that his friends who were shareholders of Asiasons, persons such as Tun Daim, had opposed the resolutions that were being proposed. The First Accused himself stated that he was unhappy with the resolution and, thus, in his and his friends’ interests, he was merely coordinating the votes of shareholders to oppose the motions. Indeed, the First Accused argued that the fact that he had to coordinate proxy votes was indicative of his lack of influence over Asiasons because, if he had influence, he would have been able to prevent the resolutions from being tabled in the first place.

 I did not accept this. Not only was it inconsistent with his initial claim that he only had a “remote” connection with Asiasons, but it also missed the point entirely. The earlier emails showed clearly that the First Accused was concerned in deal-making within Asiasons and this showed, with equal clarity, that he was also concerned with other aspects of its management. As stated at [1165] above, one does not need to be at the apex of a company in order to be unlawfully concerned in its management as an undischarged bankrupt. That the First Accused was not able to stop the resolutions in question from coming out the gate at all, at best, would only have showed that the First Accused did not have absolute control over the company. It was not an answer to the allegation that he had been concerned in its management more generally.1185 Second, after the Crash, the First Accused exchanged a series of emails with Dato Kumar.

 These revealed discussions between the two about the potential fabrication and back-dating of appointment letters to create the impression that the First Accused had been appointed as an advisor to Asiasons. It appeared that this had been contemplated to justify his involvement therewith. It is useful to consider this portion of the email in full:

 Now to your position, this time I suggest we take this issue by the bull’s horn as it were. Before the claimants go on a counter attack, we will disclose that DJS is a consultant of Asiasons and Asiasons is advisor to the other companies. We can’t say you are consultant to all the companies (as that looks ridiculous). See if we can angle this. But there must be a fee paid to you for this either on retainer basis or success basis. I will back date a disclosure to OA in Shah Alam so this confirms the truth of it all.Dato’, I am suggesting this because if we are up front of your position the CAD/SGX can’t touch you.“DJS” referred to “Dato John Soh” and by “OA”, Dato Kumar meant the “Official Assignee”. Otherwise, the contents of and inferences to be drawn from this email needed no explanation.1186 By the above, I found that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the First Accused had been involved in the management of Asiasons. Primarily, his involvement was in the nature of deal-making. However, he was also involved in broader management concerns. Thus, the legal threshold set out at [1165] above had been crossed and I accordingly convicted the First Accused of Charge 180.Charge 181: Involvement in the management of LionGold1187 The Company Management Charge relating to LionGold read:That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 1 August 2012 and 3 October 2013, in Singapore, while being an undischarged bankrupt (having been adjudged bankrupt by a court in Malaysia having jurisdiction in bankruptcy), were concerned in the management of LionGold Corp Ltd, without leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 148(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50).1188 In respect of this charge, the most salient evidence came from Mr Nicholas Ng and Mr Chen. In general, they testified that the First Accused had substantial decision-making clout in the affairs of LionGold. Mr Nicholas Ng stated that the First Accused “called the shots” at meetings with the company’s directors.

 In the same vein, Mr Chen said that it was the First Accused who set the overall strategic direction of LionGold, decided on corporate deals, and made key decisions for the company. Indeed, Mr Chen even stated that “no acquisition deal would proceed without [the First Accused’s] approval”.

 It should be remembered that Mr Nicholas Ng was the CEO and Managing Director of LionGold, and Mr Chen was its Director of Business and Corporate Development. In the light of their senior positions within the company, their evidence carried particular weight. Thus, on the basis of Mr Nicholas Ng and Mr Chen’s testimonies alone, which I accepted, there was enough to conclude that the First Accused had been involved in the management of LionGold contrary to s 148(1) of the Companies Act.1189 However, the supporting evidence went considerably deeper. Numerous emails sent to and by the First Accused demonstrated the extent to which he had been involved in the management of LionGold. I set out a particularly probative example – one which illustrates not only the fact of the First Accused’s involvement, but the strong character of such involvement. 1190 On 13 March 2012, the First Accused had endorsed a deal in relation to a goldmine in Bolivia. In his own words, “Good to go. The risks are there but what the hell! lets do it” [sic].

 By November 2012, progress still had not been made in respect of this deal because the senior management team of LionGold expressed concerns about the deal. Thus, on 3 November 2012, the First Accused called for a meeting to “finalise the bolivia issues once and for all”.

1191 On 5 November 2012, one Mr Matthew Gill (“Mr Gill”), the COO of LionGold requested “structure and due process” with regard to the project, including a presentation and agreement by the “Technical Committee and M&A Team”, as well as a board meeting. About two hours after Mr Gill’s email, the First Accused responded to express his exasperation with what he perceived to be obstructive behaviour.

1192 However, on the same day, Mr Nicholas Ng came down on Mr Gill’s side and stated that the deal was a “project with too many contingent liabilities”, and that the team should “re-think” it before moving forward. On 6 November 2012, the First Accused then responded:

I am not crazy set on doing the deal. I am even saying if deal breakers can’t be solved, then we be decisive about it. But I am just put off by the fact that its been months and we been taking a luke warm approach to solving the issues. And when cy and philip actually takes the trouble to go there and come back with positive reports, everybody else just keep throwing up objections without attempting to seize the issues by the horns.Cy is normally very conservative, and she is firm that most of the issues can likely be resolved. She has been on the case for 4 mths. So why is her opinion not given weight?Next time we appoint some one to undertake a mission, let’s give their reports due weightage.Its as if every one wants to hear negative stuff about bolivia and is so so so bloody disappointed its not.I am ok to kill the project. But someone better be clear they can find a clearly better one to replace this.1193 This email clearly disclosed the strong character of the First Accused’s involvement in LionGold’s management. Indeed, if one were to view these exchanges without any context, one would almost certainly conclude that the First Accused sat at the top of the management team, or, at the very least, near its top. The Prosecution submitted that the First Accused had “no real defence”

Indeed, it also seemed starkly contrary to private messages he had sent to Mr Chen on the same day. In these messages, the First Accused criticised the other members of the management team and stated:

However, it, again, did not speak alone. The above email was consistent with several others which in my view, demonstrated that the First Accused had indeed played a key managerial role in LionGold.

 Thus, relying on such evidence, as well as the testimonies of Mr Nicholas Ng and Mr Chen, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the First Accused had been involved in the management of LionGold contrary to s 148(1) of the Companies Act and I convicted him of Charge 181 accordingly.Summary: The Company Management Charges1196 In sum, I found that the First Accused had been substantially involved in the management of Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold. As regards each of these three companies, the evidence revealed specifically that the First Accused had been substantially involved in the corporate deals and acquisitions they made. This certainly pushed his conduct over the threshold stated at [1165] above, and, thus, I convicted him of all three Company Management Charges. However, quite beyond this, this specific dimension of the First Accused’s involvement in the management of BAL stood strongly in support of the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons had a broader plan for their Scheme (see [850]–[881] above). The Witness Tampering Charges1197 I turn to the final group of charges. These pertained to the events which took place after the Scheme ground to a sharp halt, when the stock market for BAL shares crashed on 4 October 2013.1198 The Prosecution’s essential case was that during the course of investigations, the First Accused had specifically asked four witnesses, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Wong XY and Mr Chen, on eight occasions, to hide the truth about various aspects of the Scheme from the investigating authorities. On five of these occasions, the witnesses acted as instructed. In respect of these occasions, the First Accused faced five charges for intentionally perverting the course of justice under s 204A of the Penal Code.

 The substantive allegation made in each of these charges was distinct. As such, I will set them out in the paragraphs that follow, as I state my reasons for convicting the First Accused of each charge.1199 Similarly, the First Accused’s defence in respect of each charge was also distinct. However, his general response was to flatly deny these charges. On his account, Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Wong XY and Mr Chen were entirely untrustworthy witnesses, who had no qualms about lying.

 Third, in relation to the five charges pertaining to the completed offences under s 204A, the First Accused highlighted that the witnesses with whose evidence he had allegedly tampered ultimately testified against and incriminated him in their evidence. This, it was argued, should be construed in support of the conclusion that there was no tampering rather than the conclusion that there was tampering which eventually failed to be effective.

 Even on the Prosecution’s own case, what transpired was not witness tampering.It must also be emphasized that at the time of the alleged offences, it was not known to the [First] Accused that these individuals were going to be Prosecution witnesses. On the contrary, it was the [First] Accused’s belief that they were likely to be co-accused persons. It was in this context that the [First] Accused spoke to these witnesses about the ongoing investigations. There is nothing impermissible about co-accused persons discussing their potential defence, and this should not be readily construed as witness tampering.The applicable legal principles1201 Section 204A of the Penal Code provides: Obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating course of justice204A. Whoever intentionally obstructs, prevents, perverts or defeats the course of justice shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.[explanation omitted]For the avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that this was the applicable version of s 204A in-force at the time the First Accused allegedly committed the offences. Section 204A has since been repealed and re-enacted by s 59 of the CLRA 2019. The re-enacted provision “expand[s] the requisite mens rea element for the offence to be made out so as to include knowledge that the act done that has a tendency to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice is likely to have that effect” (see Parthiban a/l Kanapathy v Public Prosecutor [2021] 2 SLR 847 (“Parthiban a/l Kanapathy”) at [26]). However, as this was not the provision in issue before me, I will say nothing further on its scope. 1202 To constitute an offence under the version of s 204A with which this case was concerned, it had to be established that the accused in question did acts to either obstruct, prevent, pervert, or defeat the course of justice, and that such acts were carried out intentionally. In Seah Hock Thiam v Public Prosecutor [2013] SGHC 136 (“Seah Hock Thiam”), Choo Han Teck J observed at [6] that the words “obstructs”, “prevents”, “perverts” and “defeats” each “convey[ed] the legislative intention of casting slightly different shades of the same meaning”. As the charges set out below will show, the Prosecution opted in this case to use the phrase “pervert the course of justice”. Accordingly, it was this term with which this case was concerned.1203 I should also highlight the fact that since my decision on criminal liability was handed down on 5 May 2022 (see [7] above), there have been two notable decisions on the scope of s 204A. The first, Parthiban a/l Kanapathy, is a decision of the Court of Appeal. At [27(b)], the apex court helpfully articulated the broad categories of acts which constitute offences under s 204A:[W]hile the ways in which a court may become hampered or impaired in its capacity to do justice are of course manifold, offences under s 204A of the Penal Code may broadly be categorised into two groups: (i) first, situations where offenders seek to obstruct the course of justice by eradicating or fabricating evidence of their own wrongdoing or that of others, whether to conceal acts of another or of one’s own transgressions, such as suborning witnesses; and (ii) second, situations where offenders ask others to assume criminal responsibility voluntarily (see the decision of the District Court in Public Prosecutor v Aida Tay Ai Lin [2020] SGDC 157 at [42]). The express Parliamentary intention is for this provision to apply whether or not legal proceedings have already been instituted (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2197 (Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs)).The Witness Tampering Charges in this case fall within the first category.1204 The second decision, Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2022] 3 SLR 689 (“Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam”), is that of Tay Yong Kwang JCA sitting in the High Court. In this case, the issue arose as to whether, “as a matter of law, the predicate offence must have been identified by or known to the accused before a charge under s 204A could be made out” (at [53]). Answering this question firmly in the negative, Tay JCA stated at [83]–[84] and [88]–[89]:83  … It is apparent that s 204A does not state that an accused person must know about the particular charge(s) that might be brought against him or anyone else before he could be guilty under the section.84  In my view, if an accused person is aware or has reason to believe that some wrongdoing has been or may have been committed, whether by himself or by some other person(s), and consequently takes steps to somehow thwart or prevent the investigation into or the prosecution of the wrongdoing, he is guilty of an offence under s 204A. He does not need to know what specific offence may have been committed. He only needs to be aware of facts that may amount to wrongdoing, not the charges that may be preferred or the legal consequences that could flow from those facts.…88  If a person accused of a s 204A offence is proved to have been aware of the predicate offence at the time of his actions that intentionally obstruct the course of justice, this could be an aggravating factor in sentencing if the predicate offence is a very serious one. This is reiterated in the very recent decision of the Court of Appeal in [Parthiban a/l Kanapathy] at [26] and [27], delivered on 3 August 2021.89  However, the absence of knowledge of the precise predicate offence does not prevent a conviction under s 204A. I therefore reject the appellants’ arguments on the knowledge requirement.1205 It should be evident from the foregoing passages that neither Parthiban a/l Kanapathy nor Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam have varied the basic applicable principles. In establishing an offence under s 204A, the questions to be asked were, and they remain: (a) whether the accused person has done anything to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice; and (b) whether the accused person did those things intentionally.1206 Next, in respect of the three charges concerned with attempts, reference needs to be made to s 511 of the Penal Code: Punishment for attempting to commit offences511.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code or by any other written law with imprisonment or fine or with a combination of such punishments, or attempts to cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence, shall, where no express provision is made by this Code or by such other written law, as the case may be, for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with such punishment as is provided for the offence. …Illustrations(a) A makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box, and finds after so opening the box that there is no jewel in it. He has done an act towards the commission of theft, and therefore is guilty under this section.(b) A makes an attempt to pick the pocket of Z by thrusting his hand into Z’s pocket. A fails in the attempt in consequence of Z’s having nothing in his pocket. A is guilty under this section.1207 Once again, it should be highlighted that the above provision on attempts has been repealed and re-enacted by s 167 of the CLRA 2019. These amendments were significant. Prior to them being brought into force, there was no precise test to ascertain when an act or several acts crossed the boundary from being merely preparatory, into the realm of being a punishable attempt. In Chua Kian Kok v Public Prosecutor [1999] 1 SLR(R) 826 (“Chua Kian Kok”), Yong Pung How CJ suggested that the question to be asked was whether the accused had “embarked on the crime proper” (at [36]). In Public Prosecutor v Mas Swan bin Adnan [2012] 3 SLR 527 (“Mas Swan”), the Court of Appeal observed that there were four possible tests which could be used to lend greater clarity to the actus reus requirement for attempts. However, it declined to take a conclusive view on the issue on the grounds that, in the case before them, an attempt would be made out irrespective of the test that was applied (see [34]–[36]):34  The High Court in Chua Kian Kok took the view that the actus reus for the general offence of attempt was that the accused must have “embarked on the crime proper” (see Chua Kian Kok at [36]). The High Court preferred this rather vague formulation because it did not think it was desirable to provide a precise definition. The court felt that the precise point at which an act became an attempt was ultimately a question of fact (see Chua Kian Kok at [36]).35 The authors of a local textbook on criminal law have explained that a number of other approaches may be taken (see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012) (“Yeo”) at paras 36.14–36.24). The authors explain that it is clear that merely preparatory acts should not be sufficient (see Yeo at para 36.16). Beyond merely preparatory acts, various tests are possible:(a) One possibility is that only “acts immediately connected” with the commission of the primary offence constitute attempts (see Yeo at para 36.17 citing R v Eagleton (1855) Dears 376; 169 ER 766).(b) Another possibility is the “last act test”. This test provides that the accused must have done all that he believes to be necessary for the commission of the primary offence (see Yeo at para 36.19).(c) Yet another test is that the accused’s conduct must have been such as to “clearly and unequivocally indicate in itself the intention to commit the offence” (see Yeo at para 36.20).(d) A fourth possibility is the “substantial step” test, which requires the accused to have “progressed a substantial way towards the completion of the offence” (see Yeo at para 36.21). Interestingly, the authors point out that this test is embodied in the attempt provisions in two local statutes (see Yeo at para 36.21, referring to s 54(1) of the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42, 2001 Rev Ed) and s 38(1) of the Police Force Act (Cap 235, 2006 Rev Ed)). The authors prefer this fourth possibility (see Yeo at para 36.24).36 For the purposes of CCA 7/2011, it is not necessary for us to reach a conclusive view on the appropriate test to be adopted in the Singapore context. 1208 It is the “substantial step” formulation which has been adopted by the CLRA 2019 (see s 511(1) of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed)). To enhance certainty, s 511(2) lays down non-exhaustive examples of when an act might constitute a “substantial step”.1209 To be clear, none of these changes or observations means that the “substantial step” test is to be applied even in respect of charges premised on s 511 before the CLRA 2019. The inquiry to be pursued prior to the amendments was that stated in Chua Kian Kok, and, indeed, there was no dispute as to the law by the parties. 1210 Turning to the mens rea requirement for attempts, since Chua Kian Kok (at [31]), it has been clear that only an intention to commit the primary offence would suffice. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Mas Swan at [32]–[33] and has also been codified in the re-enacted s 511(1). Thus, the question to be answered in this case was whether the First Accused intended to commit the offences under s 204A.The charges pertaining to Mr Gan1211 The First Accused faced four charges in relation to Mr Gan. In general, Mr Gan gave evidence that the First Accused had met with him on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2016. According to Mr Gan, during these meetings, the First Accused updated him on the status of the investigations and informed him what the other TRs had told the authorities. This was allegedly done with a view to preparing Mr Gan for questions which might be asked during his interviews with the CAD. further, the First Accused had also allegedly asked Mr Gan to inform him about the matters on which Mr Gan had been questioned during those interviews, and what his answers to those questions had been.

 In support of their case, the Prosecution relied heavily on these audio recordings. The First Accused argued in response that the meetings were always initiated by Mr Gan, and the fact that Mr Gan made surreptitious recordings meant that what Mr Gan said during their conversations must be viewed with great suspicion. It is with this general context in mind that I turn to my reasons for deciding as I did on each charge.Charge 182: Mr Gan; incident in November 20141213 The first charge relating to Mr Gan read:CHARGE 182That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 20 and 27 November 2014, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Gan Tze Wee Gabriel to falsely inform the commercial Affairs Department that the Malaysian telephone number 60197726861 was not used by one Quah Su-Ling (“Quah”), and that Quah did not instruct the conduct of trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd through the accounts of one Lim Kuan Yew and one Nelson Fernandez, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.1214 On the evidence of Mr Gan, during his second interview with the CAD on 20 November 2014, he admitted that the Second Accused had used the 6861

 That night, Mr Gan then called the First Accused to update him about what had transpired. The First Accused instructed Mr Gan to change his statement, and to lie that he could not confirm whether the number had been used by the Second Accused. He had told Mr Gan that he should say that someone else, such as Mr Lim KY’s friend or secretary, was the one who had used this number to contact him. Further, the First Accused had also told Mr Gan to maintain the stance that the Second Accused had not given any trading instructions for the accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez, and that these two accountholders had given Mr Gan the discretion to trade in their accounts.

In that statement, Mr Gan “clarif[ied]” that he could not be certain whether the phone number had in fact been used by the Second Accused, and that he had earlier “assumed” that she had been the caller.

Question 251Please explain why you assumed [the Second Accused] was the one calling you from 60197726861.AnswerThis number was given to me by [Mr Lim KY]. If I remember correctly, [Mr Lim KY] had called me from the number 60123123611 before and asked me to send information on my clients’ outstanding position in Asiasons, Blumont and Lion[G]old to the numbers 60197726861 and 60123123611.He did not say who was the user of the number 60197726861 and I did not ask him further. However, I remembered [the Second Accused] was predominantly trading in ThinkEnvironment[al] (now known as Lion[G]old) when she was my client in AmFraser and this was also the counter [Mr Lim KY] was trading heavily in. And subsequently [Mr Lim KY] asked for such information relating to the counter; and the number 60197726861 called me before which was a female caller. So I assumed that it was [the Second Accused]. Based on what I recall, I had never asked the caller whether she is indeed [the Second Accused].1216 The Prosecution submitted that the explanation added by Mr Gan to account for his change of position was “contrived”.

 I agreed. Nothing about Mr Gan’s explanation was logical. The fact that the Second Accused had been Mr Gan’s client at some point in the past, coupled with the fact that Mr Lim KY and the Second Accused both traded in Think Environmental before it became “LionGold”, offered no explanation as to why he would assume it was the Second Accused who was calling him using the 6861 number. 1217 Indeed, given the terms in which Mr Gan’s gave his answers on 20 November 2014, his revisions on 27 November 2014 were all the more puzzling. On 20 November 2014, he stated:

{Interview was paused from 16:15 to 16:30 for interviewee to take a smoke break}Question 217: Do you have anything further to say for your above answers?Answer: I would like to say that the number 60197726861 was indeed used by [the Second Accused]. I had not wanted to be implicated in this case further so I had said that the number was not used by her. But now I would like to say that she had used this number to contact me for the purpose of finding out the outstanding positions in Asiasons, Blumont and Lion[G]old held by my clients. She told me that she was doing some sort of block deal so she is interested to know such information. I confirm that she had not called me to place trades in any of my clients’ accounts at all before. However, from my memory, this has not been going on for a very long time. I do not recall when exactly [the Second Accused] began asking me for such information but it started sometime last year.Question 218: How did you know that it was [the Second Accused] who called you from the number?Answer: From what I can recall, the caller did not identify herself before but I recognized the voice as [the Second Accused’s] and assumed that it should be her.…Question 221: Previously you said these numbers could belong to [Mr Lim KY] and [Mr Fernandez]. So this is not the case?Answer: Yes, I confirm this is not the case. [emphasis in italics added]1218 It was readily apparent that Mr Gan was certain when he gave these answers. In fact, his answer to question 217 was particularly revealing given that it was given not only after a 15-minute break, but in response to an open-ended rather than a targeted question. The CAO interviewing Mr Gan had not asked him about the 6861 number, yet, Mr Gan offered information that it certainly belonged to the Second Accused, and, further, explained that he had previously said otherwise for fear of being implicated in whatever misconduct was being investigated. In light of these answers he gave on 20 November 2014, Mr Gan’s shift in position on 27 November 2014 would likely have done little more than to make him appear somewhat dishonest to the investigators. It was hardly in his interest to revise his answers in that manner. 1219 Further, beyond Mr Gan’s testimony and the above analysis as regards whether it was logical for Mr Gan to initiate his change of position from 20 to 27 November 2014 as he did, Mr Gan’s evidence was also supported by the audio recordings mentioned at [1212] above. 1220 On or about 4 April 2016, Mr Gan spoke to the First Accused and informed him that he had been called up for further interviews by the authorities. Thereafter, the conversation proceeded as follows:

Mr Gan: First day was repeat question … the two numbers … jit eh [one] wu yi eh [got his/her] number [inaudible, 05:09 – 05:10] ling wa jit eh Su Ling eh [another belonged to Su Ling]. So I told him … Su Ling one why I change statement … it’s not because I change statement… it was because the CAD officer told me it was Quah Su Ling’s number. And I didn’t know the identity of the lady. Because Kuan Yew just say friend, so I just assume friend lah. I didn’t know it’s Quah Su Ling. So since the CAD officer say it’s Quah Su Ling so I just assume it’s Quah Su Ling. So next day I say that I cannot be sure that it’s Quah Su Ling. Because it’ll be committing perjury. Must go to court. Dio bo [correct]? So that’s why I change. Really ah, he said. So later he deleted lah… he made some amendment, say female voice. He said it’s a female voice. Not assumed to be Quah Su Ling. Before that it was always assumed to be.First Accused: Very good.…1222 It is relevant to highlight that in the two statements recorded by the CAD from Mr Gan on 6 and 11 April 2016, the investigator did in fact shift from referring to the user of the 6861 number as the Second Accused, and, instead, simply recorded its user as a “female voice”.

1223 When the First Accused was cross-examined as to these recorded conversations, he began with an explanation that he was frustrated because Mr Gan had been “badgering” him. By the First Accused’s rough count, Mr Gan had called him around 300 times asking “really stupid questions”, but he had only responded around 45 times. On this footing, the First Accused went on to emphasise two salient points. First, that he did not know the answers which Mr Gan had given the CAD.

 By this, I understood the First Accused to mean that, when he said “possible, possible”, or “very good”, these words were not to be taken as expressing any substantive meaning or, indeed, any understanding of the statements being made by Mr Gan. Rather, those words were merely polite, albeit disinterested, verbal acknowledgements of Mr Gan speaking. 1224 In my judgment, the First Accused’s defence (including the more general aspects set out at [1199] above) was plainly unbelievable. My reasons for this view follow.(a) First of all, as I stated at [1218] above, Mr Gan’s shift from the position he took in 20 November 2014 statement to that in his 27 November 2014 was illogical if it had been brought about by Mr Gan’s own initiative. If Mr Gan’s objective was purely self-preservation – which it evidently was – this was not a sensible means by which that was to be achieved. Indeed, Mr Gan was aware of this lack of sense. During his conversation with the First Accused on or around 4 April 2016, despite around one and a half years having passed since the November 2014 statements, one of the potential reasons Mr Gan speculated for his further interviews was the fact that he had “flipped” in relation to the user of the 6861 number. That such a concern operated on his mind suggested to me that Mr Gan was astute enough to realise that his change in position was unfavourable to him.(b) Second, although I could accept that Mr Gan may have decided to change his position based on an error of judgment in terms of how that change might affect the credibility of his account as perceived by the investigators, this was highly unlikely when considered alongside: (i) the fact that Mr Gan was telling and later updating the First Accused about his April 2016 interviews at all; (ii) Mr Gan’s clear evidence that the First Accused had instructed him to revise the position taken in his 20 November 2014 statement; (iii) the First Accused’s concession that he was aware the Second Accused had used the 6861 number at least in the second half of 2013, albeit, according to him, not exclusively;

 and (iv) the fact the words used by the First Accused, understood in light of the foregoing concession, conveyed approval, not merely disinterested acknowledgement.(c) Third, even if the First Accused’s general case had been accepted, and I had approached Mr Gan’s evidence with the degree of scepticism the First Accused suggested I should have, this was an oddly specific and arguably meaningless allegation for Mr Gan to fabricate. Once again, if Mr Gan’s goal was self-preservation, that objective would have been served by ensuring the investigating authorities gathered all they needed in respect of the ‘big ticket’ offences so to speak. It would hardly have been fruitful for Mr Gan to set out to additionally implicate the First Accused in matters beyond the central financial offences. 1225 For these reasons, I determined that the First Accused had, sometime between 20 and 27 November 2014, instructed Mr Gan to lie in relation to the Second Accused’s use of the 6861 number, and her role in giving trading instructions. I found that the First Accused did so with the intent to frustrate the ongoing investigations, and thus to pervert the course of justice. I also did not find the First Accused’s alternative argument set out at [1200] above persuasive. While the First Accused would not have known for certain whether Mr Gan was going to be a witness for the Prosecution, it did not follow that there was nothing impermissible about his conduct. Whether the First Accused caused a potential co-accused or possible witness for the Prosecution to lie, this would have been sufficient to make out an offence under s 204A of the Penal Code (see [1202] above). I was therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 182 against the First Accused was made out and I convicted him accordingly.Charge 183: Mr Gan; incident in December 20151226 The second charge relating to Mr Gan read:CHARGE 183That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime in December 2015, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Gan Tze Wee Gabriel, if he was questioned by the investigating authorities, to deny everything he knew about your involvement in the trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through the accounts of one Lim Kuan Yew and one Nelson Fernandez, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.1227 Preliminarily, Mr Gan stated that the incident to which this charge related took place around 17 December 2015 in LionGold’s office.

 the First Accused had brought up the topic of investigations. The First Accused prepared Mr Gan for the possibility that Mr Tai had provided some evidence incriminating the First Accused and Mr Gan to the authorities. Specifically, the First Accused said:

The position he was instructed to adopt was that Mr Tai was “delusional” and was, in truth, the one who had manipulated the markets for and prices of BAL shares. This was described by the First Accused as “our stand”. The conversation proceeded as follows:

(b) Second, when he was asked about an earlier answer he had given wherein he stated that it was “possible” that the user of the 3611 number was the First Accused (see [197]–[198] above), Mr Gan dialled back. His earlier response was based on the fact that the First Accused and Mr Lim KY were associates. However, when asked about the same possibility on 6 April 2016 – that was, the possibility of the First Accused being the user of the 3611 number – Mr Gan said, “Yes, that is possible. From what I gathered from the media. I read reports and charts linking John Soh to Lim Kuan Yew”.

It could be a male associate or friend of Lim Kuan Yew”.

 This, again, similarly sought to toss up the possibility that the caller was some other unknown male individual, rather than the First Accused.1231 These statements were, as I have found above, untrue. The two accounts, contrary to what Mr Gan had stated in these statements, were under the control of the accused persons (see [704]–[715] above).1232 The First Accused’s explanation of the recorded conversation did not answer the allegations and was, in fact, wholly unbelievable. He claimed that the background to this conversation was as follows. One “Colonel Tan”, purportedly Mr Tai’s godfather, had approached him after the Crash. Referring to TRs such as Mr Tai, Mr Tjoa and Mr Gan, Colonel Tan had apparently asked the First Accused to “get some semblance of peace between everybody”.

 In pursuit of such “peace”, the First Accused claimed that he was simply telling Mr Gan about some of the “fanciful” stories Mr Tai had been telling. Such stories, the First Accused suggested, showed that Mr Tai was “delusional”.1233 By calling to attention how “fanciful” these stories were, the First Accused explained that he was simply attempting to “calm [Mr Gan’s] fears” as Mr Gan had told him that Mr Tai had been “going around talking about his and Henry’s involvement”. To explain his suggestion that Mr Gan “deny everything”, the First Accused stated that this was simply “a common sense textbook answer” because Mr Tai’s position was not the truth, and both he and Gabriel knew it was not the truth.

1234 This explanation was completely contradicted by the contents of the conversation. It was the First Accused, not Mr Gan, who had raised the issue of Mr Tai potentially having provided the authorities with incriminating evidence. Mr Gan had not expressed any fears about this to the First Accused, and in fact learned about Mr Tai’s position from the First Accused. Also, it was the First Accused who had tried to prepare Mr Gan on how he should respond if he were to be questioned on this matter at subsequent interviews. By using the phrase “our stand” during the conversation, it was clearly the First Accused’s intention for Mr Gan to align himself with the First Accused against Mr Tai.1235 For these reasons, I found that the First Accused had intentionally tampered with Mr Gan’s evidence to the investigating authorities by asking him to deny the First Accused’s role in the trading activities of BAL shares in the accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez held with DMG & Partners under the management of Mr Gan. In my judgment, the First Accused did so with the intent to frustrate the ongoing investigations against the accused persons, and thus to pervert the course of justice. Thus, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 183 against the First Accused was made out and I convicted him accordingly.Charge 184: Mr Gan; incident on 4 April 20161236 The third charge relating to Mr Gan read:CHARGE 184That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime on or about 4 April 2016, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Gan Tze Wee Gabriel (“Gan”) to falsely inform the Monetary Authority of Singapore that you and Quah Su-Ling were not involved in the trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd through the accounts of one Lim Kuan Yew and one Nelson Fernandez, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.1237 According to Mr Gan, the incident which formed the subject of the above charge took place on or about 4 April 2016. To begin, Mr Gan had informed the First Accused that he had upcoming interviews with the MAS on 6 and 11 April 2016.

1238 In respect of this conversation, Mr Gan testified that the First Accused had prepared him for various lines of questioning. These included the phone numbers that were used to contact Mr Gan before orders were placed in the Relevant Accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez, whether the accused persons operated out of a trading room on the ground floor of the LionGold’s office, and whether Mr Gan had attended a briefing a week before the Crash. In respect of each of these lines, the First Accused had told Mr Gan to disclaim knowledge and keep up his lies to conceal the accused persons’ involvement in the use of the two accounts. According to Mr Gan, he did as he was instructed, and accordingly denied that the accused persons had been involved in the BAL trading activities in his subsequent statements dated 6 and 11 April 2016. I set out the salient portions of the transcribed recording and Mr Gan’s explanations thereon.

First, he understood the statement “they are trying hard to find an angle” as meaning that MAS was still searching for evidence of his involvement in BAL’s trading activities. By contrast, “Charlie buay tong liao” meant that the CAD had stopped searching because it could not sustain their investigations against him.

 Thus, Mr Gan understood the statement “stick to your usual stupid answers” as instructions by the First Accused to claim, in his interviews with the MAS, that he either could not remember events during the Relevant Period, or to deny the accused persons’ involvement.

1240 At [1230] above, I have set out some of the obstructive answers Mr Gan had given during his interview on 6 April 2016 to conceal and deny the First Accused’s involvement. As stated at [1231], those statements were untrue. During that interview, Mr Gan also denied that the “female voice” who called him using the 6861 number had influenced the trades he had executed in Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez’s accounts.

 These answers were also untrue. As I have found, the Second Accused had been involved in giving trading instructions to Mr Gan. Mr Gan also gave untrue answers during his interview on 11 April 2016. For example, during this interview, he stated that he did not receive any calls from the female user of the 6861 number in respect of payment arrangements for Mr Lim KY’s account.

 This, however, was untrue. 1241 In his defence, the First Accused generally claimed that he had not instructed Mr Gan to do anything. Instead, when he said “stick to your usual stupid answers”, the First Accused was responding in an exasperated manner to the “constant, relentless stupid questions” that Mr Gan had been asking him. On this, the First Accused stated that Mr Gan was being an “irritant” and, in retrospect, it was clear that Mr Gan was trying to “bait” him by getting him to make seemingly incriminatory statements whilst making secret recordings.

1242 The First Accused’s explanations were totally untenable. In the first place, it was he who raised the topic of the investigations. The First Accused was the one who had informed Mr Gan that the MAS was still trying to gather evidence against him despite the CAD having apparently given up. Following that, the First Accused had told Mr Gan directly: “you just stick to your usual stupid answers”, because in that way, the authorities would not be able to “crack it”. There was absolutely no sign of Mr Gan asking “constant, relentless, stupid questions”, or any evidence of Mr Gan trying to “bait” the First Accused. On the contrary, on a commonsensical reading of the conversation which transpired, it was obvious that the First Accused was the one who was raising areas for discussion, suggesting answers that Mr Gan should adopt and endorsing the false answers Mr Gan had offered. 1243 Accordingly, I found that the First Accused had intentionally tampered with Mr Gan’s evidence to the investigating authorities by asking him to deny the accused persons’ involvement in the trading activities of BAL shares in the accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez held with DMG & Partners. In arriving at this conclusion, I was mindful that the First Accused did not specifically direct Mr Gan to deny the involvement of the Second Accused. However, it was clear from Mr Gan’s interview on 11 April 2016 that he did in fact do so. In my judgment, this was sufficient to infer that implicit in the areas discussed during the conversation, was an understanding that the “usual stupid answers” Mr Gan was to give pertained to both the First and Second Accused. Indeed, as I have found at [1213]–[1225] in connection with Charge 182, the First Accused had earlier instructed Mr Gan to cast doubt on whether the Second Accused was the user of the 6861 number. Such an implicit understanding was therefore supported by the broader context of their interactions. I was thus satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 184 against the First Accused was made out and I convicted him accordingly.Charge 185: Mr Gan; incident on 15 April 20161244 The final charge relating to Mr Gan read:CHARGE 185That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime on or about 15 April 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Gan Tze Wee Gabriel to feign ignorance to the investigating authorities as to why Quah Su-Ling and Neo Kim Hock were paying for trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through the accounts of one Lim Kuan Yew and one Nelson Fernandez, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.[emphasis added]1245 According to Mr Gan, this fourth instance of tampering took place on or about 15 April 2016.

1246 During this conversation, Mr Gan informed the First Accused that the investigators had shown him a schedule kept by Mr Goh HC which appeared to track the trading losses in various Relevant Accounts (ie, Mr Goh HC’s Spreadsheet: see [751] above). In response, the First Accused told Mr Gan that if he were to be subsequently asked again about payments that he received from third parties such as Mr Neo and the Second Accused for BAL trades in the accounts of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez, he should feign ignorance and tell the investigators to ask persons in Malaysia such as Mr Neo, Mr Lim KY or Mr Fernandez themselves.

As such, he did not have to give false answers as instructed by the First Accused.

 When asked to explain what he said during the conversation, the First Accused’s defence was that it was “a set-up” by Mr Gan and that he had no knowledge of these payment arrangements. In fact, he claimed that by telling Mr Gan to “push to KL”, he was actually asking Mr Gan to tell the truth.

 1249 Such an interpretation of the conversation was quite fanciful. When one considered the tone of the exchange and the actual words used, it was clear that the First Accused had been coaching Mr Gan on how to respond to the investigators in a manner which would not implicate the accused persons. As I have discussed, the evidence showed that the accused persons had taken responsibility for the payment arrangements for losses suffered in numerous Relevant Accounts, including those of Mr Lim KY and Mr Fernandez under the management of Mr Gan. In this light, it could be concluded that, in order to conceal their involvement, the First Accused had instructed Mr Gan to point the arrow at his Malaysian associates who were out of the investigators’ jurisdiction. By these instructions, the First Accused had certainly embarked on the crime proper, and I was thus satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 185 against the First Accused was made out. I convicted him accordingly.The charges pertaining to Mr Tai1250 On the Prosecution case, after the Crash, it was the First Accused’s general plan to cast Mr Tai as the “fall guy”, both in criminal investigations by the CAD and MAS, as well as in civil claims by IB.

 It was against this background that two Witness Tampering Charges had been brought against the First Accused in connection with Mr Tai.1251 This plan was underscored by two key meetings at which the foundations were laid for Mr Tai to be the “fall guy”.(a) The first took place sometime in November or December 2013. Mr Chen gave evidence that, around this time, a meeting took place in Malaysia among several Relevant Accountholders to discuss how they were to respond to legal proceedings IB had brought against them both in Singapore and in Malaysia. The accountholders present at this meeting were Mr Tan BK, Mr Neo, Mr Lee CH, and Mr Chen. Also present at this meeting was Dato Kumar. At this meeting, Dato Kumar presented a line of defence to account for Mr Tai’s BAL trading activities leading up to the Crash. The gist of this was that Mr Tai had entered into a commission-generating scheme with Mr Swanson. Pursuant to this, Mr Tai supposedly carried out a high volume of trades which the Relevant Accountholders did not authorise. This, Mr Chen suggested, was to be the group’s defence in the legal proceedings commenced by IB.

 (b) The second meeting took place in December 2013. Mr Tai testified that he had met the First Accused around this time to discuss ways to avoid repaying IB the losses suffered in the 11 Relevant Accounts as a result of the Crash. During this discussion, the First Accused apparently asked Mr Tai to prepare a statutory declaration stating that he had used the 11 Relevant Accounts held with IB to “churn” trades so as to generate trading volume and, therefore, commissions for himself and IB. The First Accused had instructed Mr Tai to allege in this declaration that the churning had been carried out on the request of Mr Swanson and,

 further, that Mr Swanson had actually been the one who asked Mr Tai to forge signatures for the Relevant Accountholders in order to open IB accounts for them, without their authorisation.

1252 Mr Chen and Mr Tai’s accounts of these concurrent events were supported by a contemporaneous email sent by Dato Kumar to the First Accused on 9 November 2013. This email, which was also referred to at [1185] above, covered numerous topics. Central to these two Witness Tampering Charges was the following statement: “The first suit I will launch is the IB suits. I will be ready in a week to nail it as that is the strongest case we have with Ken’s disclosures. I will need an SD [statutory declaration] from him prepared by your lawyers in Singapore. Maybe you can sort this out for me” [emphasis added].

 This corroborated why the First Accused had approached Mr Tai and asked him to prepare a statutory declaration as described above.1253 The fact that Mr Tai’s statutory declaration was designed to fraudulently concoct untruths to avoid liability was particularly evident from an email sent by Dato Kumar to the First Accused on 12 December 2013. In this email, Dato Kumar wrote to the First Accused:

Dato’,To add, Ken Tai’s statement also will have to omit Sun Spirit + Su-Lin as we want him to say he traded without the knowledge of the defendants. This wouldn’t apply for Su-Lin and Sun Spirit as in the UK Suit there is admission that they traded Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold. I dunno how this happen in The UK suit, but their defence position is severely compromised. I just got the suit today from Palmer. I just want to highlight this in advance.1254 This email showed clearly that unforeseen “mishaps” had put a wrench in the First Accused, Dato Kumar, and the Relevant Accountholders’ plans to set Mr Tai up as the “fall guy” for all the accounts held with IB. Indeed, that such a variation in the group’s position had to be taken at all pointed to the plain and obvious conclusion that there was probably nothing about the planned defence which was authentic. The First Accused did not have a real explanation for the fact of these plans save to downplay his involvement.

 This was not tenable. The most incriminating emails from Dato Kumar had been addressed to the First Accused, who certainly either devised or sanctioned the plan. In any case, ultimately, the statutory declaration was of no use to the group. Indeed, Mr Tai decided in April 2015 that it was “not worth being [the First Accused’s] fall-guy”. Thus, Mr Tai “c[a]me clean and [told] the truth to the CAD”.

 This, however, still left the question of why Mr Tai had been willing to take the fall for the First Accused in the first place.1255 On Mr Tai’s account, there were four essential reasons why he had initially agreed to take responsibility for the IB losses and even potential criminal proceedings. First, he felt a “strong sense of indebtedness and gratitude to [the accused persons]” as they both helped him through a very difficult period of his life after he left his job with Kim Eng Securities in “acrimonious circumstances” sometime in April 2010. In fact, their trades in the IB and Saxo accounts were the “main source” of his livelihood in 2012 and 2013.

 Second, the First Accused had essentially promised Mr Tai S$2 million. This sum represented personal monies Mr Tai had with IB which IB had been withholding. On Mr Tai’s evidence, the First Accused “promised to underwrite” this sum.

 Third, the First Accused had apparently informed Mr Tai that the longest sentence served for market manipulation in Singapore was only two years, referring to the Pan-Electric Industries Limited case in the 1980s. Therefore, the likely sentence Mr Tai would face would not be a heavy one.

1256 The foregoing background was salient. Although the two Witness Tampering Charges concerning Mr Tai did not specifically relate to the plan to make Mr Tai the “fall guy” generally, the periods to which the two charges relate were in the midst of the period when such a plan was still live, prior to Mr Tai’s decision in April 2015 to come clean. It was during this period, ie, after December 2013 until April 2015, that Mr Tai said he had given false information to the CAD pursuant to specific instructions from the First Accused to do so. Whether such specific instructions had been given necessarily needed to be considered. Nevertheless, they were usefully seen in the wider context of the broader plan to make Mr Tai the “fall guy”. 1257 With that in mind, I turn to the two charges.Charge 186: Mr Tai; incident in December 20131258 The first charge relating to Mr Tai read:CHARGE 186That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime in December 2013, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Tai Chee Ming, if he was questioned by the investigating authorities, to falsely conceal your and Quah Su-Ling’s involvement in the trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through trading accounts opened with Saxo Bank A/S and Interactive Brokers LLC, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.1259 In respect of this charge, Mr Tai’s evidence was that sometime in December 2013, he had met the First Accused together with Mr Tjoa at LionGold’s office. The purpose of the meeting was for them to ask about the settlement of trading losses in the Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and Phillip Securities. On Mr Tai’s evidence, he “did not really care” about the losses suffered in the accounts held with IB because the FI was “behaving very aggressively and had even withheld his personal money”. However, he still felt “morally responsible in some way” for Saxo’s losses, particularly because one Mr Lars Hornsleth of Saxo, with whom Mr Tai had a good relationship, stood to lose his job unless the losses were recovered.

1260 At this meeting, the First Accused, Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa had also discussed rumours that the CAD had begun investigating the cause of the Crash. On this note, Mr Tai testified that the First Accused specifically told them that if they were called up for investigations, they should exclude the accused persons from any involvement in the accounts under their management. Instead, for Mr Tai, he was to say that he had the discretion to trade based on standing instructions from the Relevant Accountholders. This, the First Accused said, was not a problem for Mr Tai who did in fact hold LPOAs to trade in each of the Saxo and IB accounts.

 Mr Tai complied. In 14 statements he had given to the CAD between 2 April 2014 and 14 April 2015, Mr Tai claimed that most of the trades in the Saxo and IB accounts were placed on his own initiative; that the clients had given him the discretion to trade; and that he had carried out churning activities in order to generate commissions. Mr Tai explained that he decided to say that he had carried out churning in these accounts because there were no calls from the accountholders to him with trading instructions, and he had no other means to explain the unusual trading pattern which arose from the accused persons’ market rolling activities.

1261 I set out an example from Mr Tai’s first statement to the CAD, recorded on 2 April 2014. When asked whether the Relevant Accountholders with IB accounts had been aware that Mr Tai had the discretion to place trades in their accounts. Mr Tai answered that he did not know, but, in any event, that he did not conduct “discretionary trades” in those clients’ accounts.

  KT-27, Question 94.



Question: Can you confirm that you have not conducted any discretionary trades in your clients’ [IB] accounts before? Which means that all the trades conducted in your clients’ accounts are specifically instructed by your clients?Answer (Mr Tai): Ok I will like to clarify. Not all of the trades conducted in the [IB] account[s] are instructed by my clients. Some are conducted on my own accord. But I have consulted my clients beforehand. The reason for conducting these trades is because I need to generate commission for [IB]. If I do not generate enough commission for [IB], they will clamp down on the margin requirements for my clients. That is what was specifically told to me by Neil Swanson of [IB]. Specifically, Neil Swanson told me to generate the commission and he will take care of the margin requirements. So in order to generate commission for [IB], I have to churn the accounts. By churning, I mean buying and selling shares in the same counter on the same day at around the same price. Since [IB] will earn a commission on each trade conducted by clients, they will stand to benefit if there are a high level of trading activity in my clients’ accounts.But I need to state that all my clients are aware that I will be conducting churning in their accounts. They allowed me to do to so because the commission charged by [IB] is not very high to begin with. Furthermore, they do not want [IB] to clamp down on the margin requirements. So if they have to incur commission on churning in order to keep [IB] happy and prevent them from tightening the margin requirements, they are willing to do so.1262 In respect of the Saxo accounts, Mr Tai informed the CAD:

  KT-28, Questions 128–131.



 Question: So do you conduct trades in your clients’ SAXO accounts at your own discretion?Answer (Mr Tai): Yes sometimes.Question: Can you please elaborate?Answer (Mr Tai): Whenever my clients call and place orders with me in their Saxo [account], I will execute their orders accordingly. As for the remaining instances, I will sometimes make the decision on what trades to be conducted in these clients’ account[s] without their instructions.Question: For the discretionary trades, how then do you decide on the trades to conduct in your clients’ account[s]?Answer (Mr Tai): No specific manner. Whenever I feel like conducting a trade, I will conduct a trade.Question: Didn’t your clients give you at least some scope or mandate as to how your discretionary trades should be conducted?Answer (Mr Tai): They are fine with any trades decided by me, so long as I do not trade in the company’s shares during the black our period, i.e. when the company is about to release an announcement. 1263 Mr Tai’s answers were, given my decision in respect of the issue of the accused persons’ control of the IB accounts (see [688] above), plainly untrue. Indeed, they also shrouded the accused persons’ involvement behind a layer of potentially legitimate discretionary trades. 1264 And, when viewed in the broader context of the First Accused’s plan to make, and Mr Tai’s willingness to be made, the “fall guy”, Mr Tai’s false answers to the CAD were, in my view, a product of the First Accused’s tampering. In this connection, I accepted Mr Tai’s evidence and I rejected the First Accused’s contention that he was not a witness of credit. Thus, on this footing, I found that the First Accused had intentionally tampered with Mr Tai’s evidence to the investigating authorities by asking him to falsely conceal the First Accused’s role in the trading activities of BAL shares in the Relevant Accounts held with Saxo and IB. In my judgment, the First Accused did so with the intent to pervert the course of justice by frustrating the ongoing investigations against the accused persons; thus, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 186 against the First Accused was made out and I convicted him accordingly. For completeness, I should note that, for the same reasons set out at [1225] above in relation to Mr Gan, I also did not accept the First Accused’s general argument (see [1200] above) that there was nothing impermissible about his conduct because he did not know whether Mr Tai would be a witness for the Prosecution.Charge 187: Mr Tai; incident between January and April 20151265 The second charge relating to Mr Tai read:CHARGE 187That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between January and April 2015, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by providing one Tai Chee Ming with the notes that you took of what you had informed the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) when questioned by the CAD during investigations into your involvement in the trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through trading accounts opened with Saxo Bank A/S and Interactive Brokers LLC (“your record”), and asking him, if he was questioned by the investigating authorities, to give them a version of events consistent with your record, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.[emphasis added]1266 According to Mr Tai, sometime in the first quarter of 2015, the First Accused had given him a document setting out the contents of a statement given by the First Accused to the CAD, drafted based on his recollection.

 However, he denied telling Mr Tai to “sing to the tune” of the statement. He suggested that Mr Tai had lied. To that end, the First Accused pointed out that there were aspects of Mr Tai’s evidence which were illogical. For example, Mr Tai’s evidence was that the First Accused had asked him, during the same conversation where he had been handed the aforementioned document, to “run down the credibility” of certain individuals. One of these individuals was Ms Chua. To this, the First Accused stated in court that it was not sensible for him to have asked Mr Tai to do such a thing when Mr Tai was not even acquainted with Ms Chua.

 1268 While I understood the point the First Accused was seeking to make, it did not answer the fundamental allegation made against him in Charge 187. He did not answer why he had drafted the statement he had given the CAD from memory and, more importantly, why he had handed it to Mr Tai at all. The First Accused did not explain his position at all. The fact that Mr Tai had this document in his possession was revealing. Coupled with his testimony (which I accepted) and the fact that Mr Tai was even willing to accept the fall for the First Accused (see [1255] above), there was enough evidence to conclude that the First Accused had embarked on the crime proper, and that Charge 187 was made out. Accordingly, I convicted the First Accused. Charge 188: Mr Chen; incident in April 20141269 The Witness Tampering Charge relating to Mr Chen read:CHARGE 188That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime on or after 2 April 2014, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Peter Chen Hing Woon (“Chen”) to falsely inform the Commercial Affairs Department that you were not involved in the trades in the securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through Chen’s trading accounts, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.[emphasis added]1270 To begin, I reiterate my finding that Mr Chen was generally a witness of credit (see [218]–[225] above). On this footing, I set out his evidence. In connection with the allegation made in the charge, Mr Chen testified that on 2 April 2014, he had met the First Accused at LionGold’s office. At this meeting, the First Accused allegedly informed Mr Chen that he had “people on the inside”, which Mr Chen took to refer to the CAD, MAS and SGX. He allegedly suggested that he would know what was disclosed to the authorities and told Mr Chen to put a buffer between him and the Relevant Accounts held in Mr Chen’s name. The First Accused further told Mr Chen that he was not to admit to the authorities that he was the First Accused’s nominee.1271 The First Accused then allegedly informed Mr Chen that, if he were to implicate the First Accused, the First Accused’s lawyers would “tear [Mr Chen] down”. Mr Chen perceived this to be a threat and feared reprisal, given the First Accused’s connections and resources. Indeed, previously, Mr Chen himself had personally been asked by the First Accused to convey a threat to someone, and he understood the significance of the threat made to him. Mr Chen’s evidence was corroborated by various witnesses including Mr Tai,

1272 In his defence, the First Accused sought to attack Mr Chen’s credibility, primarily in connection with the more central evidence he gave regarding the accused persons’ use of his 14 Relevant Accounts. On the basis Mr Chen’s evidence was generally not to be accepted, the First Accused submitted that his account in respect of this Witness Tampering Charge was simply “not believable” and “inherently incredible”. Indeed, if the First Accused had in fact “threatened” Mr Chen and stated that he had a mole in the CAD, or any other investigating authority, it made no sense that the First Accused then took no steps after Mr Chen incriminated the First Accused in his statements to the CAD.

1273 As I had rejected the accused persons’ claim that they had not been in control of the Relevant Accounts in Mr Chen’s name, the First Accused’s main response to this charge fell away. Mr Chen’s evidence was not inherently incredible in light of my findings on the False Trading, Price Manipulation, Deception, Cheating, and Company Management Charges. As regards the second argument that the First Accused probably did not make any threats in the first place as he had not executed any of the supposed threats despite the fact that Mr Chen had incriminated the First Accused, I found this argument to be a non sequitur. Whether the First Accused actually had a mole in the CAD, MAS or other agency, was not the point. The point was that the First Accused had said that he did to Mr Chen (and, also others: see [1271] above). 1274 I was satisfied on the evidence of Mr Chen that the First Accused had in fact made such a threat in furtherance of directions for Mr Chen to suppress the truth that the First Accused had been involved in the BAL trades executed in the Relevant Accounts held in Mr Chen’s name. The giving of such directions was certainly enough to satisfy the elements of an attempt under s 511 of the Penal Code (see [1209]–[1210] above), particularly when seen alongside the fact of the First Accused’s threat. I therefore found that Charge 188 was made out and convicted the First Accused accordingly. Once again, for completeness, for the same reasons stated at [1225], I also did not accept the First Accused’s argument (set out at [1200] above) that there was nothing impermissible about his conduct because he did not know whether Mr Chen would be a witness for the Prosecution.Charge 189: Mr Wong XY; incident in April 20141275 The Witness Tampering Charge relating to Mr Wong XY read:CHARGE 189That you, Soh Chee Wen, sometime between 11 and 23 April 2014, at Park Hotel, located at 1 Unity Street, Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, to wit, by asking one Wong Xue Yu to amend the statements he had earlier given to the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”), so as to falsely conceal from the CAD your and Quah Su-Ling’s involvement in the trades in securities of Blumont Group Ltd, Asiasons Capital Limited and LionGold Corp Ltd conducted through trading accounts opened with AmFraser Securities Pte Ltd (now known as KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.1276 I begin with Mr Wong XY’s evidence.

 Mr Wong XY explained that he took this position because he was afraid of reprisal from the First Accused, and, further, he was also trying to avoid jeopardising his chances of recovering monies from the accused persons. However, when confronted with an email he had sent the First Accused setting out the trading limits of the Relevant Accounts, Mr Wong XY found himself unable to explain the contents of the email. Thus, he came clean to the CAD in his second statement to the CAD on the same day, 3 April 2014.

At their meeting, she informed him that there were rumours that he had “ratted on” the accused persons to the CAD. Mr Wong XY was very concerned about this, as he was concerned that he would not be able to repay the losses without the help of the accused persons. He subsequently arranged a meeting with the First Accused through Ms Ooi, sometime between 10 April 2014 and 24 April 2014.

 and did in fact amend his earlier answers such that they were less incriminating of the accused persons. In my view, the amendments made by Mr Wong XY to his earlier statements were not insignificant. Though they did not absolve the accused persons entirely, the amendments plainly sought to minimise the character and extent of the accused persons’ involvement in the use of the accounts.

 It was likely that Mr Wong XY simply could not absolve them completely given: (a) the objective evidence he had been confronted with; and (b) how strange it would have appeared for him to revert to his original position after stating that he had originally lied. Indeed, Mr Wong XY himself gave evidence that he had found it difficult to say that the accused persons had not given any trading instructions at all after previously saying that they had done so for all the accounts. Mr Wong XY also stated that he found it difficult to say that some of the BAL trades executed in accounts belonging to his friends were their trades, given the size of the trades, which exceeded their financial means.

1281 In response to the evidence given against him by Mr Wong XY, the First Accused denied meeting Mr Wong in April 2014. He agreed that he had met Mr Wong XY, but that their meeting was around the time of Mr Wong XY’s birthday in August 2014. However, as this meeting took place after Mr Wong’s statements had already been amended in April 2014, it would not have been possible for the First Accused to cause Mr Wong XY to amend his earlier statements to conceal the accused persons’ involvement.

 If that had been true, there was no reason for the First Accused to agree to meet Mr Wong XY for his birthday in order to pass him a red packet. It was not wholly clear why the First Accused would have known Mr Wong XY’s birthdate at all. In this connection, the Prosecution submitted

 1283 Such an explanation was certainly possible, though I found it somewhat speculative and ultimately unnecessary. This brings me to my first point that the First Accused’s explanation was a distraction. Irrespective of whether a meeting actually took place in August 2014, the simple point was that the First Accused had denied the meeting in April 2014 and this denial had to be pitted against Mr Wong XY’s evidence to the contrary. 1284 In support of his position, the First Accused submitted that Mr Wong XY’s account was not credible. Chiefly, this submission was premised on two aspects of Mr Wong XY’s evidence. First, Mr Wong XY claimed that he had complied with the First Accused’s supposed instructions to conceal the accused persons’ involvement from the CAD. However, the amendments Mr Wong XY made to his statements did not do anything to make his account less incriminating of the accused persons. To this end, the First Accused characterised the amendments as “in for a penny, in for a pound”.

 Second, Mr Wong XY had changed his answers to incriminate the accused persons in his second statement on 3 April 2014 because he had been caught lying. Therefore, the more reasonable explanation for his later amendments was also that he had been caught lying to the investigators.

1285 I did not accept this submission. By the amendments made, Mr Wong XY patently downplayed the role of the accused persons. Further, the character of the amendments made by Mr Wong XY was of no benefit to himself. They solely benefitted the accused persons, who were earlier stated to have given all of the trading instructions in respect of the Relevant Accounts under Mr Wong XY’s management. In his revised answers Mr Wong XY stated that they had only given some of the trading instructions.

  WXY-1, Question 113.



 There was no sensible reason for Mr Wong XY to initiate these amendments, which did nothing but invite greater scrutiny as regards his own credibility, if not for some external force directing him to do so.1286 I accepted that the First Accused was that external force. I therefore found that the First Accused had intentionally tampered with Mr Wong XY’s evidence. He did so by asking Mr Wong XY to amend his earlier statements to the CAD in order to conceal the accused persons’ involvement in the BAL trades carried out in the Relevant Accounts held with AmFraser under the management of Mr Wong XY. The First Accused did so with the intent to pervert the course of justice by frustrating the ongoing investigations against the accused persons. Thus, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Charge 189 was made out and I convicted him accordingly. And, again, for completeness, I reiterate my rejection of the First Accused’s argument set out at [1200] above. My reasons for this have been set out at [1225] above.Summary: The Witness Tampering Charges 1287 In summary, I found the First Accused guilty of each of the eight Witness Tampering Charges which had been brought against him. In my judgment, the manner in which the First Accused went about these acts in violation or attempted violation of s 204A of the Penal Code was methodical in the sense that he knew to address the evidence of crucial witnesses, and to do so from the early stages of the investigation. 1288 Of course, tampering with the evidence of important witnesses is significant in any case. Its impact was magnified by the complexity of the case. When the investigators were seeking to uncover the truth in this case, extensive work would have been needed just to unpack matters suspected to be untruths or part-truths. Further interviews would have been necessary, documents would have required re-examination, and, finally, the investigators would have needed to review a vast sea of information to identify consistencies and inconsistencies. The more significant a witness to the overall puzzle yet to be solved, the more challenging it would have been for the investigators to unpack their potential untruths or part-truths. In this regard, the First Accused certainly knew how to set the investigators on the most difficult path to the truth. Or, in his own words to Mr Gan, if the tampered witnesses had followed his instructions strictly, the authorities would not have been able to “crack it” (see [1238] above).Summary of my decision on criminal liability1289 I summarise my decision for the five groups of charges separately.1290 In respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges:(a) First, I found that 187 of the 189 Relevant Accounts had been controlled by the accused persons. The two accounts which I did not find to have been controlled were held personally in the name of Ms Cheng. The volume of BAL trades carried out in these accounts did not materially affect the Prosecution’s case.(b) Second, I found that the evidence also established that the accused persons had coordinated their use of the 187 Relevant Accounts under their control. The consistency and extent of their coordination pointed clearly towards the existence of some general scheme in respect of which the accounts were likely being used.(c) Third, I accepted the evidence of Professor Aitken and found that illegitimate trading practices had been used by the Relevant Accounts to inflate the markets for and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period. Coupled with my findings on control, the use of such practices further pointed to the existence of some scheme or schemes.(d) Fourth, I found that the markets for BAL shares had in fact been inflated by the trading activity performed in the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts. Such inflation was substantial and, on the basis that these accounts had been centrally controlled, this pointed to an intention on the part of the controllers to manipulate the market for BAL shares. (e) Fifth, I found that the prices of BAL shares had also been inflated as a result of trading activity executed by certain Relevant Accounts during the specific periods of the Price Manipulation Charges. I generally accepted Mr Ellison’s evidence though I did not regard it as having much utility in specifically establishing the Price Manipulation Charges.(f) Sixth, I found the accused persons had a broader plan. Such plan was to bring together (i) the First Accused’s involvement in the management of BAL, and (ii) the artificially inflated prices and liquidity of BAL’s shares, in order to use such shares as currency for corporate acquisitions to be made by BAL.(g) Finally, I found that the accused persons’ conduct following the Crash was revealing of their Scheme. In particular, the First Accused’s tampering with witnesses evidenced a contemporaneous concern on his part to conceal matters from discovery. The existence of such a concern supported the view that there was a scheme to be found.1291 Drawing these findings together, and addressing my mind to the specific terms of each of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, I found that each of those ten charges had been made out against the accused persons. Specifically, I found that the charges had not only been made out in the sense that the accused persons had conspired to commit offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, but, further, that they had successfully managed to carry out the various conspiracies. Accordingly, I determined that the substantive offences under s 197(1)(b) had been completed as well.1292 In respect of the Deception Charges:(a) I took the view that the Deception Charges drafted by the Prosecution were somewhat broad and they were not strictly supported by the definition of “unauthorised share trading” laid down in Ng Geok Eng. Nonetheless, I held that – in the circumstances of the present case – the charges disclosed an offence under the broad terms of s 201(b) of the SFA.(b) I held that the Prosecution needed to prove each and every specific conspiracy alleged by the 161 Deception Charges. It was not permissible for the Prosecution to simply prove the overarching Scheme and assert that, following from that, the accused persons could be assumed to have entered into numerous sub-conspiracies.(c) On these premises, I went on to analyse the 161 charges which remained in issue before the end of the trial. I found 153 had been made out. Indeed, apart from the fact of the accused persons’ conspiracies to commit offences under s 201(b) of the SFA, I found the substantive s 201(b) offences had been completed as well. (d) I acquitted the accused persons of eight charges. Of these, two charges related to Ms Cheng’s personal accounts with CIMB and Credit Suisse which I found had not been controlled by the accused persons. It followed that if the accused persons had not even controlled these accounts, the Deception Charges could not be made out. (e) As regards the remaining six Deception Charges of which the accused persons had been acquitted, there was not enough evidence to show that the Second Accused knew of the existence of these accounts. While such knowledge was not necessary for the overarching Scheme and the broader conspiracies to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL shares, it undermined the specific conspiracies alleged by the Deception Charges. 1293 In respect of the Cheating Charges:(a) I reiterated my salient findings that the accused persons had exercised control over the six accounts forming the subject of the Cheating Charges; that they had been involved in the provision and management of collateral placed in the accounts; and that I found them guilty of the False Trading Charges.(b) I found that a deception may be practised on a victim of cheating through a third party, by omission. This could be made out even when that third party was not aware of the vital information which, if disclosed, would negate the deception. (c) I did not accept the Defence’s contention that the FIs had not been deceived or induced to provide financing because they had carried out their own reviews on the quantum of financing to be provided on collateral. If the FIs had known that the markets for BAL shares had been manipulated, this information would have obviated the need for any review on their own part. (d) On these premises, I found that the accused persons had conspired to cheat both Goldman Sachs and IB; that a deception had been practised on the FIs; that the FIs had been deceived; that the FIs had been induced by that deception to provide financing; and that the accused persons had acted with dishonest intent. Accordingly, I convicted them of all six Cheating Charges and, since financing had been provided by the FIs, I found that the substantive offences under s 420 of the Penal Code had been completed as well.1294 In respect of the Company Management Charges:(a) I held that s 148(1) of the Companies Act ought to catch persons who are given some measure of responsibility or area of discretion, or whose opinion is given some weight in the decision-making processes, on matters which affect the company and the conduct of its affairs. A person does not have to be at the highest echelons of a company to be concerned in its management.(b) On this footing, I undertook a thorough analysis of the evidence available in respect of each of the three companies – Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold – and found that there was ample evidence to show that the First Accused had been concerned in their management. His involvement in LionGold was the most extensive, but it was also at a very high level vis-à-vis Blumont. While his involvement in the management of Asiasons was not as extensive, there was certainly enough to show that the threshold for s 148(1) had been crossed.1295 In respect of the Witness Tampering Charges, I undertook a thorough analysis of the facts and evidence available, and I found that each of the eight charges had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.My decision on sentence1296 In the 1295 foregoing paragraphs, I have addressed the accused persons’ criminal liability for the many charges they faced. I convicted the First Accused of 180 out of the total 189 charges which had been brought against him, and I convicted the Second Accused of 169 out of the total 178 charges brought against her. I acquitted both of Charge 153 (a Deception Charge) at the close of the Prosecution’s case upon the Defence’s submission that there was no case to answer. At the end of the trial, I acquitted both accused persons of a further eight charges – Charges 96, 121, 122, 157, 158, 160 to 162 – all of which were also Deception Charges.1297 I now turn to the matter of sentencing, and my reasons for imposing on the accused persons imprisonment terms of 36 and 20 years respectively (see [7] above). In this section, my grounds will proceed as follows.(a) First, I will address two broad issues that were heavily contested throughout the trial and which bore on the issue of sentencing. These were: (i) whether the accused persons could be said to have been the cause of the Crash; and (ii) what was the volume of BAL trades executed in the Relevant Accounts which could actually be attributed to the accused persons.(b) Second, I will address two general sentencing arguments raised by the Defence. These arguments went towards the following two questions: (i) whether the accused persons ought to be sentenced under s 109 or s 116 of the Penal Code; and (ii) whether there was substantial prosecutorial delay such that the Second Accused ought to be given a significant sentencing discount.(c) Third, I will turn to the sentences I imposed for each group of charges. In this connection, I will set out the aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution, the Defence’s response to those factors, and the factors which I ultimately took into consideration. In respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, the Deception Charges, and the Cheating Charges, it was also necessary to address the relative culpability of the accused persons.(d) Finally, I will turn to the sentences I determined ought to run consecutively, the resultant aggregate sentences, as well as any adjustments to be made on account of the totality principle.Two salient issues relevant to sentencing1298 At trial, two issues were heavily disputed. First, whether the accused persons could be said to have been responsible for the Crash. Second, what was the volume of BAL trades executed in the Relevant Accounts during the Relevant Period that could be attributed to the accused persons. Although the grounds of my decision above show that these two issues did not need to be resolved in order to determine the accused persons’ criminal liability, particularly the False Trading or Price Manipulation Charges, the answers to these two questions were potentially relevant to the sentencing of those charges. Thus, when I delivered my judgment on liability on 5 May 2022, I made findings on these issues so that parties could take into consideration my findings when advancing their submissions on sentencing.The accused persons’ responsibility for the Crash1299 I have described the events leading to the Crash, as well as the Crash itself at [12]–[18] above. I also mentioned that the Prosecution’s case, in essence, was that the accused persons were the cause of the Crash because they had, by their Scheme, created appearances as to the markets and prices of BAL shares which were “so utterly false that when the music eventually stopped and the bubble burst on 4 October 2013, the share prices of all three companies collapsed”.

1300 The Defence refuted this rigorously, and argued instead that the Crash had been caused by other factors including the following.(a) One, there was evidence that UOB was the first to designate BAL shares, and this action would have applied downward pressure on the prices of the shares.

 and, thus, could not give any meaningful evidence as to the key events during the Relevant Period.1302 Admittedly, I was also disappointed with the manner in which this issue was handled by the Prosecution and the SGX.

 It should have been clear that Mr Kelvin Koh, who not only issued the query, but who also held a senior office in the SGX during the Relevant Period, was probably the best person to give evidence for and on behalf of the SGX, apart perhaps from Mdm Yeo (see [18] above). This would not only have given the Defence an opportunity to address what seemed to be a crucial aspect of their case, it would also have served the purpose of completing the picture for a case which was patently one of general public interest. While Mr Lek was helpful to the extent that he could explain how the SGX exhibits were prepared, he simply was not in a position to speak about matters in which he was not involved. Indeed, during the Relevant Period, Mr Lek had not even joined the SGX. In that sense, he served primarily as a formal witness through whom exhibits had to be adduced. In my view, such a formalistic approach should have been avoided, and it was unfortunate that it was not.1303 However, I still did not agree with the Defence that the accused persons could not be said to be the cause of the Crash. To be clear, I accepted that they were not the sole cause of the Crash. This, however, in my view, missed the point. It was unnecessary for this court to determine with such precision, the exact cause of the Crash. The purpose of determining, as a matter of fact, what had caused the Crash which wiped out around S$7.8 billion in market capitalisation from the SGX, was simply to ascertain whether the accused persons could be held responsible for this substantial harm. This, in turn, could have borne on the sentence which ought to be imposed on them.1304 With this in mind, even if I had accepted all five points raised by the First Accused as set out at [1300] above, that would not have absolved the accused persons of responsibility for the Crash and, more importantly, its consequent harm. I had three main reasons for this view.(a) First, a consequence of my decision on the four Price Manipulation Charges was that the accused persons were, as a matter of fact, responsible for hiking the prices of Asiasons and LionGold shares in August and September 2013, and falsely supporting the prices of Blumont and Asiasons shares right before the Crash.(b) Second, UOB, the SGX, the SIAS and Goldman Sachs’ responses to this hike were, by no means, illegal. Neither were their responses unreasonable. Indeed, having created false appearances as to both the liquidity and prices of BAL shares, it was difficult for the accused persons to maintain that UOB, the SGX, the SIAS and Goldman Sachs acted unreasonably. In fact, they were, with hindsight, right in assessing that something was amiss with the prices of BAL shares. Their acts were not so unconnected to the accused persons’ actions so as to sever the connection between the artificial price hikes created by the accused persons and the Crash.(c) Third, and most importantly, given, as I had found, that the prices of BAL shares were artificially inflated by the accused persons, there appeared to be only two feasible ways by which the sudden and damaging Crash could have been avoided. One, if the Scheme had not been discovered, and the accused persons had been allowed to continue carrying out their illegal scheme until it petered out softly in some way, at some later point in time. Two, in the same circumstances, if BAL eventually came to grow into companies of such value to match the prices at which their shares were being traded. Patently, neither can excuse the accused persons’ responsibility for the harm caused by the Crash since both these solutions require that they be permitted to continue perpetuating their illegal scheme.1305 For these reasons, I found that the accused persons were responsible for the Crash on 4 October 2013. After all, when one intentionally creates false appearances in the securities market, there is always a risk, once the veil is lifted and questions start getting asked, that those false appearances may fall away. If one is fortunate, they may fall away quietly and without impact. However, when they fall away in an eventful manner, and the Crash was eventful, to say the least, it hardly lies in the mouths of the persons who initiated those false appearances to argue that others should not have pulled the veil away in the first place. Having intentionally created an unnatural state of affairs in the securities market, the accused persons’ conduct could not be regarded with leniency because others responded in ways which were, as stated, neither illegal nor unreasonable. With hindsight, those other actors may have chosen different courses of action, or, they may not have. Whether they should have chosen differently was not for me to say. The point was that, even if they would have chosen differently with hindsight, that would not have absolved the accused persons of responsibility for the Crash.1306 I should state that, as this was a matter which went towards sentencing, I preferred the language of “responsibility” as used above. Nevertheless, as the Defence had couched its arguments in the language of “causation”, I was also prepared to find that the accused persons’ creation of the substantially false markets and prices of BAL shares, by carrying out their Scheme, was a causa sine qua non of the Crash. Further, I was not satisfied that the actions of UOB, the SGX, the SIAS and Goldman Sachs amounted to intervening acts which broke the causal link between the two. That said, I should emphasise that the relevance and weight (if any) to be given to this conclusion for the purpose of sentencing is a matter I will return to shortly.Volume of BAL trades attributable to the accused persons1307 Another matter which potentially bore on the sentences to be imposed on the accused persons in respect of the False Trading Charges was the extent to which the volume of BAL trades executed in each of the Relevant Accounts under their control (187 of the total 189) could be attributed to them.1308 In so far as criminal liability for the charges was concerned, the Prosecution’s case was simply that the accused persons had control over the Relevant Accounts and could use the accounts in furtherance of their Scheme. Prior to this issue being addressed in the parties’ sentencing submissions, the Prosecution had not taken up the question of whether each and every BAL trade executed in the Relevant Accounts during the Relevant Period could be attributed to the accused persons, or, whether only some percentage of those trades to be determined could be so attributed.1309 Ultimately, I found that most of the BAL trades carried out in the Relevant Accounts during the Relevant Period were to be attributed to the accused persons for the purpose of sentencing. This was a qualitative, not a quantitative conclusion. To more fully appreciate how I arrived at this view, however, it is necessary to start with the findings and observations I made on 5 May 2022 in my oral judgment on the accused persons’ criminal liability:

  Oral Judgment on Liability at [526]–[533].



526 As far as I have found, the accused persons were in control [of 187 Relevant Accounts]. However, this understanding of control does not require the idea of exclusive control. Indeed, it does not appear to me to be the Prosecution’s case that the accused persons exercised exclusive control over each and every one of the Relevant Accounts. It may well be that the accounts were exclusively controlled as a matter of fact, but I do not understand it to be their case that even if the accountholders wished to place an order for shares, that the accused persons were able to preclude them from doing so, ie, that the accountholders had no control over the[ir] [own] accounts. That said, for most of the accounts, the legal distinction is simply irrelevant as a matter of fact. Numerous TRs gave evidence that they only received trading instructions from the accused persons and not the accountholders. Some accountholders have also testified that only the accused persons used the accounts. In respect of these accounts, although the distinction between exclusive control and control still exists, it is simply irrelevant based on the evidence placed before me, and the facts I found thereon. 527 That said, based on the First Accused’s submissions, in respect of Mr Tai, this distinction is relevant in a slightly different way. In seeking to demonstrate that Mr Tai was not under the accused persons’ control, the First Accused submits that he was, in essence, conducting illegal and illegitimate trading activities on his own part. I reserved the discussion of these points for the full grounds of my decision. However, for the purposes of disposing of this ancillary point which goes towards sentencing, I will state the first accused’s arguments briefly. These activities which the First Accused submits Mr Tai was carrying out, include the following:(a) First, “unauthorised trades” which involved Mr Tai trading back and forth between the Saxo and IB accounts under his management, thus “churning” commissions for himself.(b) Second, “ping pong trades” which involved Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa using the accounts under their management to trade back and forth, so as to generate commissions for themselves.(c) Third, “scam trades”. This involved Mr Tai rolling over shares when there was no need to do so (ie, even when the full T+5 was reached, neither Saxo nor IB required the shares to be rolled over), thus generating commissions for himself. On Mr Tai’s evidence, I find that the period he can be said to have been doing this was from January to October 2012. As such, only the volumes in August to October 2012 are relevant insofar as the False Trading Charges are concerned.528 If these allegations are borne out, the First Accused’s underlying point is that Mr Tai’s (as well as Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa’s) trading activity ought not to be attributed to him and the accused persons. This point seeks to meet the Prosecution’s case at two levels. First, it attempts to undermine the very allegation that the accused persons were controlling the many accounts under Mr Tai, Mr Gan and Mr Tjoa’s management (totalling 61). As discussed above, I have rejected this, and found the accused persons to be in control of these accounts.529 Second, even if it cannot obviate a finding of control entirely, it can show that the accused persons did not have exclusive control over these accounts, and where another person, eg, Mr Tai, also conducted trades in these accounts, the accused persons should not be liable for those persons’ illegal and illegitimate trading activities. It is meaningful to recall [my statement above that] there is no specific volume of trades which determines that an offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA is made out. The accused persons can be saddled with some of the trades conducted in this account and still – as I have found – be guilty of the False Trading Charges. This does not, however, mean that they should be saddled with all the trades if others are responsible for some of them.530 I have considered the submissions of the parties, the evidence of Mr Tai, Mr Gan, Mr Tjoa, Mr Gwee, and of course the First Accused. Having done so, I find that none of these allegations should reduce the volume of trades which should be attributed to the accused persons. First, I will explain in the full grounds of my decision that I do not find that Mr Tai conducted any “unauthorised trading”. As such, there is no factual basis for such a reduction. Second, … I do not accept that there were “ping pong trades” coordinated between Mr Tai and Mr Tjoa so as to generate commissions for themselves. Lastly, I accept Mr Tai’s admission that he had effectively “scammed” the accused persons by pocketing commissions from active trading which did not need to be conducted. He certainly did benefit. That said, I have considered the evidence on which both sides have relied carefully, and my conclusion is that these were not trades which Mr Tai carried out without their instructions on his own. Certainly, he concealed from the accused persons the fact that there was no need for trades to be rolled over, leaving them with the erroneous impression that they needed to be. However, at the T+5 mark, when those trades were rolled over, I do not find that Mr Tai was acting on his own accord. The accused persons were still instructing him to do so. Indeed, this was substantially prior to the first time Mr Tai was appointed by the accused persons to coordinate the market rolling activities for LionGold shares in April 2013.531 I therefore find that the “scam trades” conducted by Mr Tai should not be discounted from the total volume of trades conducted in the Relevant Accounts attributable to the accused persons. In the abstract, I understand the exception to which the accused persons take to Mr Tai’s conduct. However, even putting aside the irony of their unhappiness about being cheated whilst they themselves were manipulating the market, the fact of Mr Tai’s cheating does not do away with their instructions directing him to place those orders and trades in furtherance of the Scheme. I will, as with many other points in this oral judgment, deal with this issue in more detail in the full grounds of my decision.532 As I understand it, based on the accused persons’ control, use and management of the accounts to trade BAL shares to perpetrate their Scheme, the Prosecution’s position seems to be that all the BAL trades (and the total volume of the BAL trades) within them should be attributed to the accused persons. In light of my observations that exclusive control is not required for the purposes of liability, I do not accept the Prosecution’s submission. For the purpose of sentencing, the Prosecution may further submit on this issue if it wishes. In particular, if the Prosecution wishes for me to take the specific volume of BAL trades into account, they need to prove – beyond reasonable doubt – that the volume they put forth is attributable to the accused persons. This may be done in several different ways. For example, as stated, where a TR has given evidence that no one other than the accused persons gave trading instructions in respect of a particular account, that is a meaningful starting point to assess whether each and every BAL trade executed in that relevant account was in fact instructed by the accused persons. If, however, the Defence disputes particular trades, the Prosecution’s evidence may need to be more particular, depending on the nature of the Defence’s refutation. It bears emphasising, however, that this is a matter for the parties to determine. If the Prosecution does not wish for me to rely on the specific volume of trades executed in the 187 controlled [Relevant Accounts] as part of the accused persons’ scheme, they need not do so. My point is simply that, if they wish to, it is not enough to rely on the findings I make in respect of liability which is premised on the notion of non-exclusive control.533 As a final note, I should state clearly that the trading volumes in Ms Cheng’s two personal accounts with CIMB and Credit Suisse, as I have set out above, ought not to be attributed to the accused persons. This is the consequence of my determination that these accounts were not controlled by them.[emphasis in original; cross-references omitted]1310 Given my findings on Mr Tai’s allegedly “unauthorised trades”, “ping pong trades” and “scam trades” (see [694]–[703] above), these matters did not remain directly in issue when the parties returned before me in November 2022 to make their submissions on sentence. The issue in dispute at that stage was, more generally, the extent to which the accused persons ought to be held responsible for the volume of BAL trades executed in the 187 Relevant Accounts I found to have been under the accused persons’ control. 1311 The parties’ positions at the sentencing stage were as follows:(a) The Prosecution submitted that the accused persons should be held responsible for “substantially all, if not all” of the BAL trades executed in those 187 accounts. By this, they seemed to have opted not to attribute a specific volume of trades to the accused persons. Indeed, the evidence on which the Prosecution relied was also of a qualitative, and not a quantitative nature.

1312 The genesis of the parties’ dispute was, evidently, paragraph 532 of my oral judgment reproduced at [1309] above. Indeed, the opposing positions they took seemed to be a consequence of different views they took of what I meant by paragraph 532, neither of which was wholly correct. My difficulties with the respective positions they took were as follows.1313 I begin with the Prosecution’s position. By paragraph 532 of my oral judgment, I had essentially given the Prosecution two options in so far as attributing BAL trade volumes to the accused persons was concerned. If the Prosecution wished to pursue a quantitative conclusion, I stated that quantitative conclusions required quantitative proof. If, however, the Prosecution did not wish to go down that path, I also stated that they were free to pursue a qualitative conclusion and, if they did so, such a conclusion would only require qualitative proof. The difficulty with the Prosecution’s sentencing position was that, while they relied primarily on qualitative proof, they urged me to make the finding that “substantially all, if not all” [emphasis added] of the BAL trades carried out in the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts were attributable to the accused persons. The phrase “if not all” imported the suggestion of a quantitative conclusion that the accused persons were responsible for 100% of the BAL trades carried out in those accounts. It was thus slightly incongruent for those words to be included.1314 On the Defence’s end, however, as can clearly be seen from the passages reproduced above, paragraph 532 of my oral judgment was not an open invitation for the Defence to reopen matters which I had already determined for the purposes of the accused persons’ criminal liability. The thrust of the Defence’s submissions – ostensibly on sentence – was that the 62 Relevant Accounts under the management of Mr Tai, Mr Tjoa, Mr Gan and Mr Leroy Lau were not in fact controlled Relevant Accounts. This was not an issue left open by paragraph 532 of my oral judgment and I accordingly rejected the accused persons’ contention that they should not be held liable for the BAL trades that had been executed in those accounts. If the accused persons had wished to press the submission that there ought to be a reduction in the volume of BAL trades attributable to them from those accounts, they should have put forward material to show that specific trades had been carried out by Mr Leroy Lau, Mr Tai, Mr Tjoa or Mr Gan outside the terms of the Scheme. However, this was not their approach. There was thus little I could make of their broad submission that they should not be held responsible for the BAL trades that had been executed in those Relevant Accounts.1315 Having rejected the Defence’s contention on this issue, the point which remained was what volume of BAL trades executed in the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts ought then to be attributed to the accused persons. Upon my revisitation of the evidence, I was satisfied – beyond reasonable doubt – that the accused persons were responsible for most of the BAL trades executed in those accounts.1316 Before I leave this issue, I should add that the volume of BAL trades attributable to the accused persons was not in itself an aggravating factor that affected the potential sentence to be imposed on the accused persons. The aggravating factor, as I will explain from [1366] below, was the sheer scale of the Scheme. This finding instead resolved the extent to which the accused persons could be held responsible for such scale.Two general arguments raised by the Defence1317 In the Defence’s submissions on sentence, two general arguments were raised by counsel for the accused persons. (a) The first was raised by both Mr Sreenivasan for the First Accused as well as Mr Suang Wijaya (“Mr Wijaya”) for the Second Accused. The argument relates to the Conspiracy Charges and, in essence, it was contended that both accused persons ought to be sentenced by reference to s 116 of the Penal Code instead of s 109 of the same Act.(b) The second argument was only raised by Mr Wijaya for the Second Accused. Essentially, it was claimed that there had been substantial prosecutorial delay in these proceedings such that the Second Accused should be given a significant sentencing discount.1318 I did not accept either argument.Sentencing provision applicable to the Conspiracy Charges1319 The first argument, put simply, concerned two sub-issues. One, whether s 109 of the Penal Code was even a provision applicable to sentencing offenders convicted of criminal conspiracy as opposed to abetment by any means, including abetment by conspiracy. Two, if s 109 was potentially applicable to the offence of criminal conspiracy, whether the accused persons in this case ought to be sentenced for the Conspiracy Charges on that footing. That is, that the substantive offences underlying the False Trading, Price Manipulation, Deception, and Cheating Charges had been committed. If so, they were liable under s 109 of the Penal Code to face the full punishment provided for those offences. In the case of the False Trading, Price Manipulation and Deception Charges, that was a fine not exceeding S$250,000, a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, or both. In respect of the Cheating Charges, the punishment was an imprisonment term which could extend to ten years and a fine. If, however, the accused persons were to be sentenced on the basis that the underlying offences had not been committed, they would have been liable under s 116 of the Penal Code only to one-fourth of those sentences.1320 For ease, the applicable versions of these provisions, in force during the Relevant Period, read:Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence, and where no express provision is made for its punishment109. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.Abetment of an offence punishable with imprisonment116. Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both; and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both.[illustrations omitted]For the avoidance of any uncertainty, it bears stating that though s 109 of the current version of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed) remains unchanged, s 116 was amended by s 35 of the CLRA 2019.1321 In so far as criminal conspiracy is concerned – as opposed to abetment by conspiracy – the two provisions, in turn, need to be read with s 120B of the Penal Code:Punishment of criminal conspiracy120B. Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence.[emphasis added in italics]1322 Several points were advanced by the Defence in support of the view that the accused persons should be sentenced by reference to s 116 of the Penal Code and not s 109.

 These points may be summarised as two full arguments.1323 First, that the court was not entitled – for the purposes of sentencing – to take into consideration that the substantive offences underlying the Conspiracy Charges, had been made out. This was because the accused persons had not been charged with or convicted of those substantive offences; they also had not been charged with or convicted of abetting the commission of those substantive offences; nor was it even expressly alleged in the Conspiracy Charges that the accused persons had completed the substantive offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, s 201(b) of the SFA, or s 420 of the Penal Code. In respect of this argument, I should highlight a minor difference between the positions of the First and Second Accused.1324 Counsel for the First Accused, Mr Sreenivasan, seemed to accept that, had the Prosecution expressly averred in the Conspiracy Charges that the underlying offences forming the subject of those conspiracies had been committed, s 109 of the Penal Code could apply. However, he argued that, when the Prosecution applied in August 2019 to amend the previously preferred charges for abetment by conspiracy to the Conspiracy Charges ultimately proceeded on, they did not include such an allegation.

 While reference was made to s 109 of the Penal Code as the applicable sentencing provision, this, Mr Sreenivasan submitted, “[did] not put the issue to rest” because the mere reference to s 109 “[did] not include or preclude the operation of … [s 116]”.

 [B]y choosing not to include an averment in the charges that the offences that were the subject matter of the conspiracy took place, the question of whether there were any substantive offences other than the criminal conspiracy was NOT the subject matter of any charge. The question now is whether [the commission of those offences may nevertheless] be the basis for sentencing.According to the Prosecution, the [a]ccused [p]ersons should be punished under s 109 of the Penal Code, ie, “as if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment”. The Prosecution had previously amended the charges from charges of abetment by conspiracy under s 109, to the present charges. Having departed from their earlier position, they can no longer return to s 109, except for the purposes of sentencing:(a) Originally, the accused persons were charged for abetment by conspiracy, which would mean that the Prosecution would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused persons had committed the underlying offences;(b) By amending the charges to charges of criminal conspiracy, the Prosecution was relieved of the burden of proving that the accused persons had committed the underlying offences (as it would be sufficient to prove that the accused persons had merely conspired to do so). Despite this, the Prosecution insists that the Accused Persons can still be sentenced in the same manner as if they had never amended the charges;(c) The Prosecution was entitled to choose which charges it wanted to bring against the accused persons. However, they cannot avoid the burden of proof by amending the charges and yet seek a sentence as if they had never amended the charges. The Prosecution cannot have their cake and eat it; and(d) The Prosecution might have been able to take their present tack if the amended charges had included an averment that the object of the conspiracy was in fact carried out and offences were committed. If they prove that ingredient then punishment would be the full s 109 punishment, and if they could not prove it, then punishment would be s 109 punishment, as qualified by the former s 116.What the Prosecution cannot do is to omit from the charges the very ingredient that it seeks to rely upon in sentencing. In short, the Defence submits that as a consequence of the Prosecution’s amendment of the charges, the [a]ccused [p]ersons should be sentenced under the former s 116 of the Penal Code instead, such that the maximum sentence for each offence is reduced to one-fourth of the term provided for.[emphasis added]1325 The position taken by counsel for the Second Accused, Mr Wijaya, was slightly different. Unlike Mr Sreenivasan, Mr Wijaya did not seem to accept that it was permissible for the accused persons to be sentenced under s 109 of the Penal Code for the Conspiracy Charges, even if the Prosecution had expressly alleged therein that the underlying offences had been completed. In this connection, Mr Wijaya placed great emphasis on the fact that the accused persons had not been convicted of abetting the commission of the substantive offences, which would have engaged s 109 of the Penal Code.1326 Although s 120B of the Penal Code provided that where a person is convicted of an offence under s 120A, he is to be punished “in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence”, Mr Wijaya argued that this did not have the effect of deeming that person – a s 120A conspirator – an “abettor” within the meaning of ss 107 and 108.

1327 That s 120B of the Penal Code does not have such a deeming effect was said to be significant because the text of s 109 made clear that it only operated as the provision for punishing the offence of abetment as defined by s 107, whether by conspiracy or otherwise, and not criminal conspiracy under s 120A.

 By contrast, ss 119 and 120 used the phrases “design to commit such an offence” rather than “abetment”, indicating that they were punishment provisions applicable to the offence of criminal conspiracy.

 Therefore, as s 109 was only applicable for punishing the offence of abetment, it could not be applied to punish the accused persons as they were only convicted for the offence of criminal conspiracy.1328 This, of course, left the question of what sentencing provision was then applicable to persons convicted of criminal conspiracy as opposed to abetment, whether by conspiracy or other means. On this, Mr Wijaya submitted:

There is no injustice in our analysis …:First, the legislature could have used words in ss 109 and 120B that would achieve the outcome the Prosecution desires. As we have explained, the word “design” could be used in addition or substitution to “abetment’ in s 109 (as was done in ss 119 or 120). Or, s 120B could have contained deeming provisions similar to s 31 of the [Prevention of Corruption Act] or s 12 of the [Misuse of Drugs Act]. No such legislative expressions were used.Second, if it were thought that there are lacunae in the legislation, the Court of Appeal has emphasised in Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others [2018] 1 SLR 659 at [1] that “the court’s power to do justice does not include legislative power; in other words, the court cannot impermissibly add to or take away from statutory language because its law-making power does not extend to the statutory domain”.Third, this outcome is the result of the Prosecution’s own election to amend the charges to those under s 120A, thereby taking the benefit of a lower burden of proof and reduced need for particularisation.We note that s 116 of the Penal Code provides for a situation where an offence is abetted, but then the offence abetted was not committed “in consequence of the abetment”. Section 116 of the Penal Code may be applicable where, for instance, the offender abetted an offence by instigating another person to commit the offence, but the other person did not eventually commit the offence. The version of s 116 that was in force at the material time of the alleged offences for which [the Second Accused] has been convicted provides that in such a situation, the offender would be subject to a maximum imprisonment term of [one-fourth] of the maximum imprisonment term for the offence abetted.It is [the Second Accused’s] respectful submission that, just as s 116 of the Penal Code contemplates [a one-fourth] punishment on the basis that the offender abetted the underlying offence but the underlying offence was not ultimately committed at all or in consequence of the abetment, then it only follows that under s 120A of the Penal Code where there is similarly no deemed or even presumed commission of the underlying offence, the sentence meted must also be substantially reduced like in s 116 of the Penal Code.1329 In summary, Mr Wijaya’s point seemed to be that – both on a textual and purposive reading of the relevant provisions – s 109 of the Penal Code could not be applied to sentence offenders convicted of criminal conspiracy. If the Prosecution had wished to pursue the full sentences imposable for the substantive offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, s 201(b) of the SFA, and s 420 of the Penal Code, it was incumbent on them to have charged the accused persons either for abetting the commission of those substantive underlying offences, or for the commission of those offences in addition to the Conspiracy Charges.

… Conspiracy to commit an offence is itself an offence and a person can be separately charged with respect to such a conspiracy. There is no analogy between Section 120-B and Section 109 [of the Indian Penal Code (“IPC”)]. There may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy; but conspiracy is something more than an abetment. Offences created by Sections 109 an 120B IPC are quite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of conspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was something over and above that. Where a number of offences are committed by several persons in pursuance of a conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those offences as well as with the offence of conspiracy to commit those offences. As an instance of this we may refer to the case of S Swaminatham v State of Madras AIR 1957 SC 343. Though the point was not argued before this Court in the way it appears to have been argued before the Madras High Court and before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, this Court did not see anything wrong in the trial of several persons accused of offences under Section 120-B and Section 420 IPC. We cannot, therefore accept the view taken by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh that the charge of conspiracy was bad. If the alleged offences are said to have flown out of the conspiracy the appropriate form of charge would be a specific charge in respect of each of those offences along with the charge of conspiracy.[emphasis added]1331 I did not accept either Mr Sreenivasan or Mr Wijaya’s arguments. They appeared to me to introduce several unnecessary layers of legal complication, convolution and confusion where none existed. In my judgment, the question of what the applicable sentencing provision was, could be understood in three relatively straightforward steps.1332 First, by enacting s 120B of the Penal Code in the terms it did, it was clear that Parliament intended that parties to a criminal conspiracy be punished “as if” they were abettors. The Penal Code provides that abettors are to be punished under s 109 if the abetted offence was committed as a consequence of the abetment, and, if the offence was not committed in consequence of the abetment, s 116 is to be applied. If the offence was committed, the abettor is liable to face the full punishment for that offence. This consequence is provided for in clear terms by s 109. If the offence was not committed, the abettor faces at most one-fourth of the full punishment prescribed for that offence. This outcome is also clearly provided for by s 116. Accordingly, on a plain and logical reading of the provisions, if a criminal conspirator is to be punished “as if” he is an abettor, his punishment equally depends on whether the substantive offence underlying the conspiracy is actually committed.1333 I am bolstered in this view by the decision of Chan Seng Onn J in Lau Cheng Kai and others v Public Prosecutor [2019] 3 SLR 374 (“Lau Cheng Kai”). The appellants in this matter were each convicted of one charge under s 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed). On appeal, they challenged both their conviction and sentence. As an aside, it should be noted this provision in the Prevention of Corruption Act has not been amended since Lau Cheng Kai; as such, the provision under consideration in this case was the same as that cited by Mr Wijaya as a basis to distinguish criminal conspiracies under s 120B of the Penal Code from s 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (2020 Rev ed) (see [1326] above).1334 One of the arguments raised by the appellants against their sentence was that they ought to be punished under s 116 of the Penal Code as the Prevention of Corruption Act did not contain a separate punishment for abetments or criminal conspiracies. This contention was rejected on several grounds, and Chan J reasoned as follows (Lau Cheng Kai at [40]–[44]):40  On a related note, the Appellants argue that the [Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”)] does not have a separate punishment provision for abetments or criminal conspiracies, and therefore they should be punished with reference to the punishments provided for the offences which they have been deemed to have committed. Further, given that “criminal conspiracy” under the PCA is to be understood as “criminal conspiracy” within the meaning of the Code, the said punishments must reflect s 120B read with s 116 of the Code which states the punishment for criminal conspiracy where the offence is not committed in consequence of the conspiracy. I respectfully disagree for three reasons.41  First, s 31 of the PCA states that “criminal conspiracy” is to be understood within the “meaning of the Penal Code” [emphasis added], which suggests that only the definition of “criminal conspiracy” (see s 120A of the Code) is to be imported from the Code into the PCA. However, s 31 does not state that the punishment for criminal conspiracy under the PCA shall be the same as that provided for in the Code. Therefore, a plain reading of the provision does not support the contention that the punishment provisions for criminal conspiracy in the Code are imported into the PCA.42  Second, the Appellants are mistaken in stating that the PCA does not have a separate punishment provision for abetments or criminal conspiracy. Sections 29 and 31 of the PCA state that offenders “shall be liable on conviction to be punished with the punishment provided for that [PCA] offence”. This specifically provides for the mechanism by which abettors and conspirators for offences under the PCA are to be punished. Therefore, there is no need to have recourse to the punishment provisions under the Code.43  Third, even taking the Appellants’ case at its highest and assuming that we can import the punishment provisions from the Code into the PCA, the correct provision should be s 120B of the Code read with s 109, and not s 116. Section 120B read with s 109 of the Code states that if the act which is the subject of the criminal conspiracy is committed in consequence of the conspiracy, the conspirator shall “be punished with the punishment provided for the offence”. Given that s 31 of the PCA expressly deems that the offence which is the subject of the criminal conspiracy has been committed, s 109 is the more appropriate section as opposed to s 116 which provides for the punishment when the offence is not committed in consequence of the conspiracy.44  It should be highlighted that the “operative part” of s 109, ie, “punished with the punishment provided for the offence”, is phrased in substantially the same way as in s 31 of the PCA. Section 109 of the Code only relates to situations where the offence is factually committed in consequence of the criminal conspiracy. Therefore, it is illogical for a sentencing judge punishing an offender under s 109 of the Code to give a sentencing discount on the basis that the offence was factually not committed. Hence, the only logical interpretation of s 109 is that a conspirator who is punished under that provision should be sentenced on the basis that the offence was committed, ie, the Second Interpretation. Given that the “operative parts” of s 109 of the Code and s 31 of the PCA are both phrased in broadly the same way, this gives rise to the inference that both these provisions should be understood to operate in the same way.[cross-references omitted; emphasis added]1335 Although the point placed before me was not exactly that addressed by Chan J in Lau Cheng Kai, his decision supported my conclusion and needs no further explanation. Indeed, quite apart from the fact that my reading of s 109, s 116, and s 120B of the Penal Code (and, equally, Chan J’s) was borne out by the phrase “as if he had abetted such offence” used in s 120B, it was also preferable because it avoided the highly curious solution proposed by Mr Wijaya. As would have been gathered from the submissions reproduced at [1328] above, accepting Mr Wijaya’s analysis would have left a lacuna in the legislation which Mr Wijaya ultimately had to plug by analogous reference to s 116. If no such reference had been made, there would have been no general sentencing provisions applicable to offenders convicted of entering criminal conspiracies. Not only was this argument unusual, it also begged the question – if analogous reference could be made to s 116, why could it also not be made to s 109.1336 After all, although one may argue that establishing a charge for criminal conspiracy might demand less of the Prosecution than establishing a charge for abetment by conspiracy (though, given the reforms brought about by the CLRA 2019, this observation may be less appropriate now: see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2022) at paras 33.49–33.54), so long as the Prosecution wishes to pursue the full punishment available for the offence forming the subject matter of the conspiracy, on the basis that such offence had been committed, the Prosecution is obliged to prove the commission of the offence. As a matter of logic and fairness, this burden of proof is not and cannot be any different from that which has to be satisfied had the Prosecution instead brought charges for the underlying substantive offence. There can also be no objection that such an approach enables the Prosecution to “hedge their bets”, so to speak. As observed by the Indian Supreme Court in Kandimalla Subbaiah, it is open to the Prosecution to bring charges for both conspiracy and the completed offences.1337 The real objection to cases like the present, where the Prosecution only brings charges for conspiracy, and not separate charges for the completed criminal offence, is whether the conspiracy charges framed make sufficiently clear that the charges against the accused persons are not only that they entered into criminal conspiracies, but that their conspiracies were carried out successfully. This brings me to my second reason for rejecting Mr Sreenivasan and Mr Wijaya’s arguments on this issue.1338 The fact that s 109 and s 116 of the Penal Code have different sentencing consequences was precisely why – when the Prosecution applied in 2019 to amend their charges for abetment by conspiracy to charges for criminal conspiracy – I invited them

 to consider inserting the specific provision on which they wished to rely for the purposes of sentencing; ie, either s 109 or s 116. The Prosecution was initially reluctant to do so. This was because, although they had taken the clear position that the underlying offences had been committed and that they were setting out to prove that to be the case, they were also of the view that including an express reference to s 109 in the charges would have the effect of imposing on them the additional requirement to prove the commission of the underlying offences when that was not needed to establish liability for criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code.

 Thus, it was clear to him that, if the Prosecution proved the full extent of its case, the accused persons would be liable to face the full punishment for the offences underlying the criminal conspiracies alleged.1339 Third, at the time the charges were amended, I left open what would follow if the Prosecution succeeded in proving that the accused persons entered into the various criminal conspiracies forming the subject matter of the charges, but failed to prove that the offences underlying those conspiracies had been committed. Given the Prosecution’s clear and positive case that the underlying offences had been committed, that bridge only needed to be crossed if I came to such a conclusion. However, as things turned out, that contingency was irrelevant. On 5 May 2022, when I delivered my oral judgment on the accused persons’ criminal liability, I made very clear my findings that the underlying False Trading,

 offences had been committed. It therefore followed that the accused persons ought to be sentenced in accordance with s 109 as provided in the charges brought against them. Given Mr Sreenivasan’s clear understanding of what the inclusion of s 109 in the charges entailed, Mr Sui’s alignment with Mr Sreenivasan’s position, and my decision on liability, there was no basis for the suggestion that the accused persons should be sentenced in accordance with s 116 of the Penal Code and not s 109.Alleged prosecutorial delay warranting a sentencing discount1340 I now turn to the second general argument raised only by Mr Wijaya.1341 In essence, Mr Wijaya submitted on behalf of the Second Accused that there had been a prosecutorial delay and that a “substantial” sentencing discount ought to be given to her on account of the prejudice arising from such delay. In respect of the personal challenges faced by the Second Accused, Mr Wijaya highlighted that, having “lost everything” in the Crash, she then had to experience extended periods of uncertainty as well as unemployment in 2014 and 2015, following the Crash but prior to the accused persons being charged in 2016. Thus, as a result, she had to undergo counselling for depression during this period. Mr Wijaya also pointed out that the Second Accused was not allowed to travel during investigations and the trial, and thus, could not return to Malaysia to visit her parents during periods of their illness.

1342 As to the procedural challenges faced by the Second Accused, Mr Wijaya submitted that there were prosecutorial delays in providing relevant material. He suggested that the Second Accused was “placed at a significant forensic disadvantage due to the late disclosure of [the CAD statements of Mr Gwee and Mr Tai] and [landline recordings between the accountholders and the TRs]”. Mr Wijaya added that this deprived the Second Accused of material which could have been used to cross-examine witnesses such as Mr Alex Chew, Mr Ong KC, Mr Lim TL and Mr Jack Ng. Such material, he said, was only provided at an “advanced stage” of the proceedings where recalling these witnesses would have had limited utility for the Second Accused’s defence.

1343 The manner in which prosecutorial delay is to be analysed and treated is generally settled (see Tan Kiang Kwang v Public Prosecutor [1995] 3 SLR(R) 746 (“Tan Kiang Kwang”) at [20]; Chan Kum Hong Randy v Public Prosecutor [2008] 2 SLR(R) 1019 (“Randy Chan”) at [15]–[38]; and Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council and another matter [2017] 5 SLR 356 at [108]–[126]). Put simply, before the court can even turn its mind to whether a sentencing discount may appropriately be given (and, if so, what that discount should be), there are two questions which need to be answered. The first question is whether there has even been a material delay to the commencement or conduct of the prosecution. If it cannot be said that there has been such a delay, the inquiry is simply irrelevant. Whether a delay is material, in turn, depends on the prejudice it causes to the accused person. As V K Rajah JA put the point in Randy Chan (at [22]):It must be reiterated that the significance of a delay in prosecution, if any, in the context of criminal justice hinges primarily on the effect of such a delay on the accused. This can be categorised for easier analysis under two headings: (a) considerations of fairness; and (b) the repercussions of delay on the offender’s effective rehabilitation and reintegration into society.1344 In respect of the first heading, after considering a few local and Australian authorities, Rajah JA said that their “central thread” was the “judicial concern to ensure (procedural) fairness in the administration of justice” (Randy Chan at [25]). “Fairness” and “unfairness” being patently broad terms could mean a variety of things. Therefore, an example Rajah JA cited (at [24]) was Tan Kiang Kwang, where Yong Pung How CJ stated that unfairness may result from prosecutorial delay if the accused has to “suffer the stress and uncertainty of having the matter [hang] over his head for an unduly long or indefinite period” (at [20]). Next, in respect of the second heading, the sort of repercussions Rajah JA had in mind were those which had the effect of disrupting an accused person’s efforts at rehabilitation and reintegration. This is clear from his statement that it was, in his view, “certainly unjust and unfair to punish in stages, in dribs and drabs so to speak, where it is entirely possible to punish comprehensively once and for all” (at [26]). The second heading was thus clearly irrelevant to the present case and it sufficed for me to assess Mr Wijaya’s points against the marker of “fairness” or, conversely, “unfairness”.1345 If a material delay could be established, the second question to be answered was who or what was the cause of the delay. If the delay was caused by the accused person himself, the inquiry hardly needs to be taken further. As Rajah JA stated in Randy Chan: “[i]n cases where the delay is attributable to the offender’s own misconduct (eg, where the offender has evaded detection, destroyed evidence, actively misled the police or been less than forthcoming to the investigating authorities), the offender cannot complain of the delay in prosecution, much less seek to opportunistically extract some mitigating credit from it. To allow the offender in such a scenario any discount in sentencing would be contrary to all notions of justice” (at [32]–[33]). If, however, the delay results from extended investigations, the assessment of such delay needs to be conducted in the context of the nature of those investigations. Complex cases obviously require more time and uncomplicated cases do not need as much. In this connection, Rajah JA aptly stated in Randy Chan (at [36]):[T]he length of delay involved must always be assessed in the context of the nature of the investigations – viz, whether the case involves complex questions of fact which necessarily engender meticulous and laborious inquiry over an extended period, or whether the case may be disposed of in a relatively uncomplicated manner (for instance, where the offender has fully admitted to his complicity). In the former scenario, an extended period of investigations might not only be expected, but also necessary and vital to uncover sufficient evidence to bring the accused to trial. This is likely to be the case for offences which often, by their nature, resist straightforward inquiry (for instance, sexual offences against young or vulnerable victims and financial fraud involving complex accounting and multi-jurisdictional issues).1346 Answering these questions in the present case was straightforward. As to the first question, I was not persuaded that the personal hardships faced by the Second Accused in 2014 and 2015 prior to being charged engendered such a degree of unfairness that it was necessary for this court to take it into account to “ensure (procedural) fairness in the administration of justice” (Randy Chan at [25]). To begin, that the Second Accused was said to have “lost everything” in the Crash could not be a relevant consideration in light of my decision on liability. Taking this into account would have given her credit for her own criminal conduct.1347 I turn then to the two-year period of uncertainty and unemployment the Second Accused suffered, as well as her resultant depression. Even if I had assumed for her benefit that the degree of her depression was severe, the extent of the delay cannot, in my view, be said to have been “unfair” to her. Some anxiety and uncertainty are to be expected when one is being investigated for criminal acts. Although the Second Accused’s passport was seized, I was not told that she could not even ask for an exception to return to Malaysia to visit her parents.1348 Furthermore, and this brings me to the second question I need to answer, a two-plus-year-long investigation could hardly have been said to be unduly long when considered against the immense volume of documents and facts which needed to be processed. The case was complex; this much was self-evident. However, a specific point which was more pertinent was the fact that the investigation served to uncover wrongdoing stretching over more than one year. It seems to me unreasonable to expect the investigators to have proceeded at a pace faster than they did. Indeed, if I were to conclude that the investigators could have acted faster in this case, that would seem to perversely incentivise would-be offenders to devise even more complex and difficult-to-unravel criminal schemes.1349 In relation to the procedural challenges faced by the Second Accused, I did not think Mr Wijaya’s submissions hit the mark. The court examines the extent and causes of prosecutorial delay with a view to determining whether the accused person should be given a sentencing discount. That the Second Accused was supposedly “disadvantaged” as a result of the allegedly delayed disclosure of forensic materials is a wholly separate point and engaged two different issues. First, whether the Prosecution was justified in not making disclosure initially, and, second, whether the delayed disclosure and its consequential impact on the conduct of the proceedings ought to affect the court’s view of the evidence and thus, the facts. However, I did not understand Mr Wijaya to be going down this path and, thus, did not take the argument on that basis. I therefore need not say more about this now.1350 In summary, I did not agree that the Second Accused ought to receive a discount on her sentence on account of “prosecutorial delay”. The arguments raised by Mr Wijaya simply did not show that there has been any delay at all, much less one which justified a “substantial discount”.1351 For completeness, although this was not a submission raised by Mr Wijaya when he addressed me on the issue of the Second Accused’s sentence, I should highlight that, after the Second Accused’s first set of lawyers from Harry Elias Partnership discharged themselves at the close of the Prosecution’s case, but prior to her instructing Eugene Thuraisingam LLP at the sentencing stage of these proceedings, the Second Accused represented herself. Whilst representing herself during this period, the Second Accused had also suggested that there had been prosecutorial delay in the conduct of the trial which caused her to run out of funds. This, in turn, resulted in her having to represent herself in an exceedingly complex dispute, which she said was prejudicial. In support of this contention, the Second Accused pointed to the Prosecution’s pre-trial estimate that the trial would be completed under 100 days and the fact that the Prosecution issued numerous notices under s 231 of the CPC during the trial, thus causing the proceedings to be extended. I firmly rejected this suggestion. Though the trial was longer than initially anticipated, an examination of how the trial unfolded would readily demonstrate that the amount of time spent in these proceedings was at least as much a consequence of the decisions made by the Defence as it was of those made by the Prosecution.The False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges1352 I now turn proper to my analysis of the appropriate sentences for the charges, beginning with the ten False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. As stated at [1319] above, for each of these ten charges, the accused persons were potentially liable – under s 120B of the Penal Code read with s 109 of the same, as well as s 204(1) of the SFA – to face a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, a fine not exceeding S$250,000, or both.Aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution1353 For the purposes of determining where along this prescribed sentencing range the accused persons fell, the Prosecution submitted that the court ought to take into consideration seven aggravating factors applicable to both accused persons. These were: (a) the immense scale and sophistication of the Scheme;

Ambition and design[The First Accused] boasted that he was building a “10 billion mining group”. He aimed to achieve this through a combination of market manipulation and corporate deals financed by the manipulated shares.Web of accountholders and network of TRsThe manipulation was achieved using 187 accounts in the names of 58 accountholders, and a syndicate of more than 20 complicit TRs and intermediaries. These included trusted accomplices and skilled market players to whom, at points, the Accused Persons delegated the roles of conducting the “market operations”.Period of offending and planningThe market manipulation took place over 14 months. It was highly planned. There was co-ordination in the placing of orders. Trading positions and losses were recorded. Shareholding numbers were tracked. Office premises were used as bases of operation. A finance manager and other employees were co-opted to manage incoming and outgoing payments for the scheme.Amount of manipulative tradingThe trading volume created by the Controlled Accounts was staggering: 3.4 billion shares (Asiasons), 1.15 billion shares (Blumont), and 4.4 billion shares (LionGold). Even more staggering was the proportion of the total market volume represented by the Controlled Accounts: 88% (Asiasons), 60% (Blumont) and 90% (LionGold).[emphasis in original]1355 Second, as regards “steps taken to evade detection”, it was said that:

The [a]ccused [p]ersons deliberately used as many accountholder names as possible to create the impression of genuine trading. By trading through omnibus accounts at private banks which do not show up in the market as being tagged to a specific accountholder, they also created an “additional layer” for regulators which made it difficult to detect wash trades. They relayed instructions through intermediaries and accountholders. On multiple occasions, [the First Accused] even impersonated accountholders to give instructions to TRs and to negotiate with the FIs.The [a]ccused [p]ersons used modes of communication that made tracing difficult – eg, phones registered in other persons’ names – and approved of their accomplices doing the same. They used trading methods designed to evade surveillance – they sought to avoid “direct” wash trades between two accounts of the same nominee accountholder and instructed multiple TRs to make their trades appear like “retail” trades. After the crash, they both sought to destroy evidence and frustrate the course of investigations.[emphasis in original]1356 Third, in respect of the accused persons’ “abuse of mechanisms designed to facilitate genuine trading”, the Prosecution pointed to: (a) their “exploitation” of the then-T+5 contra trading system by carrying out continuous “rolling” of BAL shares so as to increase these counters’ ostensible trading volume and liquidity; (b) their abuse of the trading limits and margin financing extended by the FIs; and (c) their moving of “large quantities of BAL shares from one Controlled Accountholder to another, [thereby] misusing the CDP share assignment process”.

1357 Fourth, in support of their allegation that the Scheme had “transnational elements”, the Prosecution called attention to the fact that “many” Relevant Accountholders were Malaysian nationals based in Malaysia. This, they said, was a contingency of the First Accused, who planned, after the Crash, “to push the blame to the Malaysian accountholders (who remained outside of jurisdiction) in order to prevent the discovery of the truth of [the First Accused’s] involvement” (also see [1247]–[1248] above).

 As to the “impact” of the Crash, the Prosecution cited various news articles by Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal and Reuters to make the point that Singapore’s reputation as an efficient capital market with robust regulators and enforcement agencies, had been damaged. This, in turn, translated into a loss of confidence and a dip in listings and market capitalisation.

By 1 October 2013, the market prices of Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold were 3,112%, 1,514% and 464% of their implied share prices (based on fair market value).The sustained manipulation of BAL shares meant that the price bore no correlation to the reality of BAL’s value. When the share prices eventually crashed, S$7.8 billion in market capitalisation of the three companies was erased, sending shockwaves through the Singapore market.There was considerable damage to the market’s reputation. Listing and trading volumes on SGX fell significantly in the months after the Crash.1359 Sixth, the Prosecution submitted that the financial losses suffered by market participants as of 7 October 2013,

 apart from the losses suffered in the Controlled Accounts by the Controlled Accountholders, amounted to more than S$530 million.

 It bears highlighting, however, that this figure was the higher of two figures derived from alternative methods of calculating loss put forth by the Prosecution in their sentencing submissions. (a) The first method, from which the figure of S$532 million was derived, sought to measure the loss “suffered by identified market participants as a result of the Crash”. To do so, the Prosecution calculated, using the relevant SGX exhibits,
                   2454

  PSS at para 162.



 (b) The second method, which reflected that the market participants had suffered a loss of around S$245 million as of 7 October 2013, sought to calculate “only the ‘out-of-pocket’ losses suffered by the identified market participants”. Such calculation was done by “taking the net BAL shareholdings that [the market participants] held as at the end of 4 October 2013”, “calculating the difference in the amount that such persons paid for their shares on the one hand and the market value of those shares following the [C]rash on the other hand”.

This reveal[ed] what was at stake and underscore[d] their dishonest intent” [emphasis added].

 1361 Two points need to be emphasised. One, the Prosecution was not relying on the accused persons’ alleged gains per se as a factor which aggravated the severity of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. Instead, relying on Soh Guan Cheow Anthony v Public Prosecutor [2017] 3 SLR 147 (“Anthony Soh”), where See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) stated that “dishonesty can be regarded as an aggravating factor precisely in those circumstances where it is not an element of the offence” [emphasis in original] (at [176]), the Prosecution submitted that – as dishonesty is not an element of an offence under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, nor of criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code, that the accused persons were dishonest should be taken as an aggravating factor. Two, like their calculation of the losses suffered by market participants, the Prosecution proposed alternative calculations of the accused persons’ supposed gains.

1362 Beyond these seven aggravating factors raised in connection with the Scheme as a whole, and, thus, applicable to both accused persons (albeit to varying degrees, given the differences in their respective roles in the Scheme: see [1382] below), as regards the Second Accused alone, the Prosecution additionally submitted that she had abused her position as the CEO of IPCO. This, the Prosecution submitted, was an aggravating factor recognised in Public Prosecutor v Chia Teck Leng [2004] SGHC 68 (“Chia Teck Leng”) where Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) said: “the banks believed, and rightly so, that they were dealing with a responsible head of finance of an established company. That is why the law regards abuse of positions of trust as an aggravating factor” (at [34]).

 for the purposes of the Scheme. In so doing, the Prosecution argued that the Second Accused was acting in breach of her duties as an authorised signatory to those accounts, and as a director of those companies.Sentences proposed by the Prosecution1363 On the basis that the aforementioned factors were accepted as aggravating the severity of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, the Prosecution proposed the following sentences for these charges:

The Prosecution had suggested that three sentences be ordered to run consecutively in respect of the First Accused, but only two in respect of the Second Accused. The aggravating factors taken into account1365 In my view, the seven aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution (apart from that concerning the Second Accused’s alleged abuse of her position as CEO of IPCO) were more logically grouped around four broader categories:(a) First, the scale of the Scheme;(b) Second, the sophistication of the Scheme;(c) Third, the harm caused by the Scheme; and(d) Fourth, the gains made from the Scheme.(1) The scale of the Scheme1366 I begin with the first category. It was clear to me that the Scheme was of substantial scale. To be specific, there were two separate dimensions: (a) duration; and (b) size and volume.1367 As to the first dimension, the accused persons’ Scheme took place over a period of about 14 months and there can be no doubt that this was lengthy. Although this total duration comprises charges split between the periods before and after 18 March 2013, this was a consequence necessitated by the 2013 SFA amendments and did not detract from the lengthy overall period of offending. In fact, when this case was compared to the precedents – namely, Anthony Soh, Lau Wan Heng v Public Prosecutor [2022] 3 SLR 1067 (“Lau Wan Heng”), Ng Geok Eng, and Wong Leon Keat

 – it was obvious that the present case was unprecedented in terms of the length for which the accused persons were able to sustain, perpetuate, and conceal the Scheme. Thus, in sentencing the accused persons, I gave due weight to this, which I viewed as a fairly substantial aggravating factor.1368 The second dimension concerned the sheer size of the Scheme in terms of both its building blocks as well as in its ultimate execution. There could be no doubt that the Scheme was extremely large in terms of the basic foundations on which it had been built. As I determined, it involved the control and use of 187 trading accounts held in the names of 59 unique accountholders (not including Ms Cheng, whose personal accounts I found not to have been controlled: see [727] above), held with 20 FIs. There were also more than 20 TRs and intermediaries involved in the management and use of these accounts. As a starting point, these foundations set the Scheme up to be of considerable scale, and, indeed, that was exactly what it turned out to be. The next largest case of a similar nature was probably Lau Wan Heng, which involved a total of 53 trading accounts opened in the names of 15 individuals with eight FIs. While that matter also involved a sizeable scheme, it was dwarfed by that of the accused persons.1369 During the Relevant Period, these 187 controlled Relevant Accounts were responsible for around 60% of Blumont trades carried out in the market, 88% of Asiasons shares traded, and 90% of the LionGold shares traded. The absolute volume of BAL shares traded during this period was also substantial. In respect of Blumont, the volume was around 1.15 billion; for Asiasons, it was around 3.42 billion; and for LionGold, it was around 4.38 billion.

 Not every one of these trades deployed an illegitimate technique. For example, not every BAL trade executed in these accounts was a wash. There were trades which sold shares to or bought shares from non-controlled accounts. However, this was not to the credit of the accused persons as such trades also had the effect of inflating the liquidity of BAL shares. Ultimately, the crucial question was the extent to which the accused persons ought to be held responsible for the high volume of BAL trades executed in the 187 accounts. As I explained at [1307]–[1316] above, my answer to this question was a qualitative “most”. Thus, when sentencing the accused persons, I bore this finding in mind.(2) The sophistication of the Scheme1370 I turn to the next category of aggravating factors relating to the sophistication of the Scheme. In short, it was clear to me that a great deal of planning and premeditation went into the development and design of the Scheme. The Scheme also had lofty ambitions; it was not merely designed to manipulate the market in the short term for quick and easy profits (contrast, for example, Tan Chong Koay (CA) at [186] above). The evidence supported the conclusion that the Scheme was meant, in the long-term, to inflate the liquidity and value of BAL shares to a point where they could be used as “currency” for corporate deals (see [850] above). Indeed, if the Scheme had achieved this objective, it may even have been perversely successful in providing post hoc legitimacy to the increase in liquidity and prices of BAL shares during the Relevant Period.1371 There were numerous other markers of the Scheme’s sophistication. I do not intend, however, to list them exhaustively. Instead, I only highlight the two which I found most pertinent and aggravating.(a) The first concerned the many layers within the Scheme which made detection of wrongdoing very difficult. These layers included: the large number of accounts and accountholders, including foreigners, which served to convey the impression of genuine trading activity; the accused persons’ use of TRs and intermediaries to create layers of separation between themselves and the trades; their use of trading accounts held with private banks which traded through omnibus accounts; and, in respect of the First Accused, even impersonation of accountholders.(b) The second concerned the manner in which the accused persons abused the mechanisms designed to facilitate genuine trading activity. I give a few examples. First, by exploiting contra trading on a rolling basis, the accused persons were initially able to inflate the liquidity of BAL shares without needing to have the corresponding capital. Second, when FIs started to accept BAL shares as collateral for the provision of margin financing – a result attributable at least in part to the increased liquidity and prices of BAL shares caused by the accused persons’ Scheme in its earlier stages – they obtained greater control over the pace and shape of the Scheme, and the Scheme itself attained more stability. Third, the accused persons were even able to abuse the SGX’s buy-in to turn illegitimate profits and to punish short-sellers (see [938]–[940] above).1372 There were several other examples of the sophistication of the Scheme. The point to be made is simply that the Scheme was elaborate, complex and highly exploitative, yet it was intricate and very tightly planned and managed, specifically with a view to avoiding detection. That the accused persons formulated and executed such a Scheme was highly aggravating and thus, when sentencing them, I gave this factor due weight.(3) The harm caused by the Scheme1373 Next, I address the third category of aggravating factors. These are related to the harm caused by the Scheme. The Prosecution had submitted that I ought to take into consideration both the general harm to the market as well as the specific financial losses suffered by market participants. In respect of the latter, the Prosecution had also invited me to determine that the market participants have suffered particular quanta of losses, those losses having been calculated by the Prosecution themselves in their submissions.1374 I accepted that the Scheme caused harm to the market generally as well as to its participants specifically. However, I rejected the Prosecution’s reliance on the specific losses which they calculated the market participants had suffered. I explain my decision on the latter point first.1375 To begin, the market participants’ specific losses were calculated by the Prosecution themselves and they proffered two potential methods by which the exact quantum of such losses should be calculated. While I accepted that their calculations had been derived from underlying materials in evidence, I nevertheless took the view that those calculations could and should have been canvassed during the trial. If that had been done, the Defence would not only have had the opportunity to verify such calculations in cross-examination of the witness adducing such calculations, possibly Professor Aitken, but, more importantly, they would have had the chance to press the witness on which type of losses should more appropriately be treated as a market participant’s true “loss”.1376 That being said, even without the market participants’ losses properly calculated and characterised through a witness, there were still two useful and separate barometers which indicated to me the severity of the harm caused by the Scheme, and which I took into consideration.(a) The first was the loss of around S$7.8 billion in market capitalisation following the Crash. It was axiomatic that this stark drop in the value of BAL shares would have caused all BAL shareholders (still holding on to shares at the time of the Crash) to lose money. I was mindful that, given the Scheme, the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts would have had a substantial BAL shareholding, and, thus, would have been the ones to suffer a proportionate amount of the total losses resulting from the Crash. In this connection, as of 30 September 2013, those accounts held approximately 77.35%, 56.96% and 58.56% of the total shareholding in BAL respectively.

  IO-Ha; note that, though the precise percentages would include any BAL shares held in the two accounts of Ms Cheng which were found not to have been controlled, there would not have been any major impact to these percentages.



 That the controlled Relevant Accounts were not the only ones holding BAL shares at the time of the Crash was a clear indication of the fact that those holding onto the remaining BAL shares would have suffered proportionate losses. In any event, the fact that the controlled Relevant Accounts were holding a substantial portion of BAL shares prior to the Crash did not mean that the accused persons were the ones who suffered the remaining losses in those accounts in full.(b) This brings me to the second barometer. Representatives from the FIs gave evidence as to the losses which they have not been able to recover from the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts. Totalling up those sums yielded a figure of around S$377 million across all 187 accounts. However, as this sum included the unrecovered losses suffered by the controlled Relevant Accounts themselves, which also formed the subject of the six Cheating Charges, it was proper – in order to avoid double-counting – to exclude the unrecovered losses suffered in those six accounts. Even doing so, this left a substantial sum of around S$273 million.

 This was another good indication of the amount of harm caused by the accused persons’ Scheme because most of such losses to the FIs – which may have been reduced by partial post-crash repayments – would have resulted from the drop in value of BAL shares. To my mind, these matters painted a clear enough picture of the extent of the harm from the Scheme.1377 Next, as regards the harm suffered by the market more generally, the Defence had objected to the reference made in the Prosecution’s submissions to articles by Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal and Reuters to illustrate the general damage caused to the Singapore securities market.

 The objection was that these articles had not been adduced as evidence. This was a fair objection and I accepted it accordingly. However, in the event, I did not think it mattered. The articles, in my view, were not needed to prove the harm to the market. It could not seriously be doubted, given the scale of the Scheme and the resultant Crash, that the securities market suffered no harm. That would have been a naïvely artificial view to take, and, given the facts of the present case, it would have also been technical to say that the Prosecution had not adduced specific pieces of evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt – as a general proposition – that the Singapore market had been harmed. Put simply, that such general harm had been caused was self-evident on the case constructed and proved by the Prosecution. I therefore accepted that the market suffered harm (including reputational damage). When the fact that there has been harm was taken into account alongside the substantial loss in market capitalisation as well as the scale and sophistication of the Scheme, I was satisfied that this accurately captured the full picture necessary for the court to arrive at an appropriate sentencing position.(4) The gains made from the Scheme1378 I now turn to the gains made by the accused persons from the Scheme. As mentioned at [1360] above, the Prosecution put forth their own calculations of the accused persons’ gains. As with their calculations of the market participants’ losses, I found that these could and should have been adduced through a witness, again, possibly Professor Aitken, and I therefore declined to take them into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.1379 Nevertheless, I accepted that the Scheme was carried out for the purpose of financial gains, and there must have been some general upside to the accused persons’ execution of their Scheme before the Crash. I was mindful that the Crash probably put an end to whatever upside the accused persons’ criminal conduct may have produced. However, it did not follow that they gained nothing from the Scheme. In fact, for example, as I mentioned at [938]–[940] above, Mr Leroy Lau and the accused persons used their substantial BAL shareholding to take advantage of an SGX buy-in. Apart from punishing market participants short-selling LionGold shares, it would also have allowed the accused persons to profit from the buy-in; an upside which would not otherwise have been obtainable if they had not been operating the Scheme. Indeed, this incident was a particularly appropriate one to bear in mind. As See J observed in Anthony Soh at [176]–[177]:176  Dishonesty can often be inferred from the motives and conduct of an offender who is convicted of insider trading offences, such as those which formed the subject-matter of the 1st to 7th charges. However, with respect, the District Judge had erred in his reasoning. There is no requirement in law to prove dishonesty as an ingredient of the s 218(2)(b) SFA charges for insider trading. In my view, dishonesty can be regarded as an aggravating factor precisely in those circumstances where it is not an element of the offence. …177  It is also apposite to note that there are various shades of dishonesty that could be taken into account. As highlighted by the Prosecution, factors that may affect the colour of an offender’s dishonesty include: (a) the size of the gain to be obtained; (b) whether the dishonest gain was intended to benefit oneself only, as opposed to benefitting others; and (c) the identity and characteristics of the victims at whom the dishonest conducted is targeted.1380 The gains made in connection with the aforementioned buy-in were, in the first place, probably not insubstantial given the number of LionGold shares involved (5,954,000). However, quite beyond the earnings which would have been made in connection with this incident, the goal the accused persons had – of punishing the persons shorting LionGold’s shares

 – gave this incident a particularly sinister complexion. I am mindful that such incidents did not arise in respect of every False Trading and Price Manipulation Charge, and that this specific incident only concerned the tenth charge. However, as I generally accepted that the accused persons would have gained from the Scheme, at least whilst it was operating, I gave weight to this consideration.(5) The Second Accused’s abuse of position1381 Lastly, I turn to the factor relevant only to the Second Accused. In sum, I agreed with the Prosecution that – in carrying out the Scheme – the Second Accused abused her position as CEO of IPCO. Indeed, in my view, given the evidence adduced, this was hardly controversial. I thus gave this factor due weight when arriving at the sentences to be imposed on her.The Second Accused’s relative culpability in respect of the Scheme1382 At this juncture, I need to address the Second Accused’s culpability relative to the First Accused in respect of the ten False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. This issue arose because Mr Wijaya contended that the Second Accused was less culpable than the First, and he also specifically took issue with the use of the term “co-mastermind” to describe the Second Accused’s role in the Scheme alongside the First Accused.

1383 It seems to me that the objection was not completely unfounded. Indeed, on the evidence given by Ms Cheng, even the First Accused had – apparently – jokingly referred to the Second Accused as a “girl Friday”.

 There was, however, in my view, no real dispute that the Second Accused was relatively less culpable. This was confirmed in the Prosecution’s written reply

 and was also evident from the fact that, in respect of the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, the Prosecution sought an 18-year aggregate sentence against the First Accused but only an eight-year aggregate sentence against the Second.1384 That said, I note that, notwithstanding the Prosecution’s recognition that the Second Accused was relatively less culpable, they maintained the position that she should still be regarded as the First Accused’s “co-mastermind”.

 While I did not disagree with such a characterisation of the Second Accused’s role as a “co-mastermind”, I was not persuaded that the label was particularly useful for the purpose of sentencing. The basic and undisputed point was that although the Second Accused was a co-conspirator, she was relatively less culpable than the First Accused. As such, the issue which needed to be pinned down was how much less and why. This issue needed to be addressed by reference to the Second Accused’s actual involvement at each stage of the Scheme: beginning from its conceptualisation; to the laying of its foundations; and to its execution, not only in terms of her performance of acts in furtherance of the Scheme, but also in terms of the decision-making powers she exercised along the way to meet the objectives of, or manage difficulties affecting, the Scheme.1385 On my examination of the evidence adduced at trial that potentially bore on these matters, the Second Accused was less involved in the Scheme in terms of its conceptualisation and in aspects of its execution, but she was equally – if not more – involved in laying its foundations. I explain.(a) This final point could be gleaned from the sizeable number of accounts the Second Accused pulled into the Scheme, including those held in her own name, those held in the name of companies under her control, and those in respect of which the accountholders were content to relinquish control to her formally

 or informally.(b) However, in so far as conceptualisation of the Scheme went, the Second Accused’s lesser involvement was discernible from her general absence where the management of BAL was concerned, specifically, in relation to the correspondence and meetings aimed at utilising the inflated BAL shares as currency for corporate deals. This was revealing. With a scheme as complex and multifaceted as this, and where both accused persons were already actively involved in its day-to-day affairs, one would expect the persons sitting at the apex to be particularly invested in matters relating to the Scheme’s broader purpose. Such interest and investment were more easily observed in respect of the First Accused. This suggested to me that he was more extensively involved in the conceptualisation of the Scheme, which accounts for why he took such an interest in seeking to materialise its broader purpose, this being one of which he conceived (see [850]–[881] above).(c) Next was the extent to which the Second Accused was involved in the execution of the Scheme. Although her involvement was considerable on the whole, the evidence showed that she was less involved in carrying out certain facets of the Scheme. For example, she appeared to have taken a backseat when it came to securing financing from Goldman Sachs and IB in the six accounts which formed the subject of the Cheating Charges. It was the First Accused who had taken the clear lead (see [1125]–[1147] above).1386 I regarded these examples as supporting the general conclusion that the Second Accused was relatively less culpable than the First as regards the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. There were certainly other granular details which could have been raised in support of this view. However, given that the relative difference in culpability was not even disputed by the Prosecution, I preferred to focus on the extent to which this should affect the sentences imposed on the Second Accused.1387 As may be discerned from the sentences proposed by the Prosecution for the Second Accused vis-à-vis the First Accused (see [1363] above), they did not apply a uniform proportion across the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, so as to recognise the accused persons’ relative difference in culpability. I could appreciate why they have not applied such a consistent proportion. The facts underlying each charge were different and, if one considered the minutiae of this case, the relative difference between the accused persons’ culpability may not have been identical in respect of each of these ten charges. Nevertheless, whether such minutiae ought to bear on the sentences to be imposed was questionable; and, in any event, applying a fixed proportion was, in my view, useful, at least as a starting point. On the material placed before me, I found that the Second Accused could generally be said to be two-thirds as culpable as the First Accused. Thus, as a starting point for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, and unless there were factors which suggested otherwise in respect of specific charges, I imposed on her two-thirds of the sentences I imposed on the First Accused.The appropriate sentence for each charge1388 Taking into consideration the relevant aggravating factors just discussed, and the overall difference between the accused persons’ relative culpabilities, I determined that the following sentences were appropriate:Charge NoChargeSentenceFirst AccusedSecond Accused 1 False Trading;Blumont;3 years’ imprisonment2 years’ imprisonment2 False Trading;Blumont;6 years’ imprisonment4 years’ imprisonment3 Price Manipulation;Blumont;2 years’ imprisonment1 year and 4 months’ imprisonment4 False Trading;Asiasons;4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment3 years’ imprisonment5 False Trading;Asiasons;6 years’ imprisonment4 years’ imprisonment6 Price Manipulation;Asiasons;2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment1 year and 8 months’ imprisonment7 Price Manipulation;Asiasons;2 years’ imprisonment1 year and 4 months’ imprisonment8 False Trading;LionGold;4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment3 years’ imprisonment9 False Trading;LionGold;6 years’ imprisonment4 years’ imprisonment10 Price Manipulation;LionGold;3 years’ imprisonment2 years’ imprisonment1389 Three points need to be highlighted in respect of these sentences:(a) First, I chiefly drew distinctions between the individual False Trading Charges based on the duration of the accused persons’ offending. That was why, for example, the sentence handed down in respect of Charge 1 was lower than that in respect of Charges 4 and 8.(b) Second, however, as regards Charges 1, 4 and 8, I also accorded less weight to the aggravating factor of harm because the negative impact of the accused persons’ Scheme in the first half of the Relevant Period was less than it was in the second half.(c) Third, relatively lighter terms of imprisonment were warranted for the Price Manipulation Charges because these charges involved substantially shorter periods of offending. I was mindful that price manipulation offences were more likely to be committed over shorter periods than false trading offences. That said, the Prosecution did not submit that there were factors which specifically aggravated the Price Manipulation Charges such that, notwithstanding the relatively shorter periods of those charges, the accused persons still ought to receive sentences equal to or greater than those which they should receive for the False Trading Charges. I therefore did not take such a view.1390 I will return to which of these ten charges ought to run consecutively after I explain the sentences I imposed on the accused persons in respect of the remaining groups of charges. The Deception Charges1391 I turn now to the 153 Deception Charges. The sentencing range prescribed by the SFA for these charges was the same as that prescribed for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. At the risk of repetition, that was a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, a fine not exceeding S$250,000 or both. That said, even though the applicable sentencing provisions were the same, there was no dispute that the Deception Charges involved wrongs that were of a generally less severe character than the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. The question which needed to be answered was how much less severe the Deception Charges were as compared with the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, and, for this, I begin with the aggravating factors advanced by the Prosecution.Aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution1392 In respect of the Deception Charges, the Prosecution submitted that I should take into account seven aggravating factors:(a) First, the scale and nature of the deceptive practice;(b) Second, the outstanding losses suffered by the FIs;(c) Third, that the deceptive practice was integral to the Scheme;(d) Fourth, the extensive use of the controlled Relevant Accounts;(e) Fifth, the use of TRs as accomplices;(f) Sixth, the accused persons’ dishonesty; and(g) Seventh, the existence of transnational elements. 1393 After careful consideration of the nature of the Deception Charges as well as the Prosecution’s and Defence’s arguments in this connection, I found that the second, third, fifth and sixth factors were not relevant and thus did not bear on the sentences to be imposed on the accused persons.1394 I did, however, agree with the Prosecution that the first, fourth and seventh factors were relevant. I will return to my views on the latter three factors shortly. First, I state why I did not accept the Prosecution’s arguments in respect of the second, third, fifth and sixth factors.The aggravating factors not taken into account1395 Before I explain my decision, it bears reiterating that the wrongful conduct forming the subject of the Deception Charges was quite broad. The accused persons were not accused of engaging in nominee trading; they were charged simply for concealing their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades in the various controlled accounts.1396 The Deception Charges were broadly drafted and represented a departure from the usual charge of unauthorised trading seen in the central case of Ng Geok Eng. Even though I eventually concluded that the Deception Charges framed could amount to an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA, that was on the footing that, even if nominee trading or illegal activity was not alleged in the charge, it was nevertheless important to guard against an individual’s (or, in this case, two individuals’) “involvement” in securities trading accounts, such involvement being an indicium of nominee trading or other unlawful trading activity. Therefore, though there was a legitimate interest to be protected by the Deception Charges formulated by the Prosecution, that interest was not quite so straightforward as flatly protecting FIs from the risks inherent in nominee trading or other forms of illegal trading activity.1397 With the scope of the Deception Charges in mind, I turn to the second aggravating factor proposed by the Prosecution. It should be emphasised that an aggravating factor must bear some conceptual connection with the conduct being sanctioned by the charge framed. In this regard, although the point may seem trite, it is useful to refer to Choo J’s decision in Public Prosecutor v Huang Hong Si [2003] 3 SLR(R) 57. There, he stated at [8]–[11]:8  What have frequently been labelled as “aggravating factors” are, therefore, more accurately factors that indicate the level of gravity of the crime in specific relation to the offence upon which the accused was charged. The degree of seriousness at each level differs according to the individual facts of the case. Such facts are not intended to be used to compare the crime of robbery with the crime of rape, for example. They are to be used to engage the court in the exercise of establishing how the offender is to be punished within the range of punishment prescribed for him for that offence. In this regard, the degree of seriousness of the crime has four major distinctive aspects. First, there is the degree of seriousness of the offence itself. This presents little difficulty because this aspect is usually reflected in the range of punishment prescribed by the legislature for the offence; although there is always room for moot, for example, as to whether the crime of fabricating evidence (for which the punishment is up to three years’ imprisonment) is a more serious offence than the crime of being a member of an unlawful assembly (for which the punishment is up to two years’ imprisonment).9  The second aspect of seriousness is the manner and mode in which it was committed. An accused who kills his victim with a single stab wound commits the same crime, but arguably, in a less brutal manner than one who crushes his victim to death with a truck as a weapon. Similarly, the offence of causing hurt is obviously more serious in a case where a person has been beaten several times (on the same occasion) than one who was hit only once (assuming the blows in both cases are roughly the same).10  The third aspect is the degree of seriousness of the consequences of the criminal act. One victim may die a quick death, another may linger in pain before expiring. No two cases may be alike, but the task of the court to consider the degree and scope of seriousness is incomplete if it merely takes into account individual factors and add them all together (even if that can be done). It is not a numbers game. The court’s duty is to consider all the factors, including the mitigation, as a blend and evaluating them as a whole.11  The fourth aspect concerns the interests of the public. What is in the public interest is not always readily palpable and it should therefore be invoked lest the crime be unjustifiably magnified.1398 I would add to this the perhaps obvious point that the aggravating factor in question must relate to the specific terms of the charge brought against the accused person or persons. In the present case, that the FIs suffered losses and continue to have outstanding losses did not, in my judgment, bear any conceptual connection to the broadly framed Deception Charges. To use the categories described by Choo J, these facts did not seem to increase the gravity of the deception offences themselves, the manner and mode in which those offences were carried, nor the consequences of those offences. This was because there were at least two degrees of separation between the very broad deception practised on the FIs by the accused persons, and the FIs’ losses.1399 The first degree of separation was that the deceptive practice alleged did not require the Prosecution to show that the accountholders were truly nominees. Although the accused persons were “involved” in instructing trades in the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts, the deceptive practice alleged did not, in and of itself, necessarily increase the risk of the FIs in relation to each account. Without proving that the accountholders were truly nominees in the sense seen in Ng Geok Eng, there was little to no risk that the accountholders would be able to viably dispute the trades carried out in their accounts. The FIs thus always had recourse against the Relevant Accountholders with whom they intended to deal, and whose risk profile they had assessed.1400 The second degree of separation was that the accused persons’ mere “involvement” in the instructing of orders and trades was not the misconduct which created the risk which ultimately caused the FIs to suffer the substantial losses they did. That was the fact that the accused persons were manipulating the liquidity and prices of BAL shares, large volumes of which were staked to the FIs and being held in accounts in their care. When the Crash occurred, it was the inflated character of the BAL shares which led to the FIs’ losses. This is precisely why, at [1376] above, I accepted that the harm caused to the FIs in terms of their unrecovered losses was a relevant consideration in sentencing the accused persons for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. They were clearly and directly connected, unlike the deceptive practice alleged by these charges and those same losses.1401 I turn to the Prosecution’s third factor. In my judgment, the third factor did not aggravate the Deception Charges because it was open to the Prosecution to formulate the deceptive practice in the charges as concealing not only the accused persons’ generic “involvement” in the instructing of orders and trades, but specifically that such instructions were given in pursuance of the broader objective of creating a false appearance as to the liquidity or prices of BAL shares. This would have required the Prosecution to prove more to make out each of the Deception Charges, but it is exactly because they would have had to establish more in relation to each of these charges that they would then be subsequently justified in saying that the charges were serious and that the accused persons ought to be punished more severely.1402 However, having chosen to prefer these more broadly framed Deception Charges, and separate False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, it appeared to me that the latter charges were already targeted at the overall mischief of the accused persons’ misconduct while the Deception Charges were directed at the mechanics of such overall misconduct. This being the case, factors which aggravated the Deception Charges ought to have been those which enhanced the sophistication of the accused persons’ chicanery and made it specifically harder to prevent or detect their “involvement” in the use of the controlled Relevant Accounts. After all, the accused persons could have been charged with false trading and price manipulation without also being charged with using a deceptive practice under s 201(b) of the SFA. Conversely, given the level of generality at which the Deception Charges were framed, the Prosecution could also theoretically have succeeded in proving the Deception Charges even if they were unable to establish the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges. Thus, not only was the overall purpose of the accused persons’ Scheme irrelevant to the deception effected on the FIs (as specifically particularised in the Deception Charges), taking this into account so as to aggravate the severity of the Deception Charges, would also be duplicative as I discuss from [1417]–[1419] below in relation to the Cheating Charges.1403 The next is the sixth factor raised by the Prosecution. In my judgment, the reasoning in respect of the third factor applied equally to the sixth factor. The Prosecution’s contention was that the accused persons intended “by concealing their involvement”

 to obtain wrongful gains. Specifically, they intended to secure financing from the FIs knowing that the FIs would not have provided such financing had they not been deceived as to the accused persons’ involvement with the 187 controlled Relevant Accounts. This, again, was not how the Prosecution framed the Deception Charges. The deceptive practice alleged, as stated, was the broad and unspecific claim that the accused persons concealed their involvement in the instructing of orders and trades. It was open to the Prosecution to state in the charges more particularly in terms of what the deception caused the FIs to do, but they chose not to. Having done so, I did not think it was open to them to suggest that such a factor ought to be viewed as aggravating the Deception Charges.1404 Lastly, I turn to the fifth factor. Although I agreed that the evidence showed that certain TRs – for example, Mr Wong XY – were opportunistic in terms of being content to receive commissions without asking questions and insisting upon the provision of written authorisation (see [44] above), it was not in issue during the trial whether they should be regarded as “accomplices”, as the Prosecution labelled them at the stage of sentencing. I thus did not think it was appropriate to regard them “accomplices” for the purpose of sentencing for the Deception Charges.The aggravating factors taken into account1405 Having disregarded the factors above, I took into account the remaining factors which the Prosecution submitted were aggravating. In sum, I accepted that the accused persons were “involved” in the use of an inordinately large number of trading accounts, held in the name of many accountholders, and that those accounts were each used extensively. I regarded these two factors as carrying a substantial amount of aggravating weight.1406 I also accepted the Prosecution’s argument that there were transnational elements in this matter because of the foreign Relevant Accountholders whose accounts formed the subject of a fair number of Deception Charges. However, as against the far more significant first and fourth factors, I did not regard this factor as carrying much weight.The appropriate sentence for each charge1407 I now turn to the appropriate sentence I determined ought to be imposed for each of the 153 Deception Charges. The Prosecution’s proposed sentences for each charge varied depending on the outstanding losses suffered by the FI in the account forming the subject of the charge, ranging from one to two years and six months of imprisonment for the First Accused and six months to one year and six months of imprisonment for the Second Accused.

 However, as I did not accept that the FIs’ losses formed a relevant aggravating factor, I also rejected the approach proposed by the Prosecution.1408 In fact, having rejected the aggravating factors I did, there was little basis for differentiation between each of the 153 Deception Charges. I accepted that there would have been some controlled Relevant Accounts that had been used more in connection with the Scheme, and others that would have been used less (see, eg, [1095] above). This could have been a basis to make minor adjustments between the charges. However, in my view, that was too granular to be meaningful, particularly in light of the fact that those accounts were used for a common objective. Indeed, it will be recalled from the evidence set out above that, unless it was to avoid wash trading, the accused persons generally did not instruct TRs or intermediaries on the specific account to use when placing BAL orders. They were typically left to use whichever account had available trading limits (see, eg, [463] and [622] above).

 Accordingly, a granular analysis of the usage rate of each and every Relevant Account would have been unmeaningful. I therefore considered a flat one-year term of imprisonment for both accused persons in respect of each of the 153 Deception Charges (ie, Charges 11 to 172 excluding Charges 96, 121, 122, 157, 158, 160 to 162 of which the accused persons were acquitted) to be appropriate.1409 I should add that I did not think the Second Accused was relatively less culpable in relation to the Deception Charges. As I have explained at [1402] above, these charges concerned the mechanics of the Scheme and the Second Accused was just as involved in executing the Scheme in this manner as the First Accused (see [1385] above).The Cheating Charges1410 I turn to the six Cheating Charges, which were the last of the Conspiracy Charges. Section 420 of the Penal Code provided that the accused persons could be punished with imprisonment for a term which could extend to ten years, and they were also liable to be fined.Aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution1411 The Prosecution submitted that for each of the six Cheating Charges, the First Accused ought to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment between eight years and six months and nine years. For the Second Accused, they sought sentences of between seven to eight years’ imprisonment.1412 To this end, they relied on seven aggravating factors. First, the large amounts that had been cheated in respect of each of the six charges, and in total.

It would be noticed that the Prosecution had suggested that two sentences be ordered to run consecutively in respect of the First Accused, but only one in respect of the Second Accused.The aggravating factors taken into account1415 In my view, it was uncontroversial that the first factor proposed by the Prosecution was the most aggravating. The higher the sum cheated, the greater the sentence to be imposed for a s 420 offence, and this was irrespective of the victim’s outstanding losses or the duration which was taken to cheat such sum. Thus, I gave the most weight to this factor.1416 To be clear, I did agree that the second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh factors advanced by the Prosecution were also relevant for the purposes of sentencing. However, given the quanta of monies cheated in this matter, I was not certain how significant those factors were. When compared against the precedents – particularly, Chia Teck Leng where the offender was sentenced to a global 42-year imprisonment term for, amongst other things, cheating four banks of S$117.1 million – the sheer amount of money cheated here for each charge, and more than S$820 million collectively, necessarily, required that the indicative starting sentences be placed at the highest end of the range prescribed by s 420 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, though these factors were relevant, they carried little to no weight in context.1417 This left the third factor raised by the Prosecution, namely, the illegal purpose for which the cheated funds were used. In respect of this, I agreed with the Defence that taking this into account for the purposes of the Cheating Charges amounted to double counting. I was mindful of the fact that this was not one of the situations of double counting raised in Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan [2018] 5 SLR 799 at [82]–[94], but as the learned Chief Justice noted at [91] of that decision, the instances which he was considering were not exhaustive.1418 This case was somewhat unique in that there was an overarching structure to the Prosecution’s case. The first ten False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges clearly represented the broad picture. However, the potential techniques which the accused persons could have adopted in executing false trading and price manipulation offences were not necessarily criminal, independent of the bigger picture. Here, the accused persons used some criminal techniques to carry out their Scheme. Thus, the charges brought served not only to punish them for their main transgressions, but also the manner in which they effected those transgressions. That the accused persons put their Scheme into effect using illegal means logically aggravates the Scheme as a whole, and, as stated, I took this into account in sentencing the accused persons for the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges.1419 However, given that the use of illegal mechanics had already aggravated the accused persons’ broad Scheme, I did not think that it could also be said that the Scheme aggravated the severity of the illegal mechanics by which the Scheme was put into effect. That, in my judgment, quite plainly amounted to double counting and I thus declined to take it into consideration for the purposes of the Cheating Charges.The appropriate sentence for each charge1420 With the aforementioned aggravating factors in mind, I considered the following sentences to be appropriate for the Cheating Charges:Charge NoCheating ChargesSentenceFirst AccusedSecond Accused 173FI – Goldman Sachs;Second Accused’s account;Amount cheated – S$69.36 million;8 years imprisonment7 years’ imprisonment174FI – Goldman Sachs;Mr Hong’s account;Amount cheated – S$73.23 million;8 years imprisonment6 years and 6 months’ imprisonment175FI – IB;Second Accused’s account;Amount cheated – S$200.73 million;9 years’ imprisonment8 years’ imprisonment176FI – IB;Mr Neo’s account;Amount cheated – S$232.16 million;9 years’ imprisonment7 years’ and 3 months’imprisonment177FI – IB;Mr Tan BK’s account;Amount cheated – S$117.68 million;8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment7 years’ imprisonment178FI – IB;Mr Chen’s account;Amount cheated – S$130.61 million;8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment7 years’ imprisonment1421 In arriving at the lengths of imprisonment terms, I chiefly distinguished between Cheating Charges based on the amount which the accused persons cheated. Where the amount cheated was between S$50 million and S$100 million, the starting point I applied was an imprisonment term of eight years. Where the amounts were between S$100 million and S$150 million, the starting point I adopted was eight years and six months’ imprisonment. And, finally, where the amounts went beyond S$150 million, the starting point I adopted was nine years.1422 In respect of the First Accused, I did not see any reason to either increase or decrease these starting points. As for the Second Accused, I took into consideration two matters in determining how far her sentences ought to be adjusted downwards relative to the First Accused. The first was the fact that she played a lesser role than the First Accused, who I found to have been actively involved in setting up the Second Accused’s Goldman Sachs account as well as sourcing for and obtaining BAL shares which were used as collateral in her account (see [595] above). However, the second consideration was that, despite the fact that the Second Accused played a lesser role, she nevertheless directly supplied two accounts which were used to cheat Goldman Sachs and IB of around S$269 million.1423 Taking into account these two considerations, I pegged the Second Accused’s culpability at four-fifths of the First Accused’s culpability in respect of Charges 174, 176, 177 and 178. As regards Charges 173 and 175 – which concerned the Second Accused’s own accounts with Goldman Sachs and IB – I pegged her culpability at a slightly higher level. In so far as the individual charges involving such large amounts cheated were concerned, this distinction, in my view, adequately reflected the lesser role she played specifically in relation to the Cheating Charges. On the whole, however, the Second Accused’s lower culpability was more appropriately recognised by considering which of the sentences ought to run consecutively, to which I will turn at [1443] below.The Company Management Charges1424 I now turn to the Company Management Charges. Under s 148(1) of the Companies Act, the First Accused was liable to be imprisoned for a term no longer than two years, a fine not exceeding S$10,000, or both.1425 In respect of these charges, the Prosecution submitted that there were three aggravating factors to be taken into consideration. First, the harm caused to shareholders of BAL as well as third parties who dealt with BAL.

 On the basis of these aggravating factors, the Prosecution urged me to sentence the First Accused to one year’s imprisonment for each charge.1426 The parties did not seriously dispute the factors which aggravated these charges given that, in any case, the Prosecution had not pressed for any of these charges to run consecutively. Nevertheless, for the same reasons I declined to take into account the purpose for which the cheated funds were used in relation to the Cheating Charges (see [1417]–[1419] above). In my view, it was, again, double counting for the court to take into account the first and second factors proposed by the Prosecution.1427 In chief, the key aggravating factors which I took into account were the long duration of offending as well as the fact that, while the First Accused was involved in the management of BAL, the degree of control he exercised was substantial. Bearing these two factors in mind, as well as the applicable sentencing principles for offences under s 148(1) of the Companies Act, as laid down in Yap Guat Beng, I was of the view that one year’s imprisonment on each of the three charges was appropriate.The Witness Tampering Charges1428 Lastly, I turn to the Witness Tampering Charges. In respect of Charges 182, 183, 184, 186 and 189, which were for completed offences, the First Accused could have been punished under s 204A of the Penal Code with a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, a fine, or both. As for the attempted offences, ie, Charges 185, 187 and 188, s 511 of the Penal Code provided that the First Accused could have been punished with up to half of the sentence prescribed by s 204A. That was, three years and six months, a fine, or both.Aggravating factors raised by the Prosecution1429 In respect of the completed offences, the Prosecution sought a flat sentence of three years’ imprisonment per charge. For the attempted offences, they sought half that sentence. To this end, the Prosecution submitted that I should take into account the following aggravating factors. First, the seriousness of the underlying offences.

 In respect of the first factor, he argued that to take into consideration the seriousness of the underlying offences would be to double count as he was already being punished for those offences separately. The First Accused also took issue with the second factor. He argued that it had not been proven that his witness tampering actually impeded the CAD and MAS’ joint investigation given that, in any event, Mr Gan, Mr Tai, Mr Chen and Mr Wong XY each ultimately incriminated the accused persons. As regards the third factor, the First Accused submitted that I had not made any finding that his witness tampering was premeditated. In respect of the fourth factor, the First Accused submitted that the court ought not take into account the instances of witness tampering in respect of which he had not been charged. Finally, as regards the fifth factor, the First Accused simply asserted that there was double counting without explanation.My decision in respect of the aggravating factors raised1431 Replying to the First Accused’s argument in respect of the first factor, the Prosecution submitted that the gravity of the offences underlying a charge brought under s 204A of the Penal Code logically informed the court’s assessment as to the severity of the s 204A offence. On this, the Prosecution said that the First Accused’s witness tampering:

… must be viewed as far more egregious than, for example, witness tampering in respect of a $100 theft offence, because the former (especially if it had resulted in an unjust acquittal of the underlying offence) results in greater distortion to the course of public justice and potentially allows the offender to avoid a greater punishment. 1432 In support of this argument, the Prosecution cited two decisions of the District Courts. First, Public Prosecutor v Lim Chit Foo [2019] SGDC 48 (“Lim Chit Foo”) and, second, Public Prosecutor v Yeo Jiawei [2017] SGDC 11 (“Yeo Jiawei”). In Lim Chit Foo, the district judge took into consideration “the seriousness of the acts of the [offender] in trying to thwart CAD investigations into the large-scale suspected fraudulent conduct” (at [121]). Similarly, in Yeo Jiawei, the district judge agreed that “there was a linkage between the seriousness of the underlying predicate offences and the efforts undertaken to stymie the investigations into them” (at [69]). In that case, the underlying offences involved cheating and illegal money laundering.1433 The Prosecution’s reference to these decisions of the lower courts was unnecessary. In Seah Hock Thiam, Choo J expressly stated that “in determining the extent of wrongdoing, the nature of the principal’s offence is relevant. The more serious it is, the more serious the act of perverting the course of justice will be in relation to it” (at [8]). Indeed, prior to the parties’ oral arguments on sentence being made in this case (that was, 4 November 2022), Seah Hock Thiam was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Parthiban a/l Kanapathy at [27(c)]. Thus, for this reason, I rejected the First Accused’s argument in respect of the first factor.1434 As regards the second factor, I did not accept the First Accused’s argument in respect of Charges 182, 183, 184, 186 and 189 which were for the completed witness tampering offences. That false statements were given to the CAD at all impeded investigations since steps needed to be taken to verify or correct such falsities. If the First Accused’s point was that his efforts were not particularly effective since the CAD managed to correct those falsities anyway, that was obviously not a point that went in his favour. If anything, that was a point in commendation of the CAD. 1435 In respect of the First Accused’s submission that I did not make specific findings that his commission of the witness tampering offences had been “premeditated”, I did not agree. On a proper reading of my oral judgment,

 it was clear that I found the First Accused’s witness tampering efforts to have been concerted. This was, in my view, a clear indication of premeditation and I took this into consideration as an aggravating factor accordingly. 1436 In respect of the fourth factor, I agreed with the First Accused that the various other instances of alleged witness tampering raised by the Prosecution ought not to be taken into account. Those were not in issue before me, and it was therefore inappropriate for them to be considered. Indeed, the Prosecution should not even have raised them in submissions.1437 Lastly, as regards the fifth factor, reference ought to be made to the decision of V K Rajah JA in Thong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor [2009] 3 SLR(R) 47 (“Thong Sing Hock”). There, it was held as follows (at [56]–[57]):56  It has been categorically established in [Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653] that genuine remorse and contrition is a valid mitigating factor. The converse is very often also true: lack of remorse is, in many cases, a relevant aggravating factor. While not articulated at length, the Singapore courts have recognised a lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. In Wan Kim Hock v PP [2003] 1 SLR(R) 410, Yong CJ noted at [30] that:Lastly, I noted that in mitigation, it could only be said of the appellant that he had no previous antecedents. This factor, while normally forceful, must be balanced against the numerous aggravating factors, such as the appellant’s failure to make restitution, his lack of remorse throughout the entire trial … [emphasis added]In other cases such as Siew Yit Beng v PP [2000] 2 SLR(R) 785 at [25] and Sarjit Singh s/o Mehar Singh v PP [2002] 2 SLR(R) 1040 at [16], the trial judges had explicitly considered “lack of remorse” as an aggravating factor. The subsequent appeal and petition for revision in each case were dismissed without comment on this issue, suggesting that the High Court had been of the view that the trial judges in both cases did not err in considering “lack of remorse” to be an aggravating factor. To my mind, taking into consideration a lack of remorse as an aggravating factor is entirely consistent with the four pillars of sentencing laid out in Chua Tiong Tiong v PP [2001] 2 SLR(R) 515, namely: retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence and prevention.57  The concept of retribution operates on the commonsensical notion that the punishment meted out to an offender should reflect the degree of harm and culpability that has been occasioned by such conduct. This is premised on the belief that “the societal interest is expressed in the recognition that typical crimes are wrongs, for which public censure through criminal sanction is due” (see Andrew Von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth, Proportionate Sentencing: Exploring the Principles (Oxford University Press, 2005) at p 4). As observed in [Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753] at [47], the inevitable corollary of the retribution principle is the proportionality principle that demands that offenders who commit more serious offences be punished more severely than those who commit less serious offences. According to Prof Andrew von Hirsch in his article “Deservedness and Dangerousness in Sentencing Policy” (1986) Crim L R 79–91 at 85, the seriousness of crime is a double-pronged fork, the first prong of which relates to the degree of harmfulness of the conduct. Applying this first prong, the degree of harmfulness of an unremorseful offender’s conduct is amplified because the violation of society’s norms and expectations persists through the offender’s refusal to take responsibility for his wrongdoing. Further, as explained in Andrew Ashworth, Sentencing and Criminal Justice (Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2005) at para 3.3.5, according to retributive theory, sentences communicate official censure or blame, the communication being chiefly to the offender but also to the victim and society at large. More severe censure will be warranted where there is a lack of remorse as there will be a greater need to communicate to the offender, the victim, and society at large that such conduct is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.[emphasis in original]1438 Given the clear legal position established by these cases that a lack of remorse can, in the right case, be taken into consideration as an aggravating factor, the question to be answered was whether there could be double counting in cases where such absence of contrition is raised in respect of distinct types of offences, over different periods of offending. In the present matter, although the Prosecution did not seriously press the argument that the First and/or Second Accused’s “lack of remorse” should be given serious consideration as an aggravating factor in respect of the False Trading, Price Manipulation, Deception and Cheating Charges, the First Accused was right in pointing out that they did in fact raise this factor in respect of all those charges

1439 In my judgment, the answer to the question stated in the preceding paragraph was that it depended entirely on how the lack of remorse was being taken into consideration as an aggravating factor. Consider for example, a case like the present – that is, one involving a large scheme and, in connection therewith, distinct types of offences being carried out across a long period of time. If, in a case like this, the accused person’s lack of remorse is formulated in very general terms, spanning the entire scheme and all connected offences, the answer is plainly that the lack of remorse can be double counted. However, where the lack of remorse is framed more precisely in respect of the various offences in issue, double counting may be avoided.1440 In cases like the present, where charges for offences under s 204A of the Penal Code were brought alongside charges for the predicate offences, such precision is not difficult to attain. Assuming that the accused person is convicted of both the predicate offences and the s 204A offences, the very fact that s 204A offences were committed at all can be taken as indicative of a lack of remorse for the predicate offences. A person who is genuinely contrite simply would not have sought to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice. However, the accused could additionally show a lack of remorse for the s 204A offences themselves. For example, in cases where the s 204A charges are vehemently denied despite the evidence ultimately demonstrating that the accused person’s efforts at perverting the course of justice were sustained, persistent and premeditated (see, eg, Lim Chit Foo at [122] and Parthiban a/l Kanapathy at [27(c)]).1441 Such a description applied to the present case and I therefore took into consideration the First Accused’s lack of contrition as an aggravating factor. I should add, however, that notwithstanding my clarification above, there was arguably no double counting in the present case. The Prosecution did not seriously urge the court to take into consideration the accused persons’ “lack of remorse” where the Conspiracy Charges were concerned. Given the litany of other aggravating factors which were applicable to those offences, this was unsurprising. That said, had the Prosecution insisted that I take into consideration the accused persons’ lack of remorse in sentencing them for the Conspiracy Charges, I would nevertheless have held that the lack of remorse demonstrated by the First Accused in respect of those offences was distinct from that which he exhibited in respect of the Witness Tampering Charges. I would therefore have found that there was no double counting in any event. The appropriate sentence for each charge1442 Upon consideration of the relevant aggravating factors set out above, as well as the Court of Appeal’s recent affirmation that general deterrence ought to be the primary sentencing consideration in respect of offences under s 204A of the Penal Code (see Parthiban a/l Kanapathy at [27(a)]), I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in respect of each of the completed Witness Tampering Charges was three years’ imprisonment. As regards the charges relating to the First Accused’s attempts, I determined that the appropriate sentence for each charge was one year and six months’ imprisonment.Aggregate sentences imposed on the accused persons1443 Pursuant to s 307(1) of the CPC, at least two of the sentences imposed on the accused persons must be ordered to run consecutively. In determining which of the sentences ought to run consecutively, the court must have regard to principles including the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor [2014] 2 SLR 998 at [81]–[82]).1444 In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the False Trading and Price Manipulation, Deception and Cheating Charges each engaged different and distinct legally protected interests. Given the multiplicity of charges within each category, I found that a representative set of sentences across the three categories should be made to run consecutively to reflect the overall culpability of the accused persons.1445 For the False Trading and Price Manipulation charges, it was important to emphasise that the overall Scheme concerned the shares of three separate companies. Hence, I determined that the sentences for one False Trading Charge each in relation to Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold ought to be made to run consecutively. In respect of the First Accused, it was appropriate for the sentences for Charges 2, 5 and 9 to run consecutively. As regards the Second Accused, it was appropriate for the sentences for Charges 2, 4 and 9 to run consecutively. The selection of the sentence for Charge 4 for the Second Accused served to reflect her lesser involvement with the execution of the Scheme in relation to Asiasons shares. The other seven charges were ordered to run concurrently for both accused persons.1446 As for the Deception Charges, as I mentioned at [1402] above, these charges focused on the mechanics of the Scheme. Despite the number of charges, it was sufficient for the sentence for just one charge to run consecutively. For both accused persons, I was of the view that the sentence for charge 13 should run consecutively. I ordered that the sentences for the remaining 152 Deception Charges were to run concurrently.1447 I turn to the Cheating Charges. In relation to the First Accused, it was appropriate for the sentences for two of the six Cheating Charges to run consecutively, ie, one in respect of each FI cheated. I ordered that these were to be the sentences for Charges 174 and 175. Given the Second Accused’s lesser role in relation to the Cheating Charges, it was appropriate for the sentence of only one of the six charges to run consecutively and I ordered that to be the sentence for Charge 175 which involved the Second Accused’s own IB account. The remaining charges were ordered to run concurrently for both accused persons.1448 In relation to the Company Management Charges against the First Accused, I agreed with the parties that the sentences for all three charges ought to run concurrently with the rest of the First Accused’s sentences.1449 As for the Witness Tampering Charges against the First Accused, given that there were eight charges involving four witnesses, I was of the view that two of those sentences should be made to run consecutively. In this regard, the sentences for Charges 183 and 186 (which involved Mr Gan and Mr Tai respectively, and, which were, in my view, the more serious of the eight charges), should run consecutively and the sentences for the remaining Witness Tampering Charges were ordered to run concurrently.1450 I turn to the calculation of the aggregate sentences imposed on the accused persons as well as any overall adjustments which needed to be made pursuant to the totality principle.The First Accused’s aggregate sentence1451 As regards the First Accused, it was my view that the eight sentences for Charges 2, 5, 9, 13, 174, 175, 183 and 186 should run consecutively. The First Accused’s aggregate sentence, prior to making any adjustments, was thus 42 years’ imprisonment.1452 In my view, this global sentence warranted adjustments pursuant to the totality principle, to ensure that the global sentence was proportionate to the overall criminality but was not “crushing” on the First Accused who was, as at the date of my judgment on sentence, 62-years old. I therefore adjusted downwards by one year, each of the three False Trading and the two Cheating Charges, ie, Charges 2, 5, 9, 174 and 175. I also adjusted downwards by six months each of the two Witness Tampering Charges, ie, Charges 183 and 186. The sentences, following adjustments, I imposed were as follows: Charge NoChargeSentence2False Trading;Blumont;5 years’ imprisonment5False Trading;Asiasons;5 years’ imprisonment9False Trading;LionGold;5 years’ imprisonment13Deception;AmFraser account of Mr Chen;1 August 2012 to 3 October 20131 year’s imprisonment174Cheating;FI – Goldman Sachs, Mr Hong’s account;Amount cheated – S$73.23 million.7 years’ imprisonment175Cheating;FI – IB, Second Accused’s account;Amount cheated – S$200.73 million.8 years’ imprisonment183Witness Tampering;Mr Gan;Between 1 and 31 December 2015.2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment186Witness Tampering;Mr Tai;Between 1 and 31 December 2013.2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment1453 The First Accused’s aggregate sentence, following these adjustments, was 36 years’ imprisonment. I did not make equivalent adjustments to the sentences which I ordered to run concurrently. That was, the sentences for (a) the remaining seven False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, (b) the remaining 152 Deception Charges, (c) the remaining four Cheating Charges, (d) the three Company Management Charges, and (e) the remaining six Witness Tampering Charges. In respect of these 172 charges, the sentences imposed on the First Accused were simply those set out at [1388], [1408], [1420], [1427] and [1442] above. The Second Accused’s aggregate sentence1454 Next, in relation to the Second Accused, it was my view that the five sentences for Charges 2, 4, 9, 13 and 175, ought to run consecutively. The Second Accused’s aggregate sentence, therefore, was 20 years. I found this sentence appropriate on the whole and did not make any further adjustments. Specifically, the sentences for these charges were:Charge NoChargeSentence2False Trading;Blumont;4 years’ imprisonment4False Trading;Asiasons;3 years’ imprisonment9False Trading;LionGold;4 years’ imprisonment13Deception;AmFraser account of Mr Chen;1 August 2012 to 3 October 20131 years’ imprisonment175Cheating;FI – IB, Second Accused’s account;Amount cheated – S$200.73 million.8 years’ imprisonment1455 As for the remaining charges of which the Second Accused had been convicted, I imposed on her the sentences as set out at [1388], [1408], and [1420] above. Commencement of the accused persons’ sentences1456 The First Accused has been in remand since 25 November 2016.

 Having considered the circumstances of this case (especially the short period she spent in remand), I declined to make any further adjustments in relation to the Second Accused’s global term of imprisonment of 20 years. I therefore ordered that the Second Accused’s sentence commence on the date I handed down my judgment, 28 December 2022.1457 However, I should add that after I imposed the foregoing sentences on the accused persons on 28 December 2022, they applied under s 383 of the CPC for the execution of their sentences to be stayed pending their appeals. The First Accused, who was in remand, did not however apply for bail pending his appeal. Mr Sreenivasan explained that the stay, if granted, would simply serve the purpose of allowing the First Accused to remain in remand rather than being transferred to prison. As the necessary administrative and logistical arrangements have already been put in place by the Singapore Prisons Service for the First Accused to work on his case while in remand, the stay would facilitate further preparations for his appeal.

 As regards the Second Accused, she was on bail and, accordingly, she additionally applied for bail pending her appeal under s 382 of the CPC.1458 The Prosecution did not object to the applications. Accordingly, I stayed the execution of both the First Accused and Second Accused’s sentences. In respect of the Second Accused, I also extended her bail pending appeal. In this connection, both Mr Sreenivasan and Mr Eugene Thuraisingam gave their undertakings that they would file their respective clients’ appeals by 28 December 2022, which they duly did.1459 In so far as the Second Accused’s application was concerned, there was nothing of controversy. However, as the First Accused’s 36-year sentence had been backdated to the date of his remand, 25 November 2016, a question arose as to whether s 383 of the CPC conferred on the court the power to, in the same stroke, both backdate a sentence and stay the execution of that sentence pending appeal. These concurrent orders initially seemed slightly incompatible, but this was more apparent than real. Conceptually, my order that the First Accused’s sentence be backdated simply recognised that his 36-year sentence had already commenced. This being the case, the issue which remained was whether the court could stay the execution of a sentence already commenced. In this regard, the parties pointed me to Bander Yahya A Alzahrani v Public Prosecutor [2018] 3 SLR 925 at [18]–[23], in which Steven Chong JA squarely answered this question in the positive, albeit in the context of a stay application made pending an application for leave to bring a criminal reference. There was thus no issue with granting the First Accused a stay in the circumstances.Addressing the allegations of Prosecutorial misconduct1460 Before concluding, I must return to the accused persons’ allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and case mismanagement (see [155] above). Although I remarked at the very outset of these grounds that the accused persons did not, even in the slightest, express any remorse for their actions, as these grounds have shown, “lack of remorse” was not a factor which bore substantially on my sentencing decision. Accordingly, although the fact of the allegations I am about to address could have been taken as an aggravating factor in that sense, I did not construe them as such. It is thus more appropriate to deal with the allegations wholly separately from my substantive decision. As I also stated at [155], the extent and nature of the allegations made by the First and Second Accused differed substantially.Allegations made by the First Accused1461 I begin with those made on the part of the First Accused. During the trial, there were points at which counsel for the First Accused, Mr Sreenivasan, suggested that the case which had been advanced by the Prosecution was blinkered by their unyielding belief in the accused persons’ guilt, as well as their desire to pin the blame on them. On this footing, it was said that, even as evidence was brought to light – both in the course of the investigations and during the trial – the Prosecution ignored the real possibility that such evidence might suggest that they could have commenced this action against the wrong individuals. Instead, the Prosecution’s case took on an evolving quality.

 That was, it evolved to accommodate the new evidence and, thus, gradually crept into the realm of illogicality. This, in turn, left the Defence with a case that was impossible to answer.1462 To the extent that this suggestion was made substantively to analytically criticise the Prosecution’s case theory, and the extent to which such case theory was supported by the evidence adduced at trial, there were no issues. A defence is fully entitled to take a dim view of the Prosecution’s case, particularly in highly complex matters like this, if it is able to support that view with critical analysis of the issues and evidence placed before the court. 1463 In this matter, however, there were points at which the First Accused’s critique went beyond criticisms of the Prosecution’s substantive case, and veered into attacks on the Prosecution’s integrity and the way in which they were conducting themselves. Indeed, in my view, even the criticisms of the Prosecution’s case, made largely through Mr Sreenivasan, could have been made with less intemperate rhetoric. One example was the needless characterisation of the Prosecution’s case as well as the investigation as “blinkered” and “myopic”.

 It should have been sufficient to deal with the case and evidence in substance without such language. 1464 Another example of the First Accused’s case critique as “intemperate” is typified by a statement Mr Sreenivasan made while cross-examining Ms Sheryl Tan on the status of investigations against the other actors in this matter who seemed to have been involved in potential criminal activity. In essence, Mr Sreenivasan wished for Ms Tan to comment on whether there was sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against other persons involved in this matter, and, more specifically, against those who had given evidence for the Prosecution against the accused persons.

John Soh will go on the witness stand and … say what he did. But what certain other people have been doing to cover themselves is a different ball game. And … this is not a shot in the dark. This has been established painstakingly. What do they have to hide with this one question, that some of the people who they put on the stand should have been in the dock.[emphasis added]1465 Statements such as these are hardly ever necessary. In all disputes, civil or criminal, and whether routine or complex, far more stands to be gained – in particular, by counsel – from approaching heated points of contention with tact and composure. Indeed, this is best illustrated by the fact that the main point to be made about the credibility of the witnesses could be made effectively, and was made in the First Accused’s own written submissions, without reliance on such intemperate language.

 Apart from overdone criticisms of the Prosecution’s case, I mentioned also that the First Accused had veered into the realm of casting aspersions on the Prosecution’s integrity and conduct. In this regard, the Prosecution took particular exception to the following statements made at various points in the First Accused’s written closing:

(c) Third, that the Prosecution “knowingly” avoided taking a “firm position” in respect of Mr Gwee’s involvement at an earlier stage of the trial in order to “suppress avenues of inquiry favourable to the Defence”. Furthermore, by “not recording” Mr Gwee’s subsequent statements (see [1511]–[1517] below) in the ordinary way – that was, through the CAD – the Prosecution had placed those statements (couched as representations to the Prosecution) under the “cloak” of privilege, thus “adeptly and adroitly” sidestepping its obligations under Muhammad bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“Kadar (No 1)”) and Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor [2011] 4 SLR 791 (“Kadar (No 2)”) (collectively, “Kadar”).

1466 In my view, the first statement was not particularly problematic. While it was certainly not measured, the use of the word “appeared” made clear that it was not an allegation against the Prosecution as much as a statement as to what the First Accused perceived was the Prosecution’s intention. Where the cause of the Crash was concerned, this distinction was important. As mentioned at [1302] above, I was somewhat disappointed with the Prosecution’s decision not to call Mr Kelvin Koh as the witness for the SGX. As the decision was not explained, I could understand the First Accused’s use of the words “studiously ignored”. Although I firmly disagreed with the suggestion that the Prosecution had “studiously ignored” the SGX’s role in triggering the Crash, in the circumstances, I did not read into the use of those words an intention to attack the Prosecution’s conduct. Rather, in light of the way in which the SGX’s evidence was given, I preferred to view it simply as a somewhat melodramatic way of articulating the neutral point that the Prosecution had “failed to consider” the SGX’s role. 1467 The second and third allegations, however, were plainly improper and I take this opportunity to dismiss them as unmeritorious. (a) As to the former, the Prosecution had – on multiple occasions

 – confirmed their position that it had not closed its position in respect of potential criminal proceedings against other actors in this matter. Even if this appeared to be unlikely given the years which have passed since the Relevant Period, there was no basis to suggest that the Prosecution had given anyone “get out of jail free cards”. Indeed, even for Mr Gwee – arguably the most significant character in respect of which the issue of plea bargaining had arisen – both Mr Gwee

 Indeed, they stated unequivocally that their concern with disclosing the statements attached to Mr Gwee’s representations, was not how such statements could have borne on this case. Instead, it was the broader concern that disclosure might undermine the “substantial public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of representations sent to the Prosecution”.

 Given that these statements were made by counsel to the court, I took them as true, and, in fact, without more, Mr Sreenivasan should have known to do so as well. 1468 Ultimately, however, I do not intend to make more of these allegations than to dismiss them as unmeritorious. This was a uniquely complex and challenging matter to handle on all fronts. That professional lines were toed – and, on certain occasions, crossed – could be charitably understood in that context. Indeed, there is something to be said for the fact that they probably should be. In his oral closing, Mr Sreenivasan stated:

Your Honour, before I go into my reply submissions, I’d first like to express my thanks to my learned friends, the deputies. There have been lots of disagreement but they have never been disagreeable, and within the constraints of policy and the instructions, I would like to acknowledge that they have been as helpful as they can be. A 200-day trial, it’s been made a lot more tolerable because of that.I therefore leave it to the Prosecution to decide what to make of my findings, if anything at all, and to Mr Sreenivasan to decide whether it is necessary or appropriate to withdraw his suggestions in light of my analysis as set out above. Allegations made by the Second Accused1469 I turn to the Second Accused’s allegations, which went far beyond those of the First Accused, into the realm of serious, express allegations of systematic and deliberate prosecutorial misconduct. Beyond the suggestion that the Prosecution’s case was “blinkered”

 – which was, in context, the most tempered of the assertions she made – the Second Accused made four specific and serious allegations in her written closing. 1470 For the avoidance of any doubt, I should state clearly that these submissions were prepared after her first set of lawyers, Harry Elias Partnership, had discharged themselves, but before her second set of lawyers, Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, took on representation at the sentencing stage of this matter. That said, I should state for completeness and accuracy that similar allegations had been made in connection with the accused persons’ application to stay these criminal proceedings (ie, the application I dealt with in PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 2)).

 Thus, to the extent that anyone could be said to be responsible for the four serious allegations I am about to set out, it was solely the Second Accused. 1471 These allegations appeared in the Second Accused’s written closing submissions under the general heading, “Prosecutorial Misconduct”,

 and were as follows: (a) first, that the Prosecution knowingly failed to disclose exculpatory material evidence; (b) second, that the Prosecution engaged in witness coaching; (c) third, that the Prosecution improperly exercised its discretion in order to induce witnesses to provide evidence favourable to their position; and (d) fourth, that the Prosecution purposely avoided calling material witnesses to give evidence at the trial. Drawing these allegations together, the Second Accused then went on to submit that the proceedings were “irreparably tainted”, referring to the need for justice not only to be done but be seen to be done (for this, the Second Accused cited Gobi a/l Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 883 at [93]). Even if there existed innocent explanations for the Prosecution’s actions, she said, it was not conceivable that justice could be said to be seen in the case against her.

Kadar obligations have to be complied with before the trial such that the defence may develop a defence strategy taking into account the relevant objective evidence available. In breach of these obligations, the Prosecution failed to disclose the [Phillip Securities] landline recordings in their possession, which contained instructions from account holders to [Mr] Tjoa. Instead, at the commencement of the trial in March 2019, the Prosecution skilfully selected and disclosed 102 land line recordings from [AmFraser] with full transcripts in order to show that [the First Accused] had direct communications with [Mr] Kam. The Prosecution then followed this up with the unequivocal confirmation to this Honourable Court that all “Kadar-able” recordings had been disclosed. This confirmation was made by the Prosecution within the context of their full knowledge and awareness of the relevance and materiality of all landline recordings relating to the TRs.1473 I do not propose to deal with this allegation in any detail as it pertains to an issue raised and addressed in PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 2). As explained in the fourth appendix to these grounds, that decision concerned the Defence’s application made in 2020 to permanently stay these proceedings. One of the bases on which that application stood was the Prosecution’s alleged failure to discharge its Kadar obligations, particularly, in relation to the landline recordings of various TRs, including Mr Tjoa. I rejected the argument she had made then (see PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 2) at [73]–[78]) and her argument as set out above was simply a rehash of the issue.1474 The second allegation was as follows:

Another form of misconduct that has been rampant in this case is how Prosecution witnesses have been coached by the investigative officers having conduct of this case. This witness coaching has taken two forms:(a) the use of incomplete and tailored evidence in order to mislead and/or induce prosecution witnesses into providing statements that align with the Prosecution’s preconceived conclusions; and(b) the use of pre-prepared witness statements to coach witnesses into signing statements that contain words, allegations, and innuendo that were never originally said or intended by the witnesses.1475 To illustrate her allegation that the Prosecution had used “incomplete evidence” to mislead witnesses, the Second Accused stated:

The most egregious and damning example of the Prosecution’s use of incomplete evidence to mislead a prosecution witness has been dealt with above in the case of the prosecution withholding the [Phillip Securities] landline recordings in order to mislead [Mr] Tjoa into confirming that none of the Account Holders had ever given him instructions in respect of the [Relevant Accounts]. When presented with the withheld landline recordings during trial, [Mr] Tjoa not only recanted from his position, he admitted that he had direct communications with various Account Holders who he did give him instructions. But perhaps more critically for present purposes, he confirmed that his evidence in his [conditioned statement] would have been different if he had been shown phone records when his statement was being taken.[The Second Accused then set out the following:]

Question (Mr Fong): If you had been shown these phone records, you might have written your conditioned statement differently?Answer (Mr Tjoa): Well, if I have been shown th[ese] records, then I would know that when is the time they stopped giving instructions. Because I -- all the answers I provide in the statement is actually based on my memory, and all this also happened quite long time ago, so I honestly it’s -- I cannot give an accurate answer.1476 In my view, the Second Accused’s submission fundamentally misunderstood what it meant to mislead a witness. As a starting point, Mr Tjoa testified to his recollection that the accused persons chiefly contacted him on his mobile phone and, additionally, that the Second Accused rarely reached him on his office landline.

 Mr Tjoa also stated that, in respect of the Relevant Accounts belonging to Mr Goh HC, Mr Hong, Mr Sugiarto, G1 Investments, and ITE Assets, he was not entirely sure of the point at which the Second Accused began giving trading instructions. Mr Tjoa also mentioned that there was a point when he stopped receiving instructions from these accountholders entirely, though he was unable to state exactly when that was.

 1477 Mr Fong’s cross-examination of Mr Tjoa, as reproduced by the Second Accused perhaps shed light on the gaps in Mr Tjoa’s recollection. However, it certainly did not demonstrate that Mr Tjoa was misled by the Prosecution into giving the evidence he did. To bear out that claim, the Second Accused would have needed to establish first, that the landline recordings fundamentally falsified Mr Tjoa’s position; second, that the Prosecution was aware that the landline records would falsify Mr Tjoa’s position; and finally, that it then took steps to suppress those recordings to preserve Mr Tjoa’s position as that was favourable to the Prosecution’s case. None of these were made out.1478 First of all, the landlines simply did not falsify the thrust of Mr Tjoa’s evidence. At the very highest, it could be said to have filled in gaps or specific mistakes in his recollection. This did not affect the most important aspect of his testimony that it was the accused persons who gave trading instructions in respect of the Relevant Accounts under his management.

 1479 The second and third points were also plainly not made out. The Prosecution explained that – in light of Mr Tjoa’s evidence – the investigators did not think it necessary to review the Phillip Securities landline recordings. This was a reasonable view to take, and there is no basis for me to suggest otherwise on the facts. Indeed, to do so would be entirely contradictory to the Court of Appeal’s statement in Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor and another matter [2022] 1 SLR 535 that it would be “inappropriate for the court to impose a legal duty on the Prosecution or law enforcement agencies to conduct further investigations, given that it is not our role to direct the exercise of the Executive’s functions” (at [166]). Without any grounds to believe that the Prosecution was even apprised of the specific contents of the Phillip Securities landline recordings, much less that they were aware of those contents and applied their knowledge to the nefarious end of misleading Mr Tjoa, there was simply nothing on which the Second Accused’s contention could stand.1480 The Second Accused also raised examples which she claimed demonstrated that the Prosecution had misled other witnesses – specifically, Mr Jordan Chew and Mr Alex Chew – by using tailored evidence.

 This submission did not merit serious consideration. As the Prosecution put it, “there is nothing untoward about filtering data to … relevant portions [of a spreadsheet] and asking [a] witness” to give their evidence on such data. This was “akin to flipping to particular pages within a 100-page document and asking [that] witness to comment [on those relevant pages]”.

 In cases as voluminous as this, this was patently logical. Unless it could be said that there was something specific about the manner in which the filtered data was presented that materially warped Mr Jordan Chew and Mr Alex Chew’s evidence, an assertion which was itself contingent on them being so easily malleable, there was nothing which could be made of the Second Accused’s contention.1481 As regards the third sub-allegation made by the Second Accused, that the Prosecution used “pre-prepared witness statements”, I dismiss this roundly.

 namely, Mr Andy Lee, Mr Jack Ng, Mr Gan, and Mr Thurnham, appeared before me on the stand and attested to the truth of their respective conditioned statements, which had been signed. There was nothing to suggest that the statements they had put into evidence were not their own.1482 That said, I am mindful that there were certain witnesses who admitted that their conditioned statements had been drafted for them. For example, Mr Thurnham stated that two subparagraphs of his conditioned statement had been drafted for him, and that he did not know who had done so.

It is no secret that investigation officers and prosecutors are involved in the preparation and drafting of witnesses’ conditioned statements. What is crucial is that the witnesses are given full opportunity to review and make amendments to the conditioned statement, and they sign on these conditioned statements accepting that it is their evidence. …1483 The courts are well aware of the practices adopted in the drafting of affidavits and, here, conditioned statements. Although one fully understands the practical realities that necessitate such a practice, a witness’s statement should, as a premise, be that witness’s statement. It should ideally be written by them personally, but, at the very least, as the Prosecution suggests, it is crucial for witnesses to have full opportunity to review and make amendments to draft statements, and to confirm the contents before finalising the statements. That being said, as there was no real basis in this case to impugn the preparation of the witness statements to which the Second Accused pointed, I rejected her allegations.1484 The third allegation was as follows:

In a similar vein as the above issue of witness coaching but more invidious is the Prosecution’s misuse of their prosecutorial discretion to secure favourable evidence from the witnesses. Several Prosecution Witnesses have admitted to (i) perjury; (ii) changing witness statements; (iii) front running; (iv) cheating; and (v) market manipulation for personal profit and gain, and none of these individuals have faced any charges.It cannot be an everyday occurrence that Prosecution Witnesses take the stand and confess, under oath, to committing a slew of offences. Yet, this is precisely what the Prosecution witnesses in this present case have done. The only logical conclusion to this state of affairs is that the Prosecution has either explicitly or implicitly, given assurances of immunity to the prosecution witnesses in order to induce them into giving false testimony favourable to the Prosecution’s case.1485 I have already dealt with the essence of this allegation at [1467(a)] above in connection with the First Accused’s position. Thus, I will simply state that those points apply equally here. 1486 The fourth and final allegation raised by the Second Accused was that the Prosecution failed to call the various TRs and Relevant Accountholders who were said to be “material witnesses”. This list included, for example, Ms Ang, Mr Aaron Ong, Ms Jenny Lim, Mr Kuan AM, Mr Menon, Ms Ng SL, Mr Neo, Mr Billy Ooi, Mr Fernandez, Mr Lim KY, Mr Lee CH and Dato Wira.

 This argument misunderstood the Prosecution’s obligation in respect of material witnesses (assuming each of the witnesses listed were even material) set out in Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor [2020] 1 SLR 984 (“Nabill”). As the Court of Appeal recently restated in Kong Swee Eng v Public Prosecutor [2022] 2 SLR 1374 at [25]:… this court has made clear in Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor [2020] 1 SLR 984 at [67] and [71] and Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor and another matter [2022] 1 SLR 535 at [126]–[128] that the Prosecution does not have the obligation to call any particular witness, material or otherwise. When the Prosecution chooses not to call a material witness, it has to bear the risk that its evidence might not satisfy its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This risk is most apparent in cases where the accused person advances a credible defence and is able to discharge his evidential burden of proof. …1487 The Prosecution was free to take the risk it did in deciding that the majority of the Relevant Accountholders did not need to be called as Prosecution witnesses. There can therefore be no suggestion of prosecutorial misconduct on the grounds that the Prosecution failed, in this case, to call the witnesses listed by the Second Accused. Indeed, just as the Prosecution could choose to call the witnesses it saw fit, so too could the Second Accused. In her written closing, it was submitted that the “best way to [have] resolve[d] the question of whether the [Relevant Accountholders] gave instructions in respect of their own accounts was, unsurprisingly, simply to ask the accountholders themselves”.

 Yet, not only did the Second Accused elect to remain silent, she also opted not to call any witnesses to her defence. This was her decision, and, having taken it, it cannot be said that she had not been given the full opportunity to establish her defence, if not through her own evidence, at least through the evidence of witnesses who supposedly would support her general case. 1488 As the Second Accused did not make her unmeritorious allegations of prosecutorial misconduct through counsel, there is little more that needs to be said about the fact that they were made at all. The Second Accused may, if she wishes, withdraw her allegations in light of my analysis, but, as I have stated at [1460] above, that such allegations were made did not bear on my decision on sentence given the substantial number of other aggravating factors. Nevertheless, it is still important for me to state firmly and clearly that allegations such as those made by the Second Accused should not be made lightly. Unless they rest upon solid foundations, they tend to achieve little more than distraction from the substantive issues. They can even cast doubt on the fair administration of justice, and, although it did not affect my decision on sentence in this case, it could have. As stated in Thong Sing Hock, a lack of remorse is a factor which may aggravate the severity of offences. Few things indicate a lack of remorse like an accused-in-person’s willingness to advance patently unmeritorious allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Conclusion1489 For the reasons given throughout these grounds and summarised at [1289]–[1295] above, I convicted both accused persons of ten charges for conspiring to commit false trading and market rigging offences in violation of s 197(1)(b) of the SFA, 153 charges for conspiring to commit deception offences contrary to s 201(b) of the SFA, and six charges for conspiring to cheat in violation of s 420 of the Penal Code. For each one of these 169 conspiracy offences, I found that the underlying offences had been carried out, and, as such, the accused persons were liable to be sentenced under s 109 of the Penal Code. I also convicted the First Accused of a further 11 charges that had only been brought against him. These were three charges for being involved in the management of Blumont, Asiasons, and LionGold while being an undischarged bankrupt in violation of s 148(1) of the Companies Act, five charges for perverting the course of justice contrary to s 204A of the Penal Code, and three charges for attempting to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 204A read with s 511 of the Penal Code.1490 For their commission of these offences, I imposed on the First Accused a global sentence of 36 years’ imprisonment. This term represented the aggregate of the sentences imposed for three False Trading Charges, one Deception Charge, two Cheating Charges, and two Witness Tampering Charges, with downward adjustments made on the basis of the totality principle. As regards the Second Accused, I imposed a global sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. This represented the aggregate of sentences I imposed on her for three False Trading Charges, one Deception Charge, and one Cheating Charge. No adjustments were made to the Second Accused’s global sentence.1491 In closing, it should be reemphasised that the accused persons perpetrated a scheme of substantial scale, complexity and sophistication. Armed with a good understanding of the securities and financial markets, and tapping on their extensive connections and networks, they boldly exploited the system. They personally minded and tended – on an almost daily basis – to the intricate system they devised for a prolonged period of 14 months, taking steps to evade detection by the authorities along the way. The facts show that they did not put the Scheme into operation by themselves, and one may wonder about the legal propriety of the actions of certain other characters which featured in this enormous case. Indeed, the accused persons sought to place this line of thinking at the heart of their defence. Nevertheless, irrespective of the potential liability of such other characters, the salient point is that I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt – both at a general level, and at the granular level of the individual charges brought – that, although the accused persons were not the only persons who put the Scheme into motion, they did so at the helm. Their goal was to make financial gains, regardless of whether they ultimately ended up in a net positive position, and, in pursuit of this objective, they brought about the Crash as well as the immense harm which followed therefrom. Even after the Scheme failed, the First Accused continued to subvert justice by concealing what had been done, and neither accused person showed any remorse for the consequences they had brought about.1492 This brings me back to the Prosecution’s statement I quoted at the very outset of these grounds – that this matter represents the “most serious case of stock market manipulation in Singapore”.

 – are not of great assistance. Factors such as their relative impact on market sentiment, the financial strain placed on individual retail investors (quite apart from their loss in dollar-figures), and other intangibles and less obvious tangibles, are not readily comparable. However, that is not important where the court and criminal sanctions are concerned. What is more important, and which can be said with certainty is that this matter represents an exceptionally serious case of stock market manipulation in Singapore for all the reasons that I have given. Thus, having convicted both accused persons of almost every charge which had been brought against them, it was necessary and, indeed, of utmost importance, that the global sentences imposed on them be sufficiently substantial not only to capture the gravity of their wrongdoing, but also to deter those who might be tempted to act as they have.1493 It remains for me to thank the Prosecution and Defence for the immense volume of work they have put into this matter. At just about 200 days of hearing, the trial of this matter was long, and the factual density of the case, as well as its overall complexity, certainly stood to match. I am therefore grateful to counsel not only for their effort and industry, but also for their consistency and stamina. Mr Teo Guan Siew, Mr Jiang Ke-Yue, Mr Nicholas Tan, Ms Ng Jean Ting and Mr David Koh appeared for the Prosecution, as did then-Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair SC, Mr Peter Koy, Mr Randeep Singh, Mr Tan Ben Mathias, Ms Loh Hui Min, and Ms Esther Wong at earlier stages of these proceedings. Mr Narayanan Sreenivasan SC, Mr Lim Wei Liang Jason and Ms Kamini Devadass of K&L Gates Straits Law LLC represented the First Accused, and, at earlier stages, there was also Ms Victoria Tan Zhen Wei and, more briefly, Mr Selvarajan Balamurugan. Until the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Second Accused was represented by Mr Philip Fong and Mr Sui Yi Siong of Harry Elias Partnership LLP. At various points, they were assisted by Ms Jaime Lau Jia Min and Mr Brian Ho Rui Lin. At the sentencing stage of these proceedings, representation of the Second Accused was taken over by Mr Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Mr Suang Wijaya and Ms Ng Clare Sophia of Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.Hoo Sheau PengJudge of the High CourtTeo Guan Siew, Jiang Ke-Yue, Nicholas Tan, Ng Jean Ting and David Koh (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;Narayanan Sreenivasan SC, Lim Wei Liang Jason and Kamini Devadass (K&L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the first accused;Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and Ng Clare Sophia (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the second accused.Appendices1494 As stated at [10] above, there are five appendices to these grounds.

It should be noted that these two Worksheets are connected. In the False Trading and Price Manipulation Charges, the Prosecution alleged that the accused persons’ conspiracies “involved controlling trading accounts (set out in the enclosed Annex A)”. Annex A was a list of the 189 Relevant Accounts,

 and all 189 accounts have been captured in Worksheet 2 alongside other useful information such as each account’s type (cash or margin), the account’s opening date, its CDP account number as well as references to its CDP account share movement records, the names of authorised signatories (for corporate accounts), the names of persons holding LPOAs, and the appointed TR.(b) The third Worksheet (“Worksheet 3”) contains a schedule of the 161 Deception Charges placed alongside an index of the 161 of 189 Relevant Accounts which formed the subject of those charges (it should be noted that this excludes Charge 153, of which the accused persons were acquitted upon their submission of no case to answer: see [1518]–[1519] below). Worksheet 3 also captures the Prosecution’s case in respect of how the accused persons were allegedly involved in instructing orders and trades in each of those accounts. As I have explained at [951]–[953] above, such allegations were originally contained in a document titled “Annex B – Information relating to 11th to 172nd charges under section 201 SFA” (marked exhibit C-B). Those allegations were revised during the Prosecution’s cross-examination of the First Accused.

 The Worksheet 3 captures the Prosecution’s revised allegations, but, where changes were made, those changes have been highlighted with different coloured text.(c) The fourth Worksheet (“Worksheet 4”) is an index of the Relevant Accounts which did not form the subject of Deception Charges. These accounts are captured in a separate index as they were primarily those belonging to the Second Accused or, accounts in respect of which she had formal authority to give trading instructions. As the nature of “control” exercised over these accounts was unlike that exercised over the other Relevant Accounts, in respect of which neither accused person was properly authorised to give trading instructions, it was useful for these accounts to be easily gathered as a group. Worksheet 4 also captures the Prosecution’s case as regards how the accused persons allegedly used these accounts to place BAL trades. However, it should be noted that the Prosecution’s case where these accounts were concerned, was only contained in exhibit C-B1, and was not set out in exhibit C-B. Thus, unlike in Worksheet 3, there are not changes which needed to be highlighted with different coloured text.(d) The fifth Worksheet (“Worksheet 5”) is a schedule of the Cheating Charges placed alongside relevant details of the accounts to which those charges pertained. That is, the Goldman Sachs accounts of the Second Accused and Mr Hong, and the IB accounts of the Second Accused, Mr Neo, Mr Tan BK, and Mr Chen. This minimises the need for cross-referencing.(e) The last Worksheet (“Worksheet 6”) is a schedule of the remaining charges brought only against the First Accused. That was, the three Company Management and eight Witness Tampering Charges. 1496 This Excel Workbook may be accessed as an attachment to the PDF copy of these grounds of decision. The Excel file is titled “Appendix 1 – Index of Relevant Accounts and Charges”.Appendix 2: Glossary of Persons 1497 The second appendix is a table titled “Glossary of Persons”. This table lists the individuals and corporations which featured in this case. 1498 The table comprises three columns. The first states the serial number of each row which have been referenced in footnotes throughout these grounds of decision. The second column states the name of the individual or corporation as used – in an abbreviated form – in these grounds. The Glossary of Persons has been sorted alphabetically based on the second column. Where the relevant person is an individual, whose name has been abbreviated with their title (for example, “Mr Chen”), the alphabetical sorting includes that person’s title. The third column sets out that individual or corporation’s full name, a description of who they were, how they featured in this matter, whether they had been called to give evidence at the trial, and, if they did give evidence at the trial, the abbreviation used to mark exhibits arising from them (if any).S/NAbbreviated Name (if used)DetailsFull NameGave EvidenceDescription1 Advance AssetsAdvance Assets Management LtdNo.Advance Assets was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 21 May 2007, and its primary business was investment holdings.

Algo Capital was a company incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It was formed by Mr Tai, its sole shareholder and Director, to be the “Introducing Broker” for the 21 Relevant Accounts held with Saxo. This worked as follows. When the account opening forms for these 21 accounts were submitted to Saxo Bank, the accountholder would also indicate Algo Capital has the “Introducing Broker”. This allowed the company to earn a commission from Saxo, for trades conducted in these accounts. Algo Capital was also granted LPOAs to manage each of these 21 accounts.

 Her name was raised in the trial by the First Accused in connection with Mrs Lee SF and Mr Neo after the Crash when the SGX has suspended the trading of BAL shares (see [12]–[20] above). On the First Accused’s evidence, Mrs Lee SF, Mr Neo, and himself, discussed the suspension and planned to engage Mdm Yeo, who apparently refused to engage initially. It was only after the SGX had announced the resumption of trading on 6 October 2013 (see [17] above) that a discussion was said to have taken place between Mdm Yeo and Mrs Lee SF. The purpose of that discussion, on the First Accused’s evidence, was for Mrs Lee SF to persuade Mdm Yeo to defer the resumption of trading for two days in order to allow market participants to obtain the necessary funds to purchase BAL shares. This request was ultimately not acceded to.

 Appendix 4: Important Procedural and Evidential Decisions 1500 In this appendix, I set out five important procedural and evidential decisions that were taken in the course of the trial. I emphasise “important”. During the course of trial which spanned more than two years and involved around 200 hearing days, many procedural and evidential issues arose which required intermediate resolution. Not every one of those issues and my decisions needs to be canvassed in these grounds. 1501 Only five carried particular significance – these were my decisions on: (a) the Prosecution’s application to amend the initial charges for abetment by conspiracy to charges for criminal conspiracy; (b) the parties’ dispute over the Defence’s entitlement to various disclosures, over which the Prosecution asserted litigation privilege; (c) the Defence’s application to either permanently or temporarily stay these proceedings; (d) the parties’ dispute over the Defence’s entitlement to disclosures relating to Mr Gwee, over which both Mr Gwee and the Prosecution asserted plea negotiations privilege; and (e) the Defence’s submission that it did not have a case to answer in respect of the Deception, Cheating, and Witness Tampering Charges. The Prosecution’s application to amend the charges1502 As mentioned at [21] above, the Prosecution initially preferred charges for abetment by conspiracy against the accused persons instead of the criminal conspiracy charges ultimately proceeded on. Early in the trial, in July 2019, the Prosecution applied to amend those charges. This application was closely tied to several requests by the Defence for additional particulars, chiefly in relation to the False Trading, Price Manipulation and Deception Charges.1503 On 27 August 2019, I allowed the Prosecution’s amendment application and, on this date, I also ordered the exhibit C-B (the precursor to exhibit C-B1 referred to throughout these grounds; on this issue, also see [948]–[957] above) be marked as a part of the Prosecution’s opening statement. I explain my decision on these matters briefly.

1504 As regards the Prosecution’s application to amend, the parties were in agreement that the main consideration was whether the Defence would be prejudiced. In this connection, the Defence raised three principal arguments. One, that the offence of criminal conspiracy was wider than abetment by conspiracy as steps in pursuance of the conspiracy were required by the former but not the latter. By removing an element of the offence, the Defence contended that its strategy would have been affected. Two, in any event, given the Prosecution’s shift towards an offence under s 120B of the Penal Code – the focus of which was the accused persons’ alleged agreement and not their acts – there should have been a reduction in the number of charges, particularly Deception Charges. Three, the Prosecution’s proposed amended charges lacked particulars and such particulars needed to be furnished. 1505 In the round, I found that – as the application had been made relatively early in the proceedings – there was sufficient time for the Defence to review its strategy and meet the amended charges. As to the quantity of charges, I accepted the Prosecution could proceed on the same number of charges because they were seeking to prove multiple agreements, albeit under an overarching agreement (note that this informed the view I took from [977]–[983] above). As regards the Defence’s complaint that the amended charges did not contain sufficient particulars, I disagreed. I found that the charges contained enough information to make out offences under s 120A of the Penal Code read with either s 197(1)(b) or s 201(b) of the SFA. Thus, the information supplied by the Prosecution in respect of how they were alleging that the accused persons had instructed BAL trades in the Relevant Accounts (ie, exhibit C-B), did not need to be incorporated into the charges. It was more appropriately annexed to the Prosecution’s opening statement as a record of its evidential case. It should also be reiterated (see [953] above) that exhibit C-B was ultimately revised at the end of the Defence’s case and replaced with exhibit C-B1. 1506 Moreover, as discussed at [1319]–[1339] above, in deciding the Prosecution’s amendment application, a query arose as to what the Prosecution’s position was vis-à-vis whether the substantive offences underlying the Conspiracy Charges had been completed. The Defence initially pressed for the charges to state expressly that the underlying offences had been completed. The Prosecution was resistant to doing so on the grounds that, though it was their case that the underlying offences had been completed, doing so would impose an additional burden of proof on them which was not strictly required by s 120B of the Penal Code. In the event, however, they accepted that it was appropriate to include references to s 109 of the Penal Code as the applicable sentencing provision to make their position clear, and Mr Sreenivasan took the position that there was “no difference” from the charge stating expressly that the underlying offences had been committed.

The parties’ dispute over litigation privilege1507 Early in the trial, the Prosecution objected to the Defence’s cross-examination of several witnesses in relation to communications between those witnesses and the prosecutors or investigators on the grounds that such communications were covered by litigation privilege. Because of this objection, I had to determine: (a) whether the Prosecution was generally entitled to assert litigation privilege; and, if so, (b) whether such litigation privilege would protect the communications between witnesses and prosecutors or investigators specifically in the preparation of conditioned statements and in the preparation of those witnesses for giving evidence in court.1508 I ultimately determined the issue in favour of the Prosecution and found that it was entitled to assert litigation privilege over such communications. However, I observed that the scope of such privilege was narrower when claimed by the Prosecution in criminal proceedings. First, it was circumscribed by the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as set out in Kadar (No 1), Kadar (No 2), and now also Nabill. Second, it was also subject to a ‘necessity’ exception. I do not propose to delve into this any further as my reasoning in respect of these issues is set out fully in PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 1).The Defence’s application to stay proceedings1509 Approximately one year and three months following the commencement of the trial in March 2019, the accused persons filed a somewhat novel application for a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings on the grounds that the Prosecution’s conduct of the trial up until that point had seriously prejudiced them, and had consequently rendered a fair trial impossible. In the alternative, they asked that the proceedings be temporarily stayed on the condition that: (a) the Prosecution remedy its allegedly unsatisfactory conduct; (b) the Prosecution pay their costs; and (c) bail be granted to the First Accused.1510 I determined that the court had an inherent power to permanently stay criminal proceedings where it was impossible to give an accused person a fair trial, owing to delay or other reasons amounting to an abuse of process. However, it was doubtful whether there existed a power to grant a conditional stay of proceedings for an indefinite period unless and until the conditions were fulfilled. Even if such a remedy existed, I observed that it would likely be extremely limited. In any event, I held that neither a permanent nor a conditional stay (assuming one could even be given) was justified on the facts. Again, I will not go further into this matter as my decision on these matters is set out fully in PP v Soh Chee Wen (No 2).The parties’ dispute over plea negotiations privilege1511 As would be clear from [648]–[726] above, Mr Gwee was a significant figure in this case. I have stated above that Mr Gwee ultimately gave evidence as a witness for the Prosecution and, although the Prosecution itself took the view that Mr Gwee had downplayed his own involvement in the accused persons’ Scheme,

 This was not a point I dealt with in the main body of these grounds (particularly from [648]–[726], where the Manhattan House Group was discussed) because it did not affect any of my findings or my ultimate decision. Nevertheless, it is important that those circumstances – and the parties’ dispute about plea negotiations privilege which ensued therefrom – be explained.1512 During investigations, the CAD recorded multiple statements from Mr Gwee. The final statement he gave to the CAD was recorded on 31 July 2018. Thereafter, Mr Gwee did not give further statements to the CAD.

 confirmed that no such bargain had been reached.1515 However, on the basis that Mr Gwee’s evidence was not to be believed, and with a view to uncovering whether his Representations either contradicted his account in court, or, contained information that was more favourable to the accused persons, the Defence applied for their disclosure. Initially, the application was made against both the Prosecution and Mr Gwee, seemingly concurrently.

 However, after gaining some clarity on their legal position, the Defence reframed its position as turning on two questions to be answered sequentially: (a) whether Mr Gwee could be compelled to disclose the Representations; and if not, (b) whether the Prosecution could nevertheless be compelled to disclose them.

1516 Mr Gwee declined to disclose the Representations. The Prosecution made submissions in support of Mr Gwee’s position and relied on s 126(1) of the Evidence Act to resist disclosure on their own part. However, it was not necessary for me to deal with the application against the Prosecution or consider the applicability of s 126(1) of the Evidence Act. This was because, if it had been determined that Mr Gwee could not be compelled to produce the Representations, it followed that the Prosecution would equally not be compellable either by virtue of s 133 of the Evidence Act or by being the counterparty to those documents. Conversely, if Mr Gwee could be compelled, an application against the Prosecution would have been moot. The outcome of the Defence’s application thus turned entirely on whether Mr Gwee could be compelled to produce the Representations.1517 In relation to the application against Mr Gwee, there were two substantive legal issues which arose for consideration. First, whether privilege attached to the Representations, and, if so, what was the legal basis for such privilege. Second, if such privilege existed, whether disclosure ought to be ordered in the circumstances of this case. Ultimately, I did not allow the Defence’s application for disclosure. I handed down this decision orally on 12 April 2021 and I reproduce my reasons here:

I turn to the first issue. Relying on Public Prosecutor v Glenn Knight Jeyasingam [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1665 (“Glenn Knight”), all the parties accept that without prejudice privilege attaches to representations made to the Prosecution.

 a term which I shall use for the present purposes. Indeed, all parties accept that plea negotiations privilege survives Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 (“Phyllis Tan”) and they adopt the legal reasoning in Glenn Knight that this common law rule, which is not inconsistent with the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), exists.

 Given the common ground of parties, I will be proceeding on this premise, and it is the second issue that really falls to be determined.That said, I wish to highlight the reservations expressed in Phyllis Tan that the reasoning used in Glenn Knight to justify plea negotiations privilege did not sit comfortably with the EA. The court in Phyllis Tan stated at [118] that there is no provision in the EA that makes such representations inadmissible. They are, accordingly, admissible by virtue of s 2(2) of the EA. However, the court also said that “there is a long-established practice or convention that such representations are made ‘without prejudice’ and that the [Public Prosecutor] will not seek to admit them in evidence against the accused should the representations be rejected”. At [119] of Phyllis Tan, the court then went on to criticise the legal basis proffered by Glenn Knight for its decision, suggesting that the court should have, instead, simply relied on the above-mentioned convention. Although at [122] of Phyllis Tan, the court acknowledged that plea negotiations privilege at common law was not inconsistent with s 23 of the EA specifically, the court did not go so far as to say that the mere silence of the EA on this issue, or on any issue, meant that there was no inconsistency. Therefore, if I have to proceed on the basis suggested by Phyllis Tan, I note that these passages only deal with two-party cases. In my view, the convention should also exist in respect of cases involving third-party applications. There should be no dispute about this, given that the parties here have accepted the existence of plea negotiations privilege in three-party cases.In any case, my reasoning for finding that the convention should extend to three-party scenarios is as follows. The convention exists in two-party cases and binds the Prosecution because it is in their interests to preserve the sanctity and confidentiality of the plea negotiations process. The convention also exists in three-party cases and binds the Bar as applications for disclosure made against other suspects, accused persons or witnesses will, in the same stroke, undermine the confidentiality of representations made by their own clients and future clients.Accordingly, given that the sanctity of the plea negotiations process exists for the benefit of both sides in criminal proceedings, it is in both sides’ interests to honour this convention, save in exceptional circumstances. I note that it is not very clear what legal grounding Phyllis Tan had in mind when it suggested that in Glenn Knight the convention could have been relied on. My view is that the Prosecution and the Bar, as members of an honourable profession, are taken as agreeing not to seek or rely on any representations made to the Prosecution. In taking this view, I have reached an outcome which is, practically speaking, not too distinct from accepting that there is an exclusionary evidential rule of plea negotiations privilege.I turn now to the central issue in this case, whether the Defence ought to be bound by the plea negotiations privilege. There are two main strands to the Defence’s arguments. First, that in the case of an application by a third party for disclosure, the threshold set out in [66] of Glenn Knight, that is, the privilege can only be lifted after determination of criminal liability or after the negotiated plea has been made, ought not to be applied. This was especially emphasised by Mr Sui today.Second, on the basis that [66] of Glenn Knight does not apply, there are two aspects to the approach in R v Delorme [2005] NWTJ No 51 (“Delorme”) which the Defence proposes should be adopted. One, the disclosure of the representations will not prejudice Mr Gwee because the Defence cannot use them against him simply because they are not a prosecuting authority. I shall refer to this as the “prejudice point”. Two, that the representations are likely to contain material that will be helpful to the Defence. By this, the Defence mean that the representations might have “potential impeachment value”.

 Also, what was said in the representations would throw light on Mr Gwee’s motivations to testify and might affect his credibility. I shall refer to this as the “utility point”.I will take these arguments in turn. As to the Defence’s first argument, I am not entirely convinced by the Defence’s submission that the threshold in [66] of Glenn Knight should not apply. In any event, the Defence must still clear the approach they propose, which is that set out in Delorme.In relation to the prejudice point, the Defence submitted that the core prejudicial effect a representor may suffer from the disclosure of his representations is vis-à-vis the Prosecution relying on those representations against him in a trial.

 I broadly agree. Even if such representations are ordered by a court to be disclosed in separate proceedings, that may not entitle the Prosecution to then rely on them in criminal proceedings against a representor. By submitting that plea negotiations privilege is jointly held, it appears to me that the Prosecution also accepts this position. However, it is important to note that this is not the only prejudice which can result from disclosure. Where the plea negotiations process has not closed, this puts the process at risk, depending on the consequences which follow the disclosure. In the present case, given that Mr Gwee has not been dealt with, this weighs heavily in favour of Mr Wendell Wong and the Prosecution’s position. Further, prejudice vis-à-vis the Prosecution is not the only prejudice which may arise. Once confidential information enters the public domain and is released, a representor may be exposed to civil and other forms of liability in relation to the third-party request or even other parties. This uncertainty weighs in favour of guarding against disclosure.In relation to the utility point, I am not convinced that the representations contain material that will be useful or helpful to the Defence, at least no more so than which has come up during the course of his cross-examination. Mr Jiang has stated on record that Mr Gwee’s representations contained requests,

 and the Prosecution confirmed in its submission that the contents of the representations do not engage its Kadar obligations.

 I take this to mean that there is nothing in the representations which is directly beneficial to the accused persons, meaning that they are either neutral or detrimental.As such, I do not agree with the Defence that they require the representations for impeachment purposes. In fact, I do not think there is impeachment value since the inconsistencies with Mr Gwee’s testimony in court would more likely be found in the absence of certain contents from the investigative statements rather than in the actual contents within the representations.Further, I do not agree that the Defence requires the representations in order to have a proper opportunity to test Mr Gwee’s evidence, “to see if he had any motivation to lie or embellish his testimony” in the hopes of having his request acceded to by the Prosecution.

 In this connection, I do not agree with Mr Sui that knowing the specific nature of the request made by Mr Gwee would benefit the Defence. The fact and the mere fact of the request suffices for the Defence to challenge Mr Gwee’s credibility.There is ample evidence for the Defence to make submissions as to Mr Gwee’s lack of credibility or, indeed, to apply to impeach him had they wished to do so. As the Defence themselves noted of Delorme, the representations must contain “added information not already or otherwise available to the defence or has some potential impeachment value”.

 I do not think that the representations would contain any added information that is of further utility to the defence. Even if there is some utility to the Defence being granted the representations, this utility is marginal at best. In my view, it does not justify an incursion on the general principle that communications exchanged in plea negotiations are to be kept confidential.As a final observation, I note Mr Sreenivasan’s point that the fact that Mr Gwee has not been dealt with was entirely of the Prosecution’s own doing, and that, in fairness to the Defence, the privilege should be lifted even though the plea negotiation process has not concluded. Even if I were to accept his point, the Defence has not cleared the approach set out in Delorme, especially on the utility point, which is the test or approach they propose to be adopted.In conclusion, I should add that even if I were to frame the second issue in terms of whether the Defence should be bound by a convention rather than plea negotiations privilege, based on the same reasons discussed above, I would find that based on the present circumstances, they should be so bound.I shall reiterate again that protecting the sanctity of the plea negotiations process requires more than just ensuring that a particular representor is not prejudiced; it also involves protecting the practice as a whole. In my view, disclosure in the present case where the utility of disclosure, if any, is likely to be marginal, it will be harmful to the confidence in this process. I therefore do not allow the Defence’s application for disclosure of the representations.[footnotes added]The Defence’s submission of ‘no case to answer’1518 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the accused persons submitted that they did not have a case to answer in respect of several groups of charges. First and foremost were the Deception Charges, in respect of which both the First and Second Accused had argued (for different reasons, organised around different specific charges) that they did not have a case to answer. The First Accused additionally submitted that there was no case to answer vis-à-vis the Cheating Charges as well as the Witness Tampering Charges. There was no dispute that there was a case to answer in respect of the False Trading, Price Manipulation and Company Management Charges. 1519 The Second Accused filed her ‘no case to answer’ written submissions on 1 April 2021, the First Accused did so on 5 April, and the Prosecution filed its written reply on 19 April 2021. On 21 April, I then heard the parties’ oral arguments. I reserved judgment, and, on 28 April 2021, I handed down my decision. In short, I found that a case to answer had been established in respect of all but one Deception Charge (also see [4(b)] above). That was the Deception Charge pertaining to the account Ms Lim SH held with UOB Kay Hian under the management of Ms Chua.

 To explain the basis of this acquittal, I reproduce the relevant portions of the judgment I handed down on 28 April:IntroductionAt the close of the Prosecution’s case, the accused persons submitted that they have no case to answer in respect of certain charges brought against them. The arguments made concerned seven groups of charges. I shall deal with each group in turn.…Group 5 comprises 21 Deception Charges only as against the Second Accused As argued by Mr Sui, Group 5 has eight sub-groups.…Subgroup 4: One UOB Kay Hian account of Ms Lim SHI next turn to the UOB Kay Hian account of Ms Lim SH, ie, Charge 153. It is not disputed that in relation to this account, trade instructions were given solely by the Second Accused to Ms Chua. Mr Sui’s submission is simply that the Second Accused was authorised to place trades in the account. As such, there can be no deception insofar as her involvement in instructing trades is concerned. The Prosecution’s reply was that she nevertheless effected a deception on the FI by concealing the fact that the “BAL orders and trades given in this account were not for or on behalf of [Ms Lim SH], but for herself and [the First Accused]”. The Prosecution’s argument does not accord with the plain wording of the charge – that the Second Accused concealed her and the First Accused’s involvement “in the instructing of orders and trades”. From the outset of this case, as emphasised by the Prosecution in respect of the Deception Charges, the involvement meant that such instructions were either given directly to the TRs by the First Accused and/or the Second Accused or indirectly by the First Accused and/or the Second Accused through the accountholders or other authorised persons. The notion of true purpose, the exercise of control or beneficial ownership of the trades do not feature in the Deception Charges. As such, given that the Second Accused’s involvement was known to and approved by the FI, she simply could not have concealed her involvement.In my view, the Prosecution’s argument goes beyond the plain wording of the charge. More critically, it alters the nature of the Prosecution’s case in relation to the Deception Charges. I note that in IO-F – ie, the list of 189 Relevant Accounts – there are 26 controlled accounts listed as A1 to A26 which do not form the subject matter of the Deception Charges. These comprise 16 accounts belonging to the Second Accused, and nine accounts belonging to certain companies with the Second Accused as the authorised signatory. The remaining account, A26, is one belonging to Mr Neo in respect of which the Second Accused held a limited power of attorney to instruct trades. When queried about the apparent inconsistency in the treatment of the accounts (ie, why the accounts numbered in A1 to A26 are not subject matter of deception charges but that the account of Ms Lim SH is), Mr Jiang responded that this is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.

 However, it seems to me that IO-F is consistent with the fact that the Prosecution’s case is that the deception concerns the concealment of the giving of instructions of trades (without consent of the FIs), and that the case is not about the deception regarding the true purpose of the accounts. Put in another way, the Deception Charges are meant to focus on the unauthorised roles of the accused persons in instructing orders and trades. The only tolerable amendment to this charge at this stage would be to state that the accused persons conspired to conceal the First Accused’s involvement, as opposed to both of their involvements. Indeed, in the Prosecution’s submissions, it is argued that “[the First Accused’s] involvement in the instruction of BAL orders and trades has also been concealed”. Even so, there must still be evidence of his involvement – for example, in the giving of orders through the Second Accused akin to the relaying thesis adopted by the Prosecution. As Mr Sui pointed out, at the stage of amending the Deception Charges, the Prosecution submitted that even if only one of the accused persons gave instructions directly or indirectly, the other was involved if he or she: (a) influenced the trading decisions, etc; (b) exercised negative control over the trading decisions, etc; (c) funded the trades or made arrangements for funding of the trades, etc; or (d) monitored the trades as part of the overall criminal enterprise. To this end, the Prosecution highlighted three pieces of evidence: (a) that the accused persons were monitoring the shareholding in this account; (b) an email from the Second Accused to the First Accused stating that she has the CDP statements of Ms Lim SH, and referring to the First Accused’s “noms”; and (c) a conversation by the First Accused with Ms Cheng referring to Ms Lim SH as the Second Accused’s nominee. I note that at the highest, such evidence fall in the last two categories of funding and monitoring the trades in the account. While such evidence may indicate knowledge by the First Accused of the existence and usage of the account, there is no evidence falling in the first two categories which would show his involvement in the giving of instructions. Given the Second Accused’s authorisation, it is not enough for the First Accused to simply have known of the existence and usage of this account. Based on the wording of the charge, the First Accused must have been involved in the giving of instructions for the orders and trades in this account. More evidence, such as evidence falling within the first two categories of involvement, is required. Having considered the evidence, I find that there is no such evidence. For completeness, I should add that in this context, relying on the evidence of the broad scheme does not assist.I accordingly acquit both accused persons of this charge. I note, however, that this decision does not require this account to be removed from IO-F. The absence of a deception on the FI in this instance does not necessarily mean that the account was not used in connection with the broad scheme alleged. The fact that the Second Accused had instructed trades in this account, the pattern of trading which can be seen in UOBKH-8, and the appearance of this account in the shareholding schedule, provide some support for its use as a controlled account. However, this is a matter to be considered in due course. …
