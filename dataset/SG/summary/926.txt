SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE11 April 2022Case summaryPradeepto Kumar Biswas v Sabyasachi Mukherjee and another and another matter [2022] SGCA 31Originating Summonses Nos 24 and 25 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice of the Court of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong):Outcome: CoA dismisses applications for retrials of two suits. Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The Court of Appeal does not have the power to order a retrial independent of an appeal pending before it. The applicants had brought OS 24 and 25 without a pending appeal and accordingly, they were both dismissed for lack of jurisdiction: at [34]–[35].•  It would not be proper for a court to determine allegations of perjury/fraud based on affidavit evidence alone: at [54], [79]–[83].•  The Court of Appeal reiterated that it remains the duty of lawyers, as officers of the court, to advise their clients properly and to ensure that the court’s processes are not abused in a wanton fashion: at [92]. Background 1 The applicants in OS 24 and OS 25 were the unsuccessful parties in two suits that had been disposed of before the High Court. The respondents were the successful parties in both suits. With regard to these two suits, the applicants filed appeals that were later struck out or deemed as withdrawn. 2 Two years later, the applicants commenced OS 24 and OS 25 under s 60A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”), seeking retrials of the respective suits, arguing that the respondents had committed perjury in the conduct of the two suits and thus there was a miscarriage of justice.Decision3 It was clear that the court’s power to order a retrial under s 60A of the SCJA could only be exercised where it had been seised of appellate jurisdiction. But the applicants did not have any pending appeals and thus the court was without jurisdiction to order a retrial. Both applications were accordingly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction: at [29], [34]–[35]. 4 Further, even if the court had jurisdiction, it would not have done so as the applications lacked merit and, in any event, were abuses of process. a. First, the applications lacked merit as the evidence relied upon by the applicants were either readily available at trial or did not show that there was a miscarriage of justice: at [49]–[50], [65], [72], [73].b. Second, the applications were abuses of process. As regard to OS 24, there were several other actions commenced by the applicants against the respondents that would grant them the same relief – this indicated a desire to oppress the respondents through heavy litigation: at [82], [85]. As regards OS 25, there were issues in that application that could have and should have been raised earlier at trial but were not – accordingly, this was an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of res judicata: at [86]–[88].5 The court ordered costs of S$20,000 on an indemnity basis as OS 24 and OS 25 fulfilled all four categories of objectionable conduct warranting such costs – the applications were brought in bad faith, were speculative and without basis and amounted to wasteful and duplicative litigation. Furthermore, the conduct of the applicant in OS 24 could be described as dishonest, abusive and improper. The only reason the quantum of costs ordered was not higher was due to the relatively simple nature of the applications, and counsel’s reasonable conduct of his case at the oral hearing: at [94]–[96].
