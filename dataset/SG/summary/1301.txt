SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE13 July 2021 Case summaryTMRG Pte Ltd and another v Caerus Holding Pte Ltd and another [2021] SGHC 163Suit No 723 of 2020--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the General Division of the High Court (delivered by Judicial Commissioner Andre Maniam):Outcome: The High Court dismisses the plaintiffs’ claims against the defendants for trade mark infringement, invalidity and passing off. The plaintiffs’ mark (“LOBCH trade mark”) and the defendants’ marks (“LL word mark” and “LL logo” respectively, and collectively, “LL trade marks”) are as follows:  LOBCH trade markLL trade marksLL word markLL logoPertinent and significant points of the judgmentThe plaintiffs’ trade mark is not “Luke’s”, it is: Luke’s / Oyster Bar / Chop House / Travis Masiero Restaurant Group. Neither are the LL trade marks just “Luke’s”: they are Luke’s Lobster, with “lobster” either in word form or graphically depicted by the lobster device. Taking into account these differences, the LOBCH trade mark and LL trade marks were visually, phonetically and conceptually dissimilar. Adopting a mark-centric approach, there is no likelihood of confusion between the marks. It was also significant that the plaintiffs made sparse use of the LOBCH trade mark, and that its restaurants would not have been known by many.While the plaintiffs had goodwill in its restaurant business, there is no confusion with the plaintiffs’ restaurants and misrepresentation by the defendants’ opening of “Luke’s Lobster” in Singapore. Even if there had been confusion, the plaintiffs have not proven that they had suffered damage. There were several deficiencies in the plaintiffs’ survey evidence. In particular, the survey had used an unregistered logo, rather than the registered LOBCH trade mark that is the subject of the present proceedings. The survey questions were also leading and shaped interviewees’ thinking. Accordingly, no weight was placed on the survey in so far as it is said to show a likelihood of confusion between the marks. The material facts1 The first plaintiff operates the “Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House” restaurant in Singapore at Gemmill Lane, which opened in May 2011. The second plaintiff operated another restaurant by the same name at The Heeren from 2014 until it closed in December 2020. Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House is a fine dining restaurant. It had been named after the son of restaurateur Travis Masiero (“Mr Masiero”), Lucas. 2 The first plaintiff is the registered owner of the LOBCH trade mark in Class 43. While the LOBCH trade mark is used on the shopfront window of the plaintiffs’ Gemmill Lane restaurant and on the business cards of its representatives, it is another – unregistered – mark that was most commonly in use, including on the plaintiffs’ social media, website, menu and products (“LOBCH logo”). 3 The second defendant is a United States company. It opened the first “Luke’s Lobster” shack in New York City in October 2009. Since then, some 37 Luke’s Lobster shacks have opened outside the US through franchisees. These shacks are casual self-service and grab-and-go restaurants. Luke’s Lobster is named after its co-founder and CEO Lucas Alexander Holden, who is known as “Luke Holden”. 4 The first defendant is the exclusive Singapore franchisee of Luke’s Lobster, and opened a Luke’s Lobster shack at Isetan, Shaw House in September 2020, and another at Jewel, Changi Airport in January 2021. 5 The second defendant is the registered owner of the LL trade marks in Class 43. 6 Luke’s Lobster’s best-selling product is its lobster rolls. The plaintiffs contend that their restaurants also have an established reputation for lobster dishes. 7 In July 2020, the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants were intending to open Luke’s Lobster in Singapore. They commenced proceedings against the defendants for trade mark infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA”), passing off and a declaration that the LL trade marks are invalid pursuant to s 23 of the TMA. The court’s grounds of decision8 The High Court dismissed all of the plaintiffs’ claims. Trade mark infringement9 The court found that the marks were dissimilar, and there was no likelihood of confusion. 10 With regards to visual similarity, the LL trade marks are not visually similar to the LOBCH trade mark, and the LL logo is particularly dissimilar: at [50]. The LOBCH trade mark has nine words and 51 letters: Luke’s / Oyster Bar / Chop House / Travis Masiero Restaurant Group: at [28], [32]. On the other hand, the defendants’ LL word mark has two words and 12 letters, while the LL logo has one word, five letters and a lobster device: at [32]. The font, typeface and design of the LOBCH trade mark and the LL trade marks are also different: at [33] and [61].  11 The court found the plaintiffs’ contention, that “Luke’s” alone is distinctive of their restaurants, to be without merit: at [49]. A commonly used personal name is generally considered to be of low distinctiveness: at [37]. What contributes to the LOBCH trade mark as a whole being distinctive of the plaintiffs’ restaurants, and differentiates them from other “Luke’s” establishments, are the words “Oyster Bar, ‘Chop House” and “Travis Masiero Restaurant Group”: at [46]. 12 The LL trade marks are not phonetically similar to the LOBCH trade mark: at [56]. The marks only had one syllable in common - “Luke’s” - which is of low distinctiveness: at [52] and [54]. 13 The marks are conceptually dissimilar: at [62]. The phrases “Oyster Bar” and “Chop House” in the LOBCH trade mark bring to mind a place, while the LL trade marks bring to mind an animal (the lobster) or a type of food (lobster), rather than a place: at [59]. Unlike the LOBCH trade mark, which indicates that Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House is part of the “Travis Masiero Restaurant Group”, the LL trade marks do not make reference to any restaurant group, or any person other than the eponymous “Luke’s”: at [60]. The LOBCH trade mark gives an impression of formality and sophistication, while the LL trade marks come across as causal and playful (especially the LL logo): at [61].14 At the goods/services-similarity stage, the court accepted that the LL trade marks are used in relation to goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the LOBCH trade mark is registered, because the marks were registered in the same specification within Class 43: at [64]-[65]. 15 Adopting a mark-centric approach, the court concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion given the non-similarity (or low similarity) of the marks, the sparse use the plaintiffs made of the LOBCH trade mark as compared to the LOBCH logo (coupled with Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House not being known by many) and some degree of fastidiousness expected of prospective purchasers in relation to restaurant services: at [82] and [102]. 16 No weight was placed on the plaintiffs’ survey evidence in so far as it is said to show a likelihood of confusion because the survey had a number of deficiencies: at [87] and [241]. 17 First, it was the unregistered LOBCH logo, rather than the LOBCH trade mark, that had been used for the survey: at [192]-[196]. 18 Second, the 266 participants of the survey were all customers of the plaintiffs, and did not represent the relevant cross-section of the public, which comprises the plaintiffs’ actual and potential customers: at [197]-[199]. 19 Third, the questions in the survey did not directly ascertain the cause of any confusion, and were not limited to marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity: at [200]-[203]. 20 Fourth, the survey’s questions were leading and shaped interviewees’ thinking: at [204]-[227]. The questions reinforced the association of the plaintiffs’ restaurants with “Luke’s” and referred to the plaintiffs’ restaurants as “Luke’s” even if the interviewees had not initially thought of them as such: at [206]-[214] and [222]-[224]. 21 Fifth, there was late disclosure of the whole survey as the 266 original questionnaires were only provided shortly before trial commenced: at [238]. 22 Sixth, the survey also did not facilitate a like-for-like comparison of the get-up of the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ restaurants under actual market conditions: at [240]. 23 The court found the alleged evidence of actual confusion to be of no assistance to the plaintiffs on the issue of confusion: at [102]. The verbatim comments made by two of the survey participants did not show that they had made purchases at the defendants’ Luke’s Lobster shack thinking that it was associated with the plaintiffs’ restaurants, and in any event, was inadmissible hearsay: at [89]-[91] and [93]-[96]. The emails sent by five different individuals to the plaintiffs did not show confusion at the point of purchase: at [98]-[99]. While one “J” had location tagged the defendants’ Luke’s Lobster shack at Isetan as “Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House” in her Facebook post, that was not good evidence that she thought she was at one of the plaintiffs’ restaurants, and it did not show confusion at the point of purchase: at [100]-[101]. “Own name” defence24 The court found that, even if the marks were similar and there were a likelihood of confusion, the defendants would have been entitled to rely on the “own name” defence under s 28(1)(a) of the TMA: at [112]-[113]. 25 “Luke’s Lobster” was a trading name which the second defendant has used since its inception prior to the opening of the plaintiffs’ first restaurant in 2011: at [106]. The second defendant’s use of that name is in accordance with the “honest practices” proviso to s 28 of the TMA: at [107]. Its registration of the LL trade marks in Singapore in 2018 was also unopposed by the plaintiffs: at [108]-[110]. 26 In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the second defendant to think that it could open lobster shacks in Singapore under the name “Luke’s Lobster” (as all its other shacks were named), and it was entitled to rely on the “own name” defence: at [111]-[112]. The first defendant, as the exclusive licensee of the second defendant, is similarly entitled to rely on the “own name” defence: at [113]. “Registered mark” defence27 The court concluded that the registration of the LL trade marks was not to be declared invalid and so the defendants would also have the benefit of the “registered mark” defence under s 28(3) of the TMA if the marks were similar and there were a likelihood of confusion: at [189]-[190]. Passing off28 The court found that the defendants are not liable for passing off by opening Luke’s Lobster in Singapore: at [173]. 29 The court accepted that the plaintiffs had goodwill in its Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House restaurant business, which is associated, not with “Luke’s” alone, but with the restaurants being known as oyster bars and chop houses, with the Travis Masiero Restaurant Group (which is part of the LOBCH trade mark) and also with restaurateur Mr Masiero (whose name is part of the LOBCH logo): at [121]-[122]. 30 However, there was no misrepresentation by the defendants’ use of the name “Luke’s Lobster”: at [156]. 31 There are significant differences in style, price, range and type of food and services between the plaintiffs’ restaurants and the defendants’ Luke’s Lobster shacks: at [132]. The plaintiffs’ restaurants are spacious fine dining establishments while the defendants’ restaurants are small, causal, grab-and-go outlets with limited seating: at [134]-[135]. The variety of items on offer at the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ restaurant menu also differ significantly: at [137]-[139]. An average trip to the plaintiffs’ restaurant costs some two to three times more than the total cost of ordering the most expensive food and drink items at the defendants’ restaurant: at [140]. 32 The court found the plaintiffs’ claim to fame in relation to lobster dishes (which the defendants’ Luke’s Lobster shacks are known for) to be somewhat exaggerated: at [141]-[142]. Lobster-related dishes have contributed only around 5% of the plaintiffs’ total revenue: at [143]. While the plaintiffs’ restaurant has been named as being among the places in Singapore selling lobster rolls, that is not on its main menu, and is only available at lunch: at [142] and [144]. It is as an Oyster Bar, and Chop House, that the plaintiffs’ restaurants are better known for: at [144]. 33 The plaintiffs have not shown, by reference to its “Lobster Shack” takeaway event, which it held on two weekends in June 2020 during the near ten-week period in 2020 when dining-in was not allowed due to COVID-19 restrictions, that it was in a similar market segment with the defendants: at [147]-[154]. Even if the plaintiffs do expand into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market, they do not intend to use the name “Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House”, as is evident from their use of an entirely different mark for the Lobster Shack event: at [149]-[150]. 34 The absence of a likelihood of confusion on a mark-centric approach which the court found earlier was relevant to the passing off claim and rendered it weaker than the plaintiffs’ claim for trade mark infringement given the wider range of extraneous factors applicable to a passing off claim, which differentiated the parties further: at [156]. 35 Even if there had been some likelihood of confusion, the plaintiffs have a poor case on damage, which is also not made out: at [157]-[158]. The plaintiffs have adduced no evidence of direct loss of sales: at [159]. The plaintiffs have also not been restricted from expanding into the takeaway / grab and go / lobster shack market, and they remain free to do so: at [165]-[166]. The plaintiffs, which trade name is “Luke’s Oyster Bar & Chop House”, also did not lose exclusivity in the trade name “Luke’s” as a result of Luke’s Lobster opening in Singapore: at [167].36 The court did not accept that the plaintiffs’ reputation and brand would suffer if a customer of Luke’s Lobster perceived some association between the defendants’ and the plaintiffs’ restaurants, just because Luke’s Lobster does not offer a fine dining experience: at [163]. 37 Finally, even if there had been any confusion, it was only initial interest confusion that would not persist to the point of purchase, and would not have relieved the plaintiff of the need to go further in proving damage, since such confusion is not inherently likely to cause damage: at [172]. Validity38 The court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim that the LL trade marks are invalid: at [189]. 39 The court found that the LL trade marks do not offend against s 8(2) of the TMA. The court’s decision on marks-similarity and goods/services-similarity applies equally to the invalidity claim. With regards to the confusion analysis, broadening that to include notional fair uses to which the LL trade marks may be put for the purposes of the invalidity claim does not lead to any difference in outcome: at [187]. 40 Given the court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ passing off claim, the LL trade marks do not offend against s 8(7) of the TMA as its use is not liable to be prevented by the law of passing off: at [188]. Conclusion41 For the reasons above, the plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed. This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
