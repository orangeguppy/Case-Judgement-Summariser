SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE12 October 2022Case summaryGoh Ngak Eng v Public Prosecutor [2022] SGHC 254--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the High Court (delivered by Vincent Hoong J):Outcome: High Court adopts a sentencing framework for offences under ss 6(a) and (b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (the “PCA”), and enhances the appellant’s sentence to 37 months’ and three weeks’ imprisonment.  Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The High Court sets out a sentencing framework for private sector corruption offences under ss 6(a) and (b) of the PCA.Background1 The appellant was a director of Megamarine Services Pte Ltd, a company in the business of manufacturing and repairing air winches and general trading of equipment. Sometime in late-2014, he was approached by one Rajavikraman s/o Jayapandian (“Raj”), who said that he would be able to refer jobs from Keppel FELS (“KFELS”) to vendors. Raj explained that he knew someone in KFELS called “Alvin” (referring to one Alvin Lim Wee Lun (“Lim”)), who was in a position to recommend to whom the jobs would be awarded. The parties then entered into an arrangement whereby Raj and the appellant would seek vendors for jobs in KFELS and would ask for their invoices to be marked by up more than 15%. The mark-up was to be shared between Lim (who wanted 15% of the invoice value of the jobs), Raj and the appellant.2 The appellant subsequently pleaded guilty before a District Court judge (the “DJ”) to 15 charges of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with two others to corruptly obtain gratification under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the PCA (the “Conspiracy Charges”) and four charges of corruptly giving gratification under s 6(b) of the PCA (the “Non-Conspiracy Charges”). A total of 40 remaining charges (of which 31 were abetment by conspiracy charges while nine were s 6(b) charges) were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The DJ imposed a global sentence of 17 months and three weeks’ imprisonment. DecisionThe appropriate sentencing framework for private sector corruption offences under ss 6(a) and (b) of the PC3 The court declined to follow the sentencing framework that was developed for private sector corruption offences under ss 6(a) and (b) of the PCA in Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters [2021] 4 SLR 160 (“Masui (HC)”). That framework was excessively complex and technical, making it prone to confusion and uncertainty and thus rendering it of limited assistance to sentencing courts. The approach taken in Masui (HC) was also founded on various erroneous assumptions: at [34]-[44].4 The appropriate sentencing framework for ss 6(a) and (b) offences under the PCA was modelled after the two-stage, five-step framework in Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor [2018] 4 SLR 609. Under the first step of the framework, the court would identify the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s culpability. The offence-specific factors that were identified by the High Court in Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal [2020] 5 SLR 807 (“Wong Chee Meng”), which had set out a sentencing framework for the aggravated offence of participating in a corrupt transaction with agents under s 6 read with s 7 of the PCA, were equally applicable and relevant to offences of private sector corruption under ss 6(a) and (b). Further offence-specific factors were also applicable. Hence, the offence-specific factors to be included were (with the factors in addition to those already set out in Wong Chee Meng emphasised in italics): at [59]-[95]:Offence-specific factorsFactors going towards harmFactors going towards culpability(a) Actual loss caused to principal(b) Benefit to the giver of gratification (c) Type and extent of loss to third parties(d) Public disquiet (e) Offences committed as part of a group or syndicate (f) Involvement of a transnational element (g) Whether the public service rationale is engaged (h) Presence of public health or safety risks (i) Involvement of a strategic industry (j) Bribery of a foreign public official (a) Amount of gratification given or received (b) Degree of planning and premeditation(c) Level of sophistication(d) Duration of offending(e) Extent of the offender’s abuse of position and breach of trust(f) Offender’s motive in committing the offence(g) Presence of threats, pressure or coercion (h) The role played by the offender in the corrupt transaction 5 At step two of the framework, the court would identify the applicable indicative sentencing range, by reference to the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s culpability. Having regard to the stipulated sentencing range for offences under ss 6(a) and (b) of the PCA, the following indicative starting sentences were appropriate: at [96]-[103]:           Harm   CulpabilitySlightModerateSevereLowFine or up to 6 months’ imprisonment6 to 12 months’ imprisonment1 to 2 years’ imprisonmentMedium6 to 12 months’ imprisonment1 to 2 years’ imprisonment2 to 3 years’ imprisonmentHigh1 to 2 years’ imprisonment2 to 3 years’ imprisonment3 to 5 years’ imprisonment6 The parties did not dispute the subsequent steps to be applied under the sentencing framework. The third step would be to identify the appropriate starting point within that range, having regard to the same offence-specific factors as those considered at the first step. The fourth step involved making adjustments to the indicative starting point to take into account offender-specific factors, ie, established aggravating and mitigating factors personal to the offender. At the fifth step, where an offender had been convicted of multiple charges, the court would consider the need to make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle: at [104].The appellant’s sentence 7 In relation to the Conspiracy Charges, the DJ had taken the view that the only harm-related offence-specific factor was that of potential detriment, in the form of a possibility that there could be an unsuitable vendor which could then lead to “disastrous consequences”. However, it seemed that all those in the court below (including the DJ) failed to appreciate that the whole modus operandi of the offences was to cause the amounts paid by KFELS to be inflated in order to fund the bribes ultimately paid to the appellant, Raj and Lim. KFELS was therefore the victim in that it paid significantly more than what it would otherwise have for the subject services. There was therefore real and actual economic detriment suffered by KFELS: at [107]-[108].8 Several other harm-related offence-specific factors that had not been canvassed in the proceedings below were also relevant. The sentences considered to be appropriate by the court in respect of the Conspiracy Charges were therefore far higher than those imposed by the DJ. As for the Non-Conspiracy Charges, these were assessed as being of slight harm/low culpability: at [106], [109], [113]-[114].9 An enhancement of the sentences for each of the Conspiracy Charges was necessary to fit the severity of the subject offences, despite the absence of a cross-appeal by the Prosecution. The sentences imposed by the DJ in respect of the Conspiracy Charges were therefore set aside, and replaced with the sentences arrived at by applying the revised sentencing framework. The sentences imposed by the DJ in respect of the Non-Conspiracy Charges were however not disturbed. The resulting global sentence was 37 months and three weeks’ imprisonment: at [129]-[130], [132].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
