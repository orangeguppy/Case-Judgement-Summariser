SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE14 July 2023Case summaryPublic Prosecutor v Tan Teck Leong Melvin [2023] SGHC 188--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the General Division of the High Court (comprising Sundaresh Menon CJ, Tay Yong Kwang JCA and Vincent Hoong J) (Judgment delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JCA):Outcome: High Court allows Prosecution’s appeal in part against sentence imposed on the offender who fraudulently evaded $600,000 in GST by increasing the offender’s default imprisonment term from 24 months to 36 months.Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The High Court set out sentencing frameworks for the offence of fraudulent evasion of Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) under s 128D of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Customs Act”) and for default imprisonment terms for fines imposed under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act: at [54], [67] and [68].•  Applying the new sentencing frameworks, the total fine of $3m imposed on the respondent was ordered to stand but the respondent’s total default imprisonment term was increased from 24 months to 36 months: at [77].Background 1 The respondent was the sole proprietor of T.L Freight (“TL”), which was a freight forwarder that shipped consolidated cargoes from China to Singapore. He was responsible for creating a consolidated packing list for each shipment.2 Between 2016 and 2019, the respondent falsified various consolidated packing lists by lowering the value of the goods in the consolidated packing lists at random. The falsified consolidated packing lists were then provided to TL’s declaring agents. Relying on these falsified consolidated packing lists, the declaring agents under-declared to Singapore Customs (“Customs”) the value of the goods imported by TL. The respondent knew that by declaring a lower value, he would pay less GST for the imported goods. The respondent prepaid the lower amounts of GST to his declaring agents who then paid the amounts to Customs. 3 After the imported goods were received in Singapore, the respondent charged his buyers GST based on the actual higher value of the goods instead of the falsified lower value in the consolidated packing lists. The respondent pocketed the difference between the higher amount of GST that he received from his buyers and the lower amount of GST that he had prepaid to his declaring agents. He committed the offences for his own personal gain as he was deep in debt from various loans that he had obtained from banks and from his family in Singapore and in China.4 The respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court to three charges of fraudulently evading GST under s 128D and punishable under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. The charges were amalgamated charges under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and were framed to reflect the amounts of GST evaded in the years 2016, 2017 and 2019 (ie, approximately $182,000, $219,000 and $201,000 respectively). The total amount of GST evaded by the respondent (in relation to the three charges proceeded on) was thus around $600,000.5 The respondent admitted to six other similar offences and consented to having them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). The TIC charges were also amalgamated charges for the fraudulent evasion of GST under s 128D of the Customs Act and covered the period from October 2016 to January 2020.6 The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced the respondent to a fine of $1m (in default eight months’ imprisonment) for each of the three charges. The aggregate sentence was therefore a fine of $3m (in default 24 months’ imprisonment).7 The Prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the DJ on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. The Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework for the offence under s 128D of the Customs Act, as well as for default imprisonment terms for fines imposed under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. Applying these frameworks to the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the respondent should be sentenced to a total fine of $3.5m to $4m (in default 39 to 42 months’ imprisonment).8 The respondent supported the adoption of sentencing frameworks but urged the court to apply any sentencing framework prospectively and not to the present appeal. The respondent contended that the sentence imposed by the DJ was not manifestly inadequate and therefore should not be disturbed.DecisionThe sentencing framework for fraudulent evasion of GST under s 128D of the Customs Act9 The court considered the Prosecution’s proposed framework to be a viable working model on which a sentencing framework for the offence under s 128D could be formulated. The court adopted the following three-step framework. At the first step, the court derives the indicative fine based on the amount of GST evaded, using the following framework (at [40]):Amount of GST evadedMultiplier applied to each bracketRange of indicative fine$1 to $250× 12$12 to $3,000$251 to $1,000× 10$3,010 to $10,500$1,001 to $10,000× 8$10,508 to $82,500$10,001 to $100,000× 6$82,506 to $622,500$100,001 to $500,000× 4$622,504 to $2,222,500$500,001 to $1m× 3$2,222,503 to $3,722,500>$1m× 2> $3,722,50010 The multiplier values set out at each level of the framework would apply cumulatively, in the same way that income tax was computed in Singapore. For instance, where the amount of GST evaded was $10,000, the indicative fine would be (12 × $250) + (10 × $750) + (8 × $9,000) = $82,500. The cumulative method of computation would prevent an offender from getting a more lenient sentence simply because he crossed over into the next higher level on the scale. The decreasing rate in the multiplier would guard against the risk of disproportionately high fines as the amount of GST evaded increased: at [41] and [42].11 The framework above applies to first-time offenders who plead guilty at the earliest available opportunity and should be used to calculate the indicative fine based on the amount of GST evaded per charge, rather than the total amount of GST evaded across all the charges proceeded on: at [45] and [46].12 The second step is for the court to identify the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors before adjusting the indicative fine upwards or downwards accordingly. The court set out the following non-exhaustive list of factors (at [48]):Aggravating factors(a) Involvement of a syndicate(b) Involvement of a transnational element(c) Degree of planning and premeditation(d) Sophistication of the methods used to evade GST or to avoid detection(e) Evidence of a sustained period of offending(f) Offender’s role(g) Abuse of position and breach of trust (including a breach of professional responsibilities)(h) Evidence of offender making a personal monetary gain(i) Offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing(j) Relevant antecedents(k) Lack of remorseMitigating factors(a) Voluntary restitution (b) Cooperation with authorities13 The court could adjust the indicative fine by making a lump sum adjustment or by modifying the applicable multiplier, which could include fractions (eg, 4.5 times) if appropriate: at [52].14 The third and final step is for the court to consider whether further adjustments should be made on account of the totality principle. Especially where the offender is of limited financial means, it might be relevant to consider whether the overall fine quantum is just and appropriate: at [53]. The framework for default imprisonment terms under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act15 The appropriate framework calibrates the default imprisonment term based on the fine imposed for each charge, rather than the total fine imposed for all the charges proceeded on. The latter approach would have the effect of treating multiple proceeded charges as a single amalgamated charge, thereby circumventing the provisions in the CPC on the amalgamation of charges: at [66].16 The court adopted the following framework for indicative default imprisonment terms (at [67]):Fine quantum imposed per chargeIndicative default sentenceUp to $500,000Up to 6 months$500,000 to $1m6 to 12 months$1m to $2m 12 to 24 months$2m to $3m24 to 36 months$3m to $5m36 to 48 months$5m to $10m48 to 72 months$10m and above72 months (statutory maximum)17 Having determined the indicative default imprisonment term for each charge, the sentencing court in cases involving multiple charges should then consider whether the aggregate default imprisonment term offends the totality principle, bearing in mind that s 319(1)(b)(v) of the CPC mandates that default imprisonment terms must run consecutively: at [68].The present appeal18 The present case was not sufficiently exceptional to warrant invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling. It was not the respondent’s position that there was an entrenched starting point or sentencing norm in relation to offences under s 128D of the Customs Act or the corresponding default imprisonment terms. The sentencing frameworks adopted by the court did not constitute a fundamental and unforeseeable change in the law. There was therefore no serious and demonstrable injustice occasioned by applying the frameworks to the present appeal: at [72].19 Applying the frameworks set out to the present appeal, the fines imposed by the DJ were not manifestly inadequate. There was also no reason to disagree with the DJ’s analysis of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. The court therefore affirmed the DJ’s decision on the fines imposed: at [74] and [75].20 As for the default imprisonment term, it followed from the framework set out by the court that the indicative default imprisonment term was 12 months for each charge, or 36 months for the three charges. The total default imprisonment term of 24 months imposed by the DJ was therefore manifestly inadequate: at [76].21 The High Court allowed the Prosecution’s appeal in part. The court ordered the fine of $1m for each charge imposed by the DJ to stand but increased the default imprisonment term to 12 months per charge (instead of eight months) or 36 months’ imprisonment in total: at [77].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
