As part of their services, they executed photo-shoots to take photographs of these hotels and resorts and edited these photographs: at [12]–[13].2 In 2013, the second plaintiff discovered that some of these photographs had appeared in the defendants’ in-house online magazine. Issues of this magazine were available for download from websites owned or operated by the defendants and distributed to hotels managed by the defendants and the hotel’s guests: at [16].3 The third plaintiff had previously commenced proceedings for copyright infringement against the second defendant (and other defendants) in the United States. The suit against the second defendant was dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens, and the proceedings against the other defendants were stayed pending the resolution of the proceedings in Singapore: at [17].The court’s ground of decision4 The copyright over the photographs belonged to the plaintiffs. Applying s 30(5) of the Copyright Act, the copyright in the raw photographs taken by the photographers was owned by the plaintiffs, who had commissioned the photographers to do so: at [44]. s 30(5) did not apply to vest ownership of the copyright in the Hotels, as the agreement between the plaintiffs and the hotels was not to commission the plaintiffs to take the photographs, but for the plaintiffs to operate as a one-stop shop to provide branding, design and marketing services for the hotels: at [50], [60].5 Even if the agreement between the plaintiffs and the hotels was for the taking of photographs, the operation of s 30(5) did not apply as per s 30(3) Copyright Act, it had been excluded by agreement between the parties. The Hotels had accepted that the plaintiffs had reserved copyright over the photographs by way of Reservation Clauses in the Production Estimates provided to the Hotels and to the defendants: at [51], [62], [67], [72], [79]–[81]. The parties’ conduct evinced that that members of the defendants’ senior management team had acknowledged that copyright lay with the plaintiffs: at [83]–[91].6 The present owner is the third plaintiff, by dint of a series of copyright assignments over the years: at [93]. By way of the 7 July 2013 Assignment, the third plaintiff had also been validly assigned the right to sue for past copyright infringements: at [101].7 There was no “implied term” as between Wave and the Hotels that the copyright in the photographs “shall be assigned to the owners” of the Hotels. Applying the test for implying terms into a contract from Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte and another [2013] 4 SLR 193, such an implied term would directly contradict the plaintiffs’ express reservation of copyright and hence fail the officious bystander test: at [107]. Further, the inclusion of the Reservation Clause in the Production Estimates suggests that the plaintiffs had no intention at the time of contracting to assign copyright ownership to the Hotels, and this implied term would hence also fail the business efficacy test: at [108]. There was also no necessity for such an implied term as it would not have been efficient for the Hotels and/or the defendants to liaise with multiple service providers: at [109].8 The defendants had never actually pleaded that there was an implied assignment of the copyright to the second defendant. Their omission to plead this proposition was fatal to their submission of an implied assignment of copyright: at [112]. Moreover, in the absence of any pleading regarding the existence of an express contract between the plaintiffs and defendants, there was no basis for the court to find that an implied assignment to the second defendant existed: at [113]–[115].9 The defendants’ alternative argument that the second defendant had an implied license from the Hotel owners to use the photographs also failed as in the agreement between the plaintiffs and the Hotels, the parties’ intention was for the plaintiffs to use the photographs in the marketing materials it produced, and not for them to be used by any other vendor: at [124].10 The second defendant had infringed upon the copyright over the photographs by doing the following. It had reproduced them in its in-house magazine with the plaintiffs’ licence or consent. It had communicated the photographs to the general public by making the magazine issues available for download on its website. It had also imported copies of the magazine into Singapore for the purpose of distribution for the purpose of trade, or by way of trade exhibiting it in public, when it knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of these publications was carried out without the licence and/or consent of the plaintiffs: at [151]–[154].11 Although the first defendant’s defence that it had nothing to do with the publishing of the magazine or the defendants’ website, the court found that the first defendant had, together with the second defendant, jointly published and/or produced the first six issues of the magazine: at [163]. There was evidence to demonstrate its involvement in the management of the hotels and the services provided by the plaintiffs to the hotels: at [156]. The imprint on the first six issues of the defendants’ magazine used two different appellations which clearly referred to two different entities, one of which was the first defendant: at [162]. The defendants’ failure to call as witness Mr Hans Jenni – a material witness to whom they attributed responsibility for publishing the magazine, led to an adverse inference being drawn against them, strengthening the plaintiffs’ evidence of the first defendant’s joint involvement in publishing the first six issues of the magazine: at [164]–[165].12 The defence of laches did not apply. There was no inordinate delay by the plaintiffs – the second plaintiff had found out about the copyright infringements only in December 2012, the proceedings in the US had been commenced in December 2013, and they had commenced the proceedings in Singapore in February 2018 after the US proceedings were dismissed in March 2017: at [184].13 The defence of acquiescence also did not apply. The defendants were not able to establish that the plaintiffs knew of the hotel photographs being used and did nothing to assert their copyright: at [186].14 The defence of estoppel by convention was similarly unsuccessful. Given that the second plaintiff was found to have been telling the truth when she testified to having discovered the copyright infringements only in December 2012, the plaintiffs could not have acquiesced to any assumption made by the second defendant prior to December 2012: at [189].15 The plaintiffs had locus standi to seek declaratory relief: at [196]. The court is not barred from granting a declaration intended to be used in foreign proceedings, and these declarations sought were not sought merely for use in the US proceedings. Neither was any intended use of the declarations in the US proceedings an invalid or improper purpose: at [203]–[204].16 Reading ss 119(2A) and 119(2B) of the Copyright Act together, the plaintiffs are not obliged to elect between remedies of damages to be assessed under s 119(2)(b) or an account of profits under s 119(2)(c): at [213]–[216].17 The plaintiffs’ offer to settle was a serious and genuine offer – it had an element of compromise present, had a legitimate basis and was not illusory, and the terms of the proposed consent judgment were not unreasonable: at [231]. The Offer to Settle was valid as it had no expiry date and had not been withdrawn, although it had since ceased to exist on account of the fact that all outstanding matters relating to liability had been disposed of: at [233]–[234]. The judgment was not less favourable than the terms of the Offer to Settle: at [235]. The cost consequences set out in O 22A r 9(1) Rules of Court were applicable: at [236].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
