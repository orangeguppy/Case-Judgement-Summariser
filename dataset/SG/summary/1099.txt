SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE8 December 2021Case summaryKiri Industries v Senda International Capital Ltd and another [2021] SGHC(I) 16SIC/S 4/2017----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of Kannan Ramesh J, Roger Giles IJ and Anselmo Reyes IJ:Outcome: SICC awarded costs of S$4,960,815.26 and disbursements of S$3,100,826.85 to Kiri, with interest of 5.33% per annum calculated from the date of the judgment. Background1 The judgment arose out of a long running litigation between Kiri Industries (“Kiri”), and Senda International Capital Ltd (“Senda”) over acts of oppression by Senda with regard to the parties’ joint venture vehicle, DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“DyStar”). Kiri filed Suit No 4 of 2017 in the High Court and numerous pre-trial matters were heard (“the Pre-Transfer Tranche”). The case was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“the SICC”), and the trial on liability was heard (“the Post-Transfer Liability Tranche”). Senda was ordered to buy-out Kiri’s minority interest in DyStar. By an oral judgment (“the Oral Judgment”), the Court ordered that costs from the date of filing, to the date that judgment was rendered for liability (“the Liability Tranche”), be agreed or taxed. After the Liability Tranche, there were several hearings on the valuation of Kiri’s minority interest (“the Valuation Tranche”), and eventually, the court determined this to be US$481.6m.Parties’ positions2 After the final judgment on valuation, parties made submissions on costs. (a) On the costs incurred in the Pre-Transfer Tranche (“Pre-Transfer Costs”), parties agreed that costs should be fixed with regard to Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (“Appendix G”). Kiri argued it was entitled to S$500,000, whilst Senda took the position that Kiri was only entitled to S$102,000. (b) On costs incurred post-transfer (“Post-Transfer Costs”), which included the costs of the Post-Transfer Liability Tranche (“Post-Transfer Liability Costs”) and the costs of the Valuation Tranche (“Valuation Costs”), Kiri sought S$7,297,718.50. Senda argued that the Post-Transfer Liability Costs should be assessed with regard to Appendix G and quantified at S$102,000. On the Valuation Costs, Senda argued that parties should bear their own costs, or that there should be a significant discount on the costs awarded to Kiri. In the latter situation, Senda argued that Kiri should be entitled to S$156,000. Kiri argued it was entitled to the full extent of the Valuation Costs. (c) On disbursements, Kiri sought S$5,944,073.44. Senda took issue with several of the items claimed by Kiri. (d) Senda also took issue with the mode of assessing costs and disbursements, arguing that they should be taxed by a registrar in accordance with O 59 r 20 of the ROC. This was on the basis of the costs order in the Oral Judgment. Kiri disagreed, arguing that costs were to be fixed by the court. The court’s decisionMode of assessment of costs in the SICC3 The court held that costs cannot be taxed in accordance with O 59 r 20 of the ROC, ie, by a registrar with a detailed Bill of Costs. This was because O 110 r 46(6) expressly excludes the operation of O 59, and further, taxation by a registrar would go against the purpose of the SICC. Instead, costs are to be assessed by the coram that heard the substantive issues of the case. The reference to costs being taxed in the Oral Judgment referred to costs being assessed by the coram in a more detailed manner: at [15]–[24].Entitlement to Valuation Costs4 The court found that Kiri was entitled to reasonable costs for the Valuation Tranche as it was successful in persuading the court that its minority interest in DyStar was valued at US$481.6m. However, a discount was to be applied: at [26].Quantum of Pre-Transfer Costs 5 The default position is that Appendix G applies to the assessment of Pre-Transfer Costs unless there is a “compelling justification” for departing from it. In this case, there was no such justification, and thus Appendix G was the starting point for assessment. However, the court was of the view that there should be an uplift from the scale in Appendix G to reflect the complexity of the matter: at [34], [38]–[39], [41] and [43].6 The court assessed Pre-Transfer Costs by assessing the costs of the Liability Tranche as a whole as if it had been conducted entirely in the High Court, with reference to Appendix G. First, the court ascribed a daily tariff of S$35,000 due to the complexity of the matter. Second, the percentage reduction found in Appendix G did not apply due to the enormity of the litigation. Thus, multiplying the tariff by the 12 days of trial, this gave a figure of S$420,000. This figure was to be apportioned based on the hours spent by Kiri’s lawyers in the Pre-Transfer Tranche and Post-Transfer Liability Tranche. The time spent in the Pre-Transfer Tranche represented 27.29% of the total time spent in the Liability Tranche. Applying this figure to S$420,000, the court awarded Pre-Transfer Costs of S$114,636.90: at [43], [46], [48]–[51]. Quantum of Post-Transfer Costs7 The court rejected Senda’s position that the Post-Transfer costs should be assessed with primary reference to Appendix G due to the length, complexity and enormity of the matter: at [54] and [58].8 Under O 110 r 46(1) of the ROC, “reasonable costs” allows the court to look at all the facts and circumstances of a given case and determine the appropriate quantum of costs to be awarded. Based on a statutory interpretation, “reasonable costs” in the SICC will be generally higher than in the High Court. In the High Court, only a “reasonable amount” of the reasonably incurred costs may be awarded, ie, there was a double attenuation of costs based on the concept of reasonableness. However, this concept of double attenuation does not appear in O 110 r 46, which may lead to the interpretation that costs in the SICC will be higher. This was supported by the fact that in the SICC, the policy concern of “access to justice”, which is present in the High Court, is replaced by the commercial consideration of ensuring that a successful litigant is not out of pocket for prosecuting its claim. However, a litigant in the SICC would not be awarded costs that were not properly or sensibly incurred: at [66], [72]–[73], [77]–[80].9 A general approach to assess “reasonable costs” is to take: (a) the time spent on the matter; and multiply it by (b) an appropriate hourly tariff. The reasonableness of both figures can be assessed with reference to the factors set out in paragraph 152(3)(a) of the SICC Practice Directions. This may then be weighed against the overarching consideration of proportionality, which requires that the costs incurred not be disproportionate to the value of the claim: at [81]–[82].10 The Post-Transfer Liability Costs and the Valuation Costs were to be assessed together, ie, as the Post Transfer Costs. This was because both sets of costs were incurred with the overall objective of obtaining relief from oppression by a buy-out at a determined value, and the issues in both the Liability Tranche and Valuation Tranche substantially overlapped, ie, bifurcation was a matter of case management that did not substantively change the nature of the dispute. Thus, whilst Kiri was entitled to the full costs of the Post-Transfer Liability Tranche, the full extent of the “reasonable costs” had to be assessed with regard to the value of the claim and Kiri’s success in obtaining this value: at [84], [85], [87].11 The extent of Kiri’s success was assessed by examining which issues it had not reasonably pursued. The only issue that was not properly pursued was Kiri’s claim for an Account of Profits. The lack of success on this issue could be quantified by taking the difference between Kiri’s valuation that included the Account of Profits, and its valuation that did not include the Account of Profits. This difference represented 30.41% of Kiri’s valuation that included the Account of Profits. This figure was to be applied as a reduction to the costs claimed by Kiri: at [88], [90], [93].12 However, there were certain parcels of costs that had to be deducted from Kiri’s claim. This was not due to a lack of success or that the costs were not improperly pursued. Rather, it was because these parcels of costs might rightly be claimed in other proceedings or had already been claimed, ie, there was a risk of double recovery. This resulted in a sum of S$6,963,900.50: at [95]. 13 Reducing the sum of S$6,963,900.50 by 30.41%, the total amount of Post-Transfer Costs awarded to Kiri was S$4,846,178.36: at [96].Disbursements14 Kiri was entitled to only S$3,100,826.85 of its claimed disbursements, as several items were challenged by Senda: (a) Kiri’s claim for foreign lawyer fees was not allowed as there was no reason for the involvement of foreign counsel, and it was unclear what value Kiri’s foreign lawyers added to the litigation: at [100]–[101].(b) Kiri’s claim for its valuation expert’s fees was allowed in part, and was subject to a reduction of 30.41% as its claim for Account of Profits was not sensible: at [104]–[105].(c) Kiri’s claims for two other sets of expert fees, those of CDIC Consultants (“CDIC”) and Dr Girishbhai Tandel (“Dr Tandel”) was not allowed as the evidence from CDIC was not used, and Dr Tandel gave evidence in support of the Account of Profits claim which was not sensibly pursued: at [107]–[109].(d) Kiri’s claim for travel expenses was allowed in part. The court allowed Kiri’s claim for travel expenses of witnesses and for travel to Singapore to attend meetings with counsel. However, the court did not allow travel expenses in relation to its foreign lawyers, or Dr Tandel: at [110], [114]–[115].Interest on costs 15 The court awarded post-judgment interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum, and this was to run from the date of the judgment: at [119].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
