SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE7 July 2022Case summaryPublic Prosecutor v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 157General Division of the High Court – Magistrate’s Appeal No 9066 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the General Division of the High Court (delivered by Steven Chong JA):Outcome: HC adopts a sentencing framework for s 12(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and raises the respondent’s fine to $250,000. Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The appropriate sentencing framework for offences under s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) has two stages. In the first stage of the framework, the sentencing judge is to determine the level of harm and the level of culpability, in order to derive the indicative starting point according to the following benchmarks:CulpabilityLowModerateHighHarmHigh$150,000 to $225,000$225,000 to $300,000$300,000 to $500,000Moderate$75,000 to $150,000$150,000 to $225,000$225,000 to $300,000LowUp to $75,000$75,000 to $150,000$150,000 to $225,000In the second stage of the framework, the starting sentence should be calibrated according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors: at [28].Background to the application and material facts 1 A worker was struck by the suspended jib of a tower crane being erected on a vessel at a shipyard. The jib had not been rigged according to the manufacturer’s configuration. Unfortunately, the worker passed away as a result of his injuries.2 Consequently, the respondent company, which was the employer of the deceased, was charged with, pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of a charge under s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Act. The District Judge, applying the sentencing frameworks set out in Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp [2017] 3 SLR 682 (“GS Engineering”) and MW Group Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor [2019] 3 SLR 1300 (“MW Group”), sentenced the respondent to a $220,000 fine.3 The Prosecution appealed against the decision of the District Judge. It argued that a framework based on that set out in Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor [2020] 5 SLR 580 (“Mao Xuezhong”) – which related to offences under s 15(3A) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) – was more appropriate. It also submitted that this framework should be applicable not just to offences under s 12(1) of the Act, but generally to all other offences set out in Part 4 of the Act and punishable under s 50(b) of the Act.DecisionThe appropriate sentencing framework for s 12(1) of the Act4 The sentencing frameworks in GS Engineering and MW Group both derived indicative starting point sentences from the potential harm caused by the offence and the culpability of the offender, with more weight accorded to potential harm than to culpability. However, there was a disparity between the sentencing benchmarks set out in GS Engineering and MW Group. This was liable to result in difficulties for lower courts seeking guidance from the High Court, leading to uncertainty and inconsistency in sentencing. This is antithetical to the objective of sentencing guidelines: at [14], [16] and [18].5 On the other hand, the sentencing framework in Mao Xuezhong derived indicative starting point sentences with equal consideration being given to harm and culpability, with the conception of harm encompassing both potential and actual harm: at [21].6 The principles underlying Mao Xuezhong should apply to s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Act as well. A better understanding of the Act indicated that potential harm was not to be accorded precedence over other factors, and that the Act was meant to give effect to a more nuanced notion of harm. The proper approach was therefore to evaluate harm as a whole, including both the potential harm and the actual harm. Where actual harm has occurred, it is artificial to relegate it to a secondary concern, rather than treating it as one of the primary factors in determining the indicative starting sentence for an offender. Further, in relation to s 12(1) offences, harm and culpability were equally important considerations: at [22] to [25] and [27].7 Therefore, the appropriate sentencing framework, inclusive of benchmarks for indicative starting sentences (the “Framework”), for offences under s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Act was as follows. In the first stage of the framework, the sentencing judge was to determine the level of harm and the level of culpability, in order to derive the indicative starting point according to the following benchmarks:CulpabilityLowModerateHighHarmHigh$150,000 to $225,000$225,000 to $300,000$300,000 to $500,000Moderate$75,000 to $150,000$150,000 to $225,000$225,000 to $300,000LowUp to $75,000$75,000 to $150,000$150,000 to $225,000In the second stage of the framework, the starting sentence should be calibrated according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors: at [28].Whether the Framework should apply to other Part 4 offences8 Provisionally, the same two-stage sentencing approach should in principle apply to all Part 4 offences punishable under s 50 of the Act. In addition, where the offender is a body corporate and punishable under s 50(b), the same benchmarks should apply. Appropriate benchmarks for natural persons punishable under s 50(a) and for offences for which punishments are otherwise specified in the Act may be considered and developed in future cases: at [39].Whether the doctrine of prospective overruling should apply9 Contrary to the respondent’s contention, the doctrine of prospective overruling was not applicable. The respondent had not demonstrated a case of injustice. GS Engineering and MW Group were both relatively recent decisions, and the mere application of the sentencing frameworks therein in the courts below did not render them entrenched. The Framework was largely based on principles similar to those set out in Mao Xuezhong, and the departure from GS Engineering and MW Group is more akin to a recalibration than a seismic change. This recalibration would also have been reasonably foreseeable: Mao Xuezhong was decided in May 2020 and the respondent pleaded guilty in January 2021. There was also no apparent element of reliance: at [42].The appropriate sentence10 There was no reason to depart from the District Judge’s findings that the respondent’s offence involved moderate culpability and high potential harm. The death of the worker, which the District Judge had identified as an aggravating factor, was to be accounted for in the consideration of harm at the first stage of the Framework. There was also no reason to depart from the mitigating factors identified by the District Judge. Applying the Framework, a fine of $250,000 was appropriate: at [43] to [47].11 The Prosecution’s appeal against the sentence meted out by the District Judge was therefore allowed, and the fine imposed by the District Judge of $220,000 was substituted with a fine of $250,000: at [49].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision. It is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the Court. All numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the Court’s grounds of decision.
