Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor
Criminal
Appeal No 32 of 2016




Decision
of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA)
Background to the appeal 
1                   
The appellant was convicted by
a High Court judge (“Judge”) of two charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008
Rev Ed), one for rape under s 375(1)(a)
and one for sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) for having penetrated the victim’s vagina with his finger. The
trial judge sentenced him to 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane
for each charge. The imprisonment terms were reduced to 11 years and 19 days
for each offence to
take into account the time that the appellant had spent in remand before being
released on bail. With both sentences ordered to run concurrently, the
appellant’s aggregate sentence was 11 years and 19 days’ imprisonment and 12
strokes of the cane. The appellant filed an appeal challenging both his
conviction and the sentences imposed on him. 
Facts
2                   
The
material events occurred over a short span of about four hours, between 11pm on
5 May 2012 and 2:50am on 6 May 2012. The victim, [V], was 20 years of age at that
time and was employed as a contract teacher. She went with a friend, [S], to a
party at the Wavehouse, a club at Siloso Beach, Sentosa. The party was to
promote Cointreau, a brand of orange-flavoured liqueur. 
3                   
At
the bar counter of the Wavehouse, [V] and [S] met the appellant, a part-time
beach patrol officer who had attended the party after finishing his shift. There
was plenty of drinking. On one occasion, [V] had Cointreau poured into her
mouth for some 20 seconds straight by the appellant because it had come to
light that she had turned 20 the week before. Also at the bar counter was [J], a
part-time event promoter who was working at the party at the Wavehouse that
night and who had been asked to attend to [V] and [S].  
4                   
At
one point in time, [V] left the bar counter for the VIP area in the Wavehouse
because [J] had asked her to go there with him. She then went back to the bar counter
area to rejoin [S] and the appellant. Later, [V] danced on the dance floor with
[J]. At some point, while she was dancing, [V] realised she was too drunk and
wanted to go home. She recalled trying to look for [S]. 
5                   
[S]
said that she called [V] and [V] told her that she was in the VIP area. [S]
went with the appellant to the VIP area. The appellant found [V]. [S] then met
up with both of them at the intersection between the bar and the VIP area. [S]
said that the appellant then asked her to get [V]’s bag from the VIP area. When
she returned, the appellant and [V] were no longer there. [V] and the appellant
had left the club by themselves and headed for the beach. 
6                   
What
happened after that was the central dispute in this case. [V] said that by this
time, she was intoxicated to the point of being barely conscious, and that the
appellant had penetrated her with his finger and also raped her while they were
on the beach. The appellant asserted that [V] was not as intoxicated as she
claims to have been, and that the sexual activity between them, which included
some foreplay, was consensual.
7                   
On realising [V] had gone missing, [S] spent about 20 minutes looking for
her. She called [V] on her handphone a few times. One time, the appellant
answered and told her that he and [V] were on the beach; he told [S] to remain
at the Wavehouse and that he would look for her. [S] went to look for [V] on
the beach nonetheless. [S] found the appellant and [V] on the beach. [S] tried
talking to [V] but the latter was not responding clearly. She saw [V] foaming
at the mouth and, in a state of panic, she called the Singapore Civil Defence
Force to request an ambulance. That was at 2:50am. 
8                   
Two
partygoers named Kason and Terence, who were friends and had gone to the
Wavehouse that night, roughly saw what happened between the appellant and [V]
on the beach. At about 2am, Kason was walking along the beach looking for a
friend’s lost slippers. He saw the appellant, his bare buttocks facing him,
kneeling down and bending over [V]. Kason thought the appellant and [V] were a
couple making out and ignored them. Kason passed them a second time when he
passed by the same location later. He saw the appellant kneeling in between
[V]’s legs. Kason met up with Terence and told him what he had seen. Terence
went to have a look for himself. He saw that there was little movement from
[V]. Terence told Kason that what he had seen was not right. Kason went back
for a third look and saw that [V] was naked and trying to push the appellant
away with the use of one hand. Kason called the police at 2:25am. 
9                   
Following
Kason’s police report, officers from the Singapore Police Force arrived at the
scene at 2:53am. The appellant was placed under arrest at 6:20am on 6 May 2012.

Court’s decision 
The appeal against conviction
10               
For
the offence of rape under s 375 of the Penal Code, the Public Prosecutor (“PP”)
bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the appellant had
penetrated the vagina of [V] with his penis; and (b) this was without her
consent. The Judge found that the PP had proven both these elements of the
offence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
11               
The appellant made three
arguments on appeal. First, although the appellant did not challenge the Judge’s finding that
he had penetrated [V]’s vagina with both his penis and his finger, he argued
that the Judge’s finding that [V] did not consent was inconsistent with the
material evidence on record.
12               
The
Court of Appeal rejected this argument. The evidence relied on by the appellant
did not assist him. The evidence relating to the interaction between the
appellant and [V] at the bar counter was only remotely relevant to determining
whether [V] had decided to engage in consensual sexual activity on the beach
with the appellant in spite of her being fairly intoxicated ([72]). The fact that there was no
evidence of what happened between 1am and 2am apart from the appellant’s and
[V]’s account of events did not mean that [V] and the appellant must have been
engaging in consensual foreplay. This was but a speculation which became less
tenable once one factored in [V]’s level of intoxication ([79]). The medical evidence showing an absence of a fresh tear on
[V]’s vagina was a neutral factor given that [V] was intoxicated to the point
where she was verging on unconsciousness and could not put up any resistance ([89]). 
13               
The appellant’s second argument
related to the Judge’s finding that even if the appellant had asked [V] whether
she wanted to have sex, and even if [V] had said yes, her response would have
been vitiated by s 90(b) of the Penal
Code. Section 90(b) says that consent
given by a person who, from intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of
that to which he gives his consent, is not valid consent. The appellant argued
the Judge was wrong to have found that [V] was incapable of giving consent due
to her intoxication. 
14               
The
Court rejected this argument. The evidence as to [V]’s mental state immediately
before, during and immediately after the time she was with the appellant at the
beach suggested that she was in no capacity to consent to penile or digital
penetration. She was too intoxicated to understand the nature and consequences
of giving consent. She could not have consented to either act of penetration by
the appellant ([108]). 
15               
The
appellant’s third argument related to the Judge’s rejection of the appellant’s
reliance on the defence of mistake of fact in s 79 of the Penal Code. Section
79 says that nothing is an offence if done by a person who, by reason of a
mistake of fact, in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in doing
it. According to s 52 of the Penal Code, nothing is believed “in good faith” if
it is believed “without due care and attention” [110]. 
16               
The
Court was not persuaded that, even if the appellant believed, mistakenly, that
[V] was consenting to penile and digital penetration, he had arrived at this
belief after having exercised due care and attention ([114]). 
17               
In
the circumstances, the Court affirmed the Judge’s conviction of the appellant
on both charges ([116]). 
The appeal against sentence
18               
The Judge made his decision on
sentence based on the sentencing framework propounded in Public Prosecutor v NF [2006] 4 SLR(R) 849. That framework was revised in a recent decision of
the Court, Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“Terence Ng”), which was issued on 12 May
2017, after the Court had heard this appeal (on 11 April 2017). Accordingly, in
anticipation that the revised framework in Terence
Ng could be relevant if the Court were to affirm the conviction recorded by
the Judge against the appellant, the Court invited parties to make specific
submissions on how the new framework would impact the sentences in this case ([118]). The parties did so on 27 June
2017. 
19               
Terence Ng set out three sentencing bands for
rape ([121]). Rape falls within Band
1 if there are no offence-specific aggravating factors or if they are present
only to a very limited extent; it falls within Band 2 if there are two or more
offence-specific aggravating factors ([122]).
The appellant argued that the present case fell within Band 1 because there was
no offence-specific aggravating factor ([123]).
The PP argued that the present case fell within Band 2 because there were two
offence-specific aggravating factors, namely the vulnerability of [V] due to
her intoxication and the fact that the appellant had acted with premeditation
([124]). 
20               
The Court found that there was
only one offence-specific aggravating factor here: the vulnerability of the
victim. [V] was
severely intoxicated and had no control over even basic motor movements. She
was a vulnerable victim and the appellant exploited that to his advantage ([132]). However, the Court did not think
the appellant’s acts were premeditated; rather, his moves were hatched on the
spur of the moment ([138]). Since
the presence of one offence-specific aggravating factor would place a case
within the middle to upper range of Band 1 ([139]), the indicative sentence here would be 12 or 13 years’
imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Given that range, the Judge’s sentence
of 12 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the rape charge was not
manifestly excessive ([140]). 
21               
As for the offence of sexual
assault by digital penetration, the Court disagreed with the PP’s submission
that the same sentencing bands for rape as set out in Terence Ng should apply. Among other reasons, this was because, in
the Court’s view, there is an intelligible difference between penile
penetration of the vagina and digital penetration of it. First, penile penetration carries the risk
of unwanted pregnancy and of transmitting sexual diseases which would have
far-reaching consequences for the victim. Second, penile penetration is a more
intimate act than digital penetration; the abuse of such an act therefore
represents a greater degree of intrusion into the sexual autonomy of the victim
and a greater degree of exploitation by the offender of the victim ([150]). 
22               
Nonetheless,
the Court recognised the logic of the PP’s submission that the Terence Ng framework should be
transposed to the offence of digital penetration, because many of the
offence-specific aggravating factors for rape may also be present and pertinent
in offences involving digital penetration ([158]). However, the range of starting sentence for each band should
be lower to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence ([159]). The Court therefore held that the sentencing bands should be
as follows: 
(a)               
Band
1: 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane; 
(b)              
Band
2: 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane; 
(c)               
Band
3: 15 to  20 years’ imprisonment and 12
strokes of the cane.
23               Applying
these sentencing bands to the present appeal, the Court found that the
appellant’s sentence for the digital penetration charge was too high and should
be reduced. The indicative starting sentence was also in the middle to upper
range of Band 1 given the presence of the one offence-specific aggravating
factor, which is that the appellant exploited the vulnerability of [V], who was
intoxicated. That gave an indicative sentence of either 8 to 9 years’
imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane ([172]).
The Court found that an appropriate sentence would be 8 years and six months’ imprisonment
and 4 strokes of the cane. After taking into account the period of remand, the
sentence was reduced to 7 years six months and 19 days’ imprisonment and 4
strokes of the cane ([173]).
24               
In
the premises, the appeal against conviction was dismissed ([174]) and the appeal against sentence was
allowed only in respect of the sentence for the digital penetration offence. The result, therefore, was that the total imprisonment term remained
at 11 years and 19 days and the total number of strokes of caning was reduced
from 12 to 10 ([175]).
