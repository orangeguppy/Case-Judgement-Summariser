Case summary
UJN v UJO [2021] SGCA 39
Civil Appeal No 172 of 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Woo Bih Li):
Outcome: The CoA allows an appeal against the division of matrimonial assets in part but upholds the judge’s decision below to draw an adverse inference against the husband for non-disclosure.
 
Background to the appeal
1 This appeal concerned the division of matrimonial assets. In the proceedings below, the judge drew an adverse inference against the husband for failing to disclose all his assets. The judge accounted for the husband’s non-disclosure by applying an uplift of 5% to the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets.
2 The husband appealed against the following findings made by the judge:
 	(a) that the husband had not accounted for his bonuses and awards from Company [J] totalling US$1,870,000;
 (b) that the husband’s assets included half the value of a property in New York and of a property in London, both of which he jointly owned with one [MC];
 (c) that the husband had not properly accounted for US$2.3m worth of shares in Company [D];
 (d) that the balance sum of $367,599.68 in a trading account with [H] was distinct from the sale proceeds of the said US$2.3m worth of shares in Company [D]; and 
 (e) that the value of a property located at Loyang was $6m as at 5 October 2016, the date of the interim judgment (“IJ”).
 
The Court of Appeal’s decision
3 The Court of Appeal found that the husband had accounted for the aggregate sum of US$1,870,000 (comprising US$1.5m in bonus payments and US$370,000 in deferred awards) from Company [J] (at [3] and [9]). The fresh evidence adduced by the husband showed that a sum comprising his bonus payment of US$1,165,000 had been deposited into the parties’ joint account and that he had forfeited a sum of US$335,000 when he left Company [J] (at [5]). The wife would also have been aware that the husband had deposited his bonus into their joint account (at [7]).
4 Although the fresh evidence only specifically accounted for US$1.5m, it also supported the husband’s assertion that his salary and bonuses had previously always been paid into the parties’ joint account. It was therefore logical to deduce that the deferred award of US$370,000 had also been credited into the joint account (at [6]). Accordingly, the Court of Appeal ordered that the sum of US$1,870,000 be deducted from the matrimonial pool (at [9] and [34(a)]).
5 The Court of Appeal rejected the husband’s bare allegation that he was entitled to only 50% of the capital appreciation of the New York and London properties rather than 50% of the value of those properties (at [11]). The Court of Appeal affirmed the judge’s finding that the husband had failed to disclose the full value of the London property and the rental proceeds from both the New York and London properties (at [11], [12] and [14]). This omission ought to be considered in deciding whether to apply an uplift to the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets, as the judge had done (at [14]).
6 Under the husband’s employment contract, he was supposed to have received US$2.3m worth of restricted shares from Company [D] by October 2015 (at [15]). The judge was justified in finding that the husband had not accounted for those shares (at [16]).
7 The husband was inconsistent as to the date of award of the shares and the number of shares awarded (at [17] and [23]). Although he claimed that the shares had been awarded to him late, this claim was made belatedly and was unsupported by documentary evidence (at [16] and [18]). Crucially, the husband had omitted to produce written evidence from Company [D] to confirm the number of shares awarded to him, the date of award and the value ascribed to each share (at [19]). 
8 The husband tendered statements of account to show that his account with the Central Depository (Pte) Limited (“CDP”) had been credited with 1,444,558 shares in March 2016 and another 1,444,558 shares in August 2016. He claimed that these were the shares awarded to him by Company [D] (at [16]). However, he was granted the second tranche of 1,444,558 shares in August 2016 upon subscribing for the rights in a rights issue. The rights issue would have been granted to him in his capacity as a shareholder and not as an employee (at [22]). That also tainted the credibility of his explanation that the first tranche of 1,444,558 shares was awarded to him in his capacity as an employee pursuant to his employment contract (at [22]).  
9 The husband’s initial explanation that he had sold the 2,889,116 shares at US$0.04 per share also turned out to be inconsistent with his own case (at [24]).
10 The credit balance of $367,599.68 in the husband’s trading account with [H] was disclosed late and had not been included as part of his assets (at [27]). The judge was therefore entitled to include that sum as part of the husband’s assets (at [27]).
11 The Loyang property was a detached house with a land area of about 6,113 sq ft (at [30]). Although the judge had valued the Loyang property at $6m, the sale prices of detached houses in the area that were sold at around the date of the IJ and that were of larger land areas (like the Loyang property) supported a valuation of between $4.5m and $5m (at [30] and [31]). In the circumstances, the husband’s initial valuation of $5m was a fair value (at [32]). 
12 The Court of Appeal thus varied the judge’s decision by deducting US$1,870,000 from the matrimonial pool and ascribing a value of $5m to the Loyang property (at [9], [32] and [34]). However, the Court of Appeal concluded that the judge was justified in drawing an adverse inference against the husband for failing to disclose all his assets and in giving effect to that adverse inference by applying an uplift of 5% to the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets (at [33]).
