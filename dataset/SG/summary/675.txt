SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE3 October 2022Case summarySer Kim Koi v GTMS Construction Pte Ltd and others and another appeal [2022] SGHC(A) 34Appellate Division of the High Court – Civil Appeals Nos 20 and 36 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court (delivered by Judge of the Appellate Division Quentin Loh):Outcome: Appellate Division partially allows appeal against decision that owner could not claim liquidated damages from contractor in the absence of a Delay CertificatePertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The requirement by SP PowerGrid Ltd (“SPPG”) for an overground distribution box (“OG Box”) did not constitute a “force majeure” event within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the Singapore Institute of Architects, Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) (9th Ed, September 2010) (the “SIA Conditions”), but it did fall within a “statutory obligation” covered by cl 7 and cll 23(1)(f) and/or (o) of the SIA Conditions: at [82] to [83], [92], [94] to [95], [97].•  Although the architect in this case had not issued a Delay Certificate, liquidated damages could still be imposed on the contractor. Clauses 37(3) and 37(4) of the SIA Conditions empowered a court or an arbitral tribunal seised with the power to finally resolve all disputes between the parties to disregard the absence of a Delay Certificate. The court or arbitral tribunal was entitled to find and hold that the architect should or ought to have issued the Delay Certificate, and the court could also decide when the delay ended in the absence of a Termination of Delay Certificate: at [308], [324], [329(b)], [330] to [332].•  However, the owner’s claim against the architect for the liquidated damages he had failed to recover from the contractor pursuant to cl 24(2) of the SIA Conditions was dismissed. A claim for liquidated damages was separate in nature and quite different from a claim against an architect for breach of contract or tort for not issuing a Delay Certificate: at [351], [354] to [355].Background and material facts1 This case concerned a dispute between Mr Ser Kim Koi (“Mr Ser”), the owner of No. 12, No. 12A and No. 12B Leedon Park (collectively, the “Project”), his building contractor, GTMS Construction Pte Ltd (“GTMS”), as well as his architect, Mr Chan Sau Yan (“Mr Chan”). Mr Chan practised under a sole proprietorship, Chan Sau Yan Associates (“CSYA”). In October 2011, Mr Chan incorporated CSYA Pte Ltd and thereafter carried out his practice thereunder.2 Mr Ser engaged Mr Chan as his architect under a memorandum of agreement dated 16 June 2009 and subsequently engaged GTMS, on the SIA Conditions, to construct the three bungalows (the “Works”).3 The original completion date for the Works was 21 February 2013. Over the course of the Works, GTMS made three requests for extensions of time (“EOT”). The relevant extensions were the second and third EOTs (“EOT 2” and “EOT 3”, respectively). GTMS requested EOT 2 on 20 December 2012 due to, among other things, a delay by SPPG in connecting the main incoming power supply and SPPG’s late notice of the requirement to install an OG Box. Mr Chan granted EOT 2 on 7 February 2013 for a period of 40 days from 21 February 2013 to 2 April 2013. GTMS subsequently requested EOT 3 on 1 April 2013 to complete the testing and commissioning for M&E works and the installation of light fittings for the Project. Mr Chan granted EOT 3 on 10 April 2013 for a period of 15 days, extending the previous completion date further from 2 April 2013 to 17 April 2013.4 On 30 April 2013, the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) inspected the Project for the issuance of Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) (the “First TOP Inspection”). The Project failed the First TOP Inspection. On 15 May 2013, Mr Chan issued the Completion Certificate (the “CC”) certifying completion of the Project as of 17 April 2013, with a Schedule listing outstanding minor works. A second TOP inspection for the Project (the “Second TOP Inspection”) was conducted on 18 June 2013. The Project failed the Second TOP Inspection. On 16 September 2013, the Project obtained TOP. The Certificate of Statutory Completion was issued on 12 May 2014. On 7 July 2014, Mr Chan issued the Maintenance Certificate (the “MC”). The Project was handed over to Mr Ser on 21 and 23 July 2014. On 22 June 2015, Mr Chan issued the Final Certificate (“FC”) for some $450,000, and the second moiety of retention money was released under the FC. It should be noted that over the course of the Works, Mr Chan issued a total of 26 interim payment certificates. Mr Ser made payment for the first 24 interim payments, but not for Interim Payment Certificates 25 and 26 (“IC 25” and “IC 26” respectively).5 GTMS applied for summary judgment against Mr Ser on the basis of IC 25 and IC 26. While GTMS prevailed before the High Court, on appeal, the Court of Appeal (the “CA”) set aside the summary judgment. The CA found that neither IC 25 nor IC 26 had temporary finality, and Mr Chan had issued the CC, IC 25 and IC 26 improperly, without belief in their truth and/or recklessly, without caring whether they were true or false. Further, the CA found that the CC, IC 25 and IC 26 were not properly issued under the SIA Conditions.6 The dispute then went back before the High Court for trial (the “Suit”). GTMS claimed unpaid sums from Mr Ser arising from IC 25 and IC 26 and the final payment claim certified by Mr Chan. Mr Ser, in counterclaim, alleged that GTMS and Mr Chan had entered into an unlawful means conspiracy against him. Mr Chan counterclaimed against Mr Ser for unpaid architect’s fees. The High Court judge (the “Judge”) allowed GTMS’s and Mr Chan’s claims, but dismissed the bulk of Mr Ser’s claims. Thereafter, the Judge issued a supplemental judgment on costs in which he ordered, among other things, for Mr Ser to pay part of the costs of the action to GTMS and Mr Chan on an indemnity basis. Mr Ser appealed against the Judge’s decision to dismiss the bulk of his claims as well as the Judge’s decision on costs.The court’s decisionIssue 1: Whether EOT 2 and EOT 3 were properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS7 EOT 2 and EOT 3 were validly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS pursuant to cll 23(1)(f) and/or (o) of the SIA Conditions: at [114].8 The court did not agree with the Judge’s conclusion that SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box constituted a “force majeure” event within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions. SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box did not amount to such a radical or external event that was beyond the contemplation or control of the parties or something unforeseen to occur during the performance of the contract: at [82] to [83].9 However, SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box fell within a “statutory obligation” covered by cl 7 and cll 23(1)(f) and/or (o) of the SIA Conditions. SPPG was the “statutory undertaker” (by devolution) which had the power to oversee and operate the power grid in Singapore and to impose conditions or its requirements on the supply of electricity: at [92], [94] to [95], [97].  10 The requirement for an OG Box fell within the meaning of a “variation” to the Works, even if SPPG was the one constructing it. On the facts, there was no need for any architect’s instruction (“AI”) or verbal instructions or directions from Mr Chan to GTMS; the requirement for an OG Box was conveyed by SPPG to Mr Ser, who conveyed the same to his mechanical and engineering consultant (“CCA”). CCA then forwarded SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box to GTMS and CSYA: at [102] to [103].  11 The other requirements for an EOT under cl 23(1) of the SIA Conditions for an EOT were fulfilled. SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box did in fact cause a delay in connecting the power mains to the bungalows which in turn delayed the testing and commissioning of the mechanical and electrical Work and light fittings. Further, GTMS had acted with due diligence and had taken all reasonable steps to avoid or reduce the delay in completion. Although the Master Programme recorded GTMS’ plans to commence the SPPG power connection works on 9 July 2012, GTMS was not strictly contractually obliged to do so and its failure could not be conclusive of a lack of due diligence. The OG Box requirement was beyond the control of the parties and had occurred without the parties’ fault: at [105], [109], [113].Issue 2: Whether the CC was properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS12 Mr Chan had improperly (and prematurely) issued the CC on 15 May 2013, certifying completion as of 17 April 2013. In the absence of any other evidence, the earliest that the CC could have been issued was on 16 September 2013, ie, the date that the TOP was issued: at [270].13 The Preliminaries were incorporated into the Contract. The parties’ conduct from the time of contracting in May 2011 to the time the disputes arose towards the end of 2013 all pointed to the parties’ acceptance of a binding contract: at [119] to [120], [122].Item 72(a)14 Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries stated that the CC shall not be issued until “[a]ll parts of the Works are in the Architect’s opinion ready for occupation and for use”. In the court’s view, Item 72(a) meant that the Works could not be occupied and used as a dwelling before obtaining the TOP. Therefore, Mr Chan was not entitled to issue the CC on 15 May 2013 certifying contract completion as of 17 April 2013 before the grant of TOP. The court proceeded on the basis that the CC ought to have been issued on 16 September 2013, that being the earliest date when it could have been issued: at [124], [138], [143].15 Because of the delay in obtaining TOP and the consequent delay that would have on the issue of the CC, it was necessary to examine, for the purposes of liability, who was responsible for the delays. Unfortunately, some of the Judge’s analysis and findings of fact in relation to the various items causing the bungalows to fail the TOP Inspections and attributions of fault therefor were, with respect, not entirely clear nor, in some important instances, adequate to determine liability. The facts before the court raised the issue of concurrent delays when the architect issued instructions or required additional works during a period of delay caused by the contractor. However, this issue was not raised in the pleadings and was only very briefly mentioned in parties’ submissions to the Judge. The parties should have pleaded and made submissions on, among other things, whether a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) of the SIA Conditions should have been issued certifying delays in completion of the works as from 18 April 2013, the reasons for the failure of the First and Second TOP Inspection, and the effect, if any, of the above mentioned certificates on the liquidated damages accumulating against GTMS: at [144], [162], [170], [172].16 Despite the foregoing analysis of how the dispute should have been resolved, the court was constrained by the way the parties ran their respective cases below, and as a result thereof, to accept the Judge’s limited findings of fact. As found by the Judge, GTMS completed remedying their construction errors by 28 May 2013 and therefore liquidated damages against GTMS would run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. The court found that on the facts, the liability for the delays after 28 May 2013 in obtaining the TOP were attributable to Mr Chan’s errors and omissions. Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate on or as reasonably soon after 18 April 2013 as GTMS was in delay as of that date and liquidated damages ran from that date. Next, Mr Chan should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) of the SIA Conditions on or as soon as possible after 29 May 2013 such that, under cl 24(3)(b), liquidated damages should then have stopped running against GTMS. Liquidated damages against GTMS would therefore run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013; this would amount to $147,600: at [174] to [175].Item 72(b)17 Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries stated that the CC shall not be issued until “[a]ll services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily as specified in the Contract … including handing over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties”. The Judge was of the view that Item 72(b) was satisfied by 17 April 2013 and the court did not consider that there was sufficient basis to disturb the Judge’s findings on Item 72(b): at [177], [179], [182], [184], [187] to [188], [193] to [194].18 However, the court did not agree with the Judge’s de minimis approach to the requirement to hand over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties in Item 72(b). On a true construction, Item 72(b) required the handing over of all test certificates (unless waived or modified by agreement of the parties), operating instructions and warranties before the issue of the CC. However, the court agreed with the Judge that these documents were in fact ready earlier than 22 June 2014 (the date they were handed over), but Mr Ser refused to take over the Project soon after TOP. Thus, Mr Ser was in no position to contend that this requirement was not complied with: at [197].Item 72(c)19 Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries required that the CC be issued only when the works under the Contract, including any rectifications, were done “to the completion and standards acceptable to [Mr Chan]”. In this regard, the Judge accepted that there were some defects with the bungalows, but found that they did not affect the date on which the Works could be deemed as completed for the purposes of the CC. The court found that Mr Ser’s complaints regarding the defects in the bungalows were without merit, save for that relating to the intumescent paint. Moreover, given the court’s earlier finding that the CC could have only been issued at the earliest on 16 September 2013, when the TOP was issued, the court was of the view that Item 72(c) only needed to have been satisfied by 16 September 2013: at [198] to [200].20 The court did not find any merit in Mr Ser’s complaints relating to the soil used for the backfill, the risers of the steps, the sliding glass doors, the Volakas marble flooring, the ironwood timber decking and the punctured gas pipe: at [203], [212] to [213], [232] to [236], [240], [243] to [244], [248] to [249], [252], [254], [259] to [260], [266] and [268].21 However, in respect of the intumescent paint, the court agreed with Mr Ser’s complaints that the paint was only fire-proof for one, instead of two, hours, and secondly, that it was painted on only three, as opposed to all four sides of the trellis beams. In respect of the first complaint, the contract required the paint to have a fire-proof rating of two hours, and it was CSYA who had told GTMS that the application of paint with a one-hour fire-rating was acceptable. However, the doctrine of estoppel by representation precluded Mr Ser from claiming against GTMS. As such, only Mr Chan would be liable for the lowering of the fire rating of the intumescent paint to a one-hour rating without obtaining Mr Ser’s consent to do so. As for the second complaint, all four sides of the trellis beams had to be coated with intumescent paint and this issue entitled Mr Ser to damages. Although Mr Ser claimed the sum of $63,144, there was no breakdown as to whether this sum included the cost of dismantling the wooden trellis, applying the two-hour rated intumescent paint and then re-assembling the wooden trellis. In the circumstances, the court apportioned the sum of $63,144 as follows: Mr Chan was liable to Mr Ser for $42,096 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being two thirds of this claim, and GTMS was liable to Mr Ser for $21,048 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being one third of this claim. Lastly, although the court agreed with Mr Ser’s complaints about the intumescent paint, this was not an item that held up completion and achieving of the TOP since the registered fire inspector had passed the same, and it was therefore not a non-compliance with Item 72(c): at [215], [218], [221(h)], [222] to [223], [228] to [230].Issue 3: Whether IC 25, IC 26 and FC were properly issued22 IC 25, IC 26 and FC (the “Payment Certificates”) were validly issued and, with the exception of the intumescent paint on the steel beams, the judgment entered in respect of the Payment Certificates at $1,103,915.48 was to stand: at [274], [301].23 The court did not accept Mr Ser’s argument that Mr Chan should not have certified the release of the two moieties of retention money under IC 25 and under FC. In respect of the first moiety due under IC 25, the release of which was certified by Mr Chan on 3 September 2013, the court noted that the earliest date on which the CC could have been issued was 16 September 2013, and technically the first moiety should not have been released until or shortly after 16 September 2013. However, Mr Ser had not proved what loss or damage he had suffered as a result of certificate of its release of the first moiety some 13 days prematurely. In respect of the second moiety, the court noted that since practical completion should have been certified only on 16 September 2013, the maintenance period would only have ended on 15 September 2014. Thus, the MC could have been issued only from 16 September 2014 onwards, and the second moiety could only have been released from 16 September 2014. The FC was issued only on 22 June 2015, and in the absence of evidence that the FC was issued too early, Mr Ser could not have any valid complaint over the certification of the release of the second moiety under the FC: at [275] to [277].24 Mr Ser next complained that Mr Chan could not have certified the sums claimed by GTMS under IC 25 and IC 26 if GTMS did not adduce any proof that it had actually paid the nominated subcontractors (“NSCs”) and nominated suppliers (“NSs”). However, the reality of the construction industry was that quantity surveyors did not require contractors to first pay the subcontractors and suppliers before they could be reimbursed. In fact, it was usually the opposite, since a contractor often procured goods and services on credit and it paid its subcontractors and suppliers only upon receiving money from the owner. Nor could the SIA Conditions be interpreted to require GTMS to adduce such proof: at [280], [287] to [288].25 Mr Ser alleged that GTMS was overcharging him for the work done by NSCs and NSs. He relied on credit notes issued by various NSs and NSCs to GTMS, which made references to “discounts”. The court rejected Mr Ser’s argument as Mr Ser had only picked upon a few documents to support the allegation, which was insufficient to discharge Mr Ser’s burden of proof – the reference to “discount” in the credit notes did not necessarily mean Mr Ser had been overcharged. More importantly, the quantity surveyor would have picked up on any of such discounts. Finally, it was always open to Mr Ser to call these NSCs and NSs to the stand for evidence, as they were nominated by Mr Ser, albeit through Mr Chan, and his failure to do so would mean that he had failed to discharge his burden of proof: at [290] to [293].26 Lastly, Mr Ser challenged the Judge’s interpretation of cl 28(5) of the SIA Conditions (which dealt with the quantification of the amount that GTMS could claim from Mr Ser in relation to PC Rate items, ie, items where the quantities, at the point of contracting, could not be precisely determined). The Judge’s interpretation of the methodology in cl 28(5) was that, from the contract sum, the “relevant sum” of the PC Rate item would be deducted and the value of the actual work done would be added. The value of the actual work done was not disputed, and was calculated by multiplying the area in the contractual drawings with the actual unit rate of the PC Rate items. Mr Ser, however, argued that the “relevant sum” to be deducted referred to the “tender breakdown prices”, which were the budgeted sums handwritten by GTMS in the Preliminaries section of the Schedule of Prices in the tender documents for the Project. The court rejected Mr Ser’s argument. First, this point was not pleaded. Secondly, Mr Ser’s interpretation of what constituted the “relevant sum” was unreasonable as this submission converted what was a PC rate in the Bill of Quantities into a lumpsum where the rate became irrelevant. Mr Ser had confused a PC Rate item for supply with a PC Sum item: at [295] to [296], [299] to [300].Issue 4: The remedies available as between Mr Ser and GTMS, as well as between Mr Ser and Mr ChanAs between Mr Ser and GTMS27 Mr Ser was entitled, as against GTMS, to deduct the sum of $147,600 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ) from the $1,103,915.48 due under the Payment Certificates: at [332].28 The court did not agree with the Judge that the liquidated damages clause was inoperable because the prevention principle applied. The prevention principle had not been pleaded by GTMS: at [305], [307].29 Although the architect had not issued a Delay Certificate, liquidated damages could still be imposed on GTMS under the SIA Conditions. Clauses 37(3) and 37(4) of the SIA Conditions empowered the court to disregard the absence of a Delay Certificate. The court, as the final arbiter of all the disputes between the parties in this case, was entitled to find and hold that Mr Chan should or ought to have issued the Delay Certificate under cl 24(2) certifying that the Works ought to have been completed by 17 April 2013. Further, since the arbitrator or court could find a contractor liable for delay notwithstanding the absence of a Delay Certificate, it could also decide when the delay ended in the absence of a Termination of Delay Certificate. Liquidated damages therefore started running from 18 April 2013. Mr Chan should then have issued the Termination of Delay Certificate on 28 May 2013 and the CC on 16 September 2013 when the bungalows obtained the TOP. It followed that GTMS was liable to pay Mr Ser liquidated damages from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013, which amounted to $147,600 together with interest thereon from the date of the writ: at [308], [324], [329(b)], [330] to [332].As between Mr Ser and Mr Chan30 An architect who failed to issue a Delay Certificate may be liable to the owner for any breaches of his contractual or tortious duties owed to the owner: at [329(b)], [330].31 Mr Ser’s appeal against Mr Chan’s allegedly wrongful grants of EOT 2 and EOT 3 were dismissed. As for the Payment Certificates, Mr Ser’s appeal was dismissed save for the issue of the intumescent paint and the issue of liquidated damages. Similarly, Mr Ser’s appeal against the Judge’s exoneration of Mr Chan’s supervision was without basis and was dismissed: at [337] to [339].32 Mr Chan was wrong to have issued the CC on 15 May 2013 when it had failed the First TOP Inspection on 30 April 2013. Following the First TOP Inspection, Mr Chan had failed to properly assess the reasons for the failure and to fairly attribute the reasons for the failure to the relevant parties, including himself, and to assess the relative time taken for the rectification of each item. The court was drawn to the ineluctable conclusion that he did so as a matter of self-preservation. It appeared to the court that on the whole, Mr Chan was attempting to shield himself from the consequences of his own errors and omissions and this was done in clear and flagrant breach of his duties and certifying functions under the Contract: at [341] to [342], [344], [348], [350].33 However, Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan for the liquidated damages that Mr Ser had failed to recover from GTMS pursuant to cl 24(2) of the SIA Conditions was dismissed. A claim for liquidated damages was separate in nature and quite different from a claim against an architect for breach of contract or tort for not issuing a Delay Certificate. However, a claim against a contractor for liquidated damages (when properly certified) and a claim for damages against the architect for breach of contract and duty in not issuing a Delay Certificate could intersect when, for example, the employer could not recover those liquidated damages from the contractor because of the contractor’s intervening insolvency. In such an event, the employer’s loss and damage would, subject to the facts of each case, include the liquidated damages he could not deduct from the interim or final payments, which was now beyond his reach due to the contractor’s subsequent insolvency. In this case, there was a sum owing to GTMS by Mr Ser under the Payment Certificates and the liquidated damages as ascertained by this court could be set off against that Sum. No loss had as yet arisen. This sum had not yet been paid by Mr Ser because there was a consent order for a stay of execution pending appeal. Further, a liquidated damages claim against GTMS was based on the contract between GTMS and Mr Ser. Mr Ser could not, without more, transplant that agreed pre-estimate of the loss from his contract with GTMS to his contract with Mr Chan: at [351], [354] to [355].34 Nonetheless, in his claim for professional negligence against Mr Chan, Mr Ser was entitled to claim and prove any loss and damage he sustained as a result of Mr Chan’s breach of contract and breach of duty. However, since Mr Ser had not been able to prove any loss or damage arising from the premature issue of the MC, the premature release of the moieties of retention monies or the incorrect certification of the maintenance or DLP, the court made no awards on those claims. Mr Ser also could not raise his claim for loss of rental revenue again, after having withdrawn it under cross-examination. Mr Ser had not pleaded any other alternative general or special damages suffered as a result of Mr Chan’s breaches of contract and grossly negligent acts. The Judge was therefore correct in awarding Mr Ser nominal damages of $1,000: at [356] to [359].35 Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan for out-of-pocket expenses for the summary judgment application, appeals and related interlocutory proceedings, quantified at some $649,082.63, was rejected. First, Mr Ser had failed to plead this claim. Secondly, the summary judgment application concerned IC 25, IC 26 and FC; however, the court had found the sums certified under these Payment Certificates to be largely correct. The only certificate tainted with negligence was the CC. Thirdly, it was not readily apparent that the claim for costs of the summary judgment proceedings would be costs within the reasonable contemplation of either Mr Ser or Mr Chan, either as a matter of tort or contract: at [360] to [361].Costs36 The court upheld the Judge’s costs orders as between Mr Ser and GTMS and as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan: at [374], [377].37 The Judge ordered Mr Ser to pay costs to GTMS on a standard basis from the date the writ was filed up until the date of the commencement of the trial on 8 November 2018, with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. The Judge placed significance on the fact that Mr Ser had indulged in speculative claims and allegations, that Mr Ser’s claims were highly unreasonable and exaggerated, and that in the course of the trial, Mr Ser raised new evidence and new allegations that had not been set out in his pleadings or in his AEICs. The court found Mr Ser’s reasons to resist the order for costs on an indemnity basis unconvincing: at [364] to [365], [367], [371], [373] to [374].38 The Judge found that Mr Chan sent Mr Ser two letters containing offers to settle. The Judge ordered Mr Ser to pay Mr Chan costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (the date of the third-party notice to join Mr Chan and CSYA to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (the deadline for Mr Ser to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. The court agreed with the Judge that Mr Chan’s offers to settle, while not compliant with O 22A of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), could nevertheless be considered in ordering costs. The Judge’s costs order proceeded on the premise that the two offers were more favourable to Mr Ser than what he ultimately received. That conclusion had not been altered by the appeal and the Judge’s cost order as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan was to stand: at [375] to [377].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
