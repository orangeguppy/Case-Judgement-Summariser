SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE28 April 2023Case SummaryWFE v WFF [2023] SGHC(A) 16Civil Appeal No 61 of 2022--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court (delivered by Justice Debbie Ong):Outcome: The Appellate Division of the High Court (the “Court”) allowed the appeal in part against the High Court judge’s (the “Judge”) decision pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets. The Court maintained the Judge’s determination and valuation of the pool of matrimonial assets as well as the Judge’s determination of the parties’ indirect contributions but varied the Judge’s determination of the parties’ direct contributions. The Court highlighted that the determination of the parties’ direct contributions entails ascribing a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisition of the matrimonial asset, relative to the other party. This is done on a broad-brush approach. The crux of the exercise is in ascertaining the parties’ respective direct contributions towards acquiring the matrimonial assets. In doing so, the court does not necessarily need to determine the parties’ property rights or specific beneficial ownership in the assets to calculate the direct contributions of the parties. What is instead important is the financial contributions that go towards an asset falling within the definition of “matrimonial asset”.Background1 The husband (“H”) and the wife (“W”) were married in June 1997. The parties have three sons. W commenced divorce proceedings against H in 2020 and an Interim Judgment (“IJ”) of divorce was granted in 2021. The parties sought orders for the division of matrimonial assets and the children’s maintenance.2 The Judge identified the value of the pool of matrimonial assets to be $9,832,718.29. Among other assets, the Judge included in the pool of matrimonial assets the following: (a) W’s personal Central Depository Account ending 5068 (the “CDP Account”), which was valued at $3,007,166.98; (b) a Honda Fit vehicle (the “Vehicle”) which H had used $40,000 from the parties’ joint bank account to pay for; and (c) a sum of $89,858.54 which was part of W’s personal bank account ending 7001, that W claimed she was holding on trust for her eldest son (the “Insurance Moneys”). The Judge also determined that W contributed 52.2% (ie, $2,004,330.68) and H contributed 47.8% (ie, $1,832,177.33) towards the parties’ matrimonial home at Toh Tuck Walk (the “Toh Tuck Property”). In all, the Judge determined that W was entitled to 59.63% (ie, $5,863,249.92) and H was entitled to 40.37% (ie, $3,969,468.37) of the pool of matrimonial assets. This was on the average of the parties’ direct contributions of 64.25:35.75 in the favour of W, and indirect contributions of 55:45 also in the favour of W. 3 W appealed only against the Judge’s orders pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets. She contended that the Judge erred in finding that the CDP Account and the Insurance Moneys were matrimonial assets. She also contested the Judge’s determination of the parties’ direct contributions to the Toh Tuck Property. W further submitted that the Judge’s determination of the parties’ indirect contributions is erroneous.The Court’s judgment Identification of matrimonial assets4 The court’s power to divide assets is contained in the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). Section 112(10) of the Charter sets out the key features of matrimonial assets. Assets that do not have these features may still be “transformed” into matrimonial assets if they have sufficient connection to the marriage as set out in the Charter’s regime: at [14] to [15].5 In respect of the CDP Account, W argued that she adduced sufficient evidence to show that the holdings in the CDP Account were derived from her inheritance. There was no basis to disturb the Judge’s determination that the CDP Account is a matrimonial asset. W had not provided the evidence to show that the funds in the CDP Account were traceable to her inheritance moneys: at [18] to [20].6 W also argued that she received a substantial sum of moneys from the sale of two inherited properties that were then invested into the securities held in the CDP Account. This was on the basis of a set of documents that she adduced as part of the appeal. This was clearly part of her attempt to bolster her case as it would be more believable that the substantial value of the CDP Account arose from a larger sum of moneys. It was surprising that W omitted to adduce this evidence or make this argument before the Judge given that this might have significantly strengthened her case on this front. In any event, the documents adduced did not remedy the lacuna in her case that there was no evidence that she used moneys from her inheritance (including the proceeds from the sale of the two private properties) to purchase the securities in the CDP Account: at [4], [18] and [21].7 W further submitted that she had a meagre income which was mostly spent on household expenses. She thus could not have contributed the monthly sum required over the past 23 years to achieve the current value of the CDP Account. The Court did not agree that this was necessarily the conclusion. Among other things, the CDP Account was not a savings account where the moneys are accumulated more or less linearly, and W’s reasons for why her earnings were limited were vague and unexceptional: at [22] to [25].8 In respect of the Insurance Moneys, these were paid out by NTUC Income to W after the endowment insurance policy matured on 7 August 2018. W claimed that she held the Insurance Moneys on trust for their eldest son. There was no basis to disturb the Judge’s finding that the Insurance Moneys is a matrimonial asset. W’s claim was not supported by the evidence. The letter from NTUC Income only showed that the eldest son was the insured and that W is the policy holder. It did not indicate that the eldest son was nominated or named as the beneficiary of the policy: at [28].Determination of the parties’ direct contributions9 The determination of the parties’ direct contributions is the first step of the structured approach in ANJ v ANK [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“ANJ”). The structured approach is a broad-brush one, not to be applied in a rigid and overly mathematical manner. The broad-brush approach similarly applies in the determination of the parties’ direct contributions in the first step of the structured approach: at [33] to [35]10 At the first step of the structured approach, the crux of the exercise is in ascertaining the parties’ respective direct contributions towards acquiring the matrimonial assets. In this step, the court does not necessarily need to determine the parties’ property rights or specific beneficial ownership in the assets in order to calculate the direct contributions of the parties. What is instead important is the financial contributions that go towards an asset falling within the definition of “matrimonial asset”. This is a strictly evidential exercise that is done on a broad-brush basis: at [36] to [37]11 The Toh Tuck Property was purchased in 2012. W’s appeal against the Judge’s determination of the parties’ direct contributions to the Toh Tuck Property forms a substantial part of the appeal. W contests the Judge’s determination on four sources of funds that went towards the property: at [38]. 12 The first source of funds is what is termed the Merrill Lynch Funds, which comprise a sum of $2,031,353.68. The funds originate from shares inherited by W from her late father. The shares were transferred to the parties’ joint Merrill Lynch account in about 2004. They were then liquidated and transferred to the parties’ joint bank account before being applied towards the purchase of the Toh Tuck Property: at [39]. 13 The Judge attributed the Merrill Lynch Funds equally between the parties as their direct contributions on the basis that W’s transfer of shares to the parties’ parties’ joint Merrill Lynch account and of moneys to the parties’ joint bank account were indicative of her intention to share the moneys with H. The Court found that the Judge’s analysis in crediting equal direct contributions for the Merrill Lynch Funds conflates the determination of the parties’ specific beneficial interests in the Merrill Lynch Funds with the determination of who contributed the Merrill Lynch Funds. As the Merrill Lynch Funds clearly originated from W, she was to be credited for the contributions of the Merrill Lynch Funds whether or not she had the intention to share the Merrill Lynch Funds with H. Whether W shared the Merrill Lynch Funds with H would be relevant instead in determining if the Merrill Lynch Funds, being derived from her inheritance, should be included in the matrimonial pool. This, however, was not what the Court was concerned with: at [40] to [43].14 The Court undertook a detailed analysis of the significance of a spouse’s intention to share in the context of determining parties’ direct contributions. This involved an analysis of the Court of Appeal’s decision in CLC v CLB [2023] SGCA 10. The Court concluded that the intention to share one’s inherited assets is relevant in ascertaining whether the asset is part of the pool of matrimonial assets. Beyond that, the notion of sharing does not feature in the specific analysis in the determination of parties’ contributions: at [45] to [48].15 The Merrill Lynch Funds were attributed entirely to W as her direct contributions towards the Toh Tuck property: at [50].16 The second source of funds is what is termed the Novena Lodge Proceeds. This is a sum of $220,000 which originated from W’s sale of a property at Novena Lodge that was in her sole name. W transferred the sale proceeds in three tranches from her personal bank account to the parties’ joint bank account on 21 May 2012 ($120,000), 28 May 2012 ($20,000) and 20 June 2012 ($80,000): at [51].17 The Judge apportioned the Novena Lodge Proceeds equally between the parties as their direct contributions to the Toh Tuck Property. This was on the basis that W had chosen to transfer the funds to the parties’ joint bank account, and thus intended to share the proceeds with H. The Court observed that it was undisputed that W purchased the Novena Lodge property in her sole name, and that she alone contributed to the Novena Lodge Proceeds. For the purposes of determining her direct contribution towards the acquisition of the Toh Tuck Property, the Novena Lodge Proceeds used for the purchase should be fully credited to her as her direct contributions: at [56].18 The Court observed that W’s transfer of the last tranche of the Novena Lodge Proceeds of $80,000 occurred on a date subsequent to the completion of the purchase of the Toh Tuck Property. W suggested that these funds went towards the renovation costs of the Toh Tuck Property. Similarly, the Court noted that H’s transfer of a sum of $88,249.41, which went towards the Toh Tuck Property, to the parties’ joint bank account occurred after the completion of the purchase of the Toh Tuck Property. H did not take the position that the moneys went towards the renovation costs of the Toh Tuck Property. H only highlighted that he did not take such a position before the Judge. The Court noted that whether these funds went towards the acquisition or the renovation of the Toh Tuck Property would not make a material difference to the determination of the parties’ direct contributions to the Toh Tuck Property. The parties’ contributions to the acquisition or the renovation of the Toh Tuck Property may be taken into account in ascertaining their direct contributions to the property: at [58] to [59].19 The Court attributed $140,000 of the Novena Lodge Proceeds to W as her direct contribution towards the acquisition of the Toh Tuck Property: at [60].20 The third source of funds is what is termed the Pulasan Property Net Proceeds. This refers to a sum of $580,156.92 that arose from the sale of the parties’ previous home (the “Pulasan property”), which went towards the purchase of the Toh Tuck Property. The Court found no reason to disturb the Judge’s equal apportionment of the Pulasan Property Net Proceeds. The Court determined that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain the parties’ contributions to the Pulasan property. There was no documentary evidence concerning the parties’ contributions. This was unsurprising given that the property was acquired more than two decades ago. Applying a broad-brush approach, and keeping in view the gaps in the evidence as well as the significant time that has elapsed, an equal attribution of the sale proceeds of the Pulasan property as the parties’ direct contributions was fair: at [61] to [63].21 The fourth source of funds refers to a sum of $229,466.00 which was paid from the parties’ joint bank account between 5 July 2012 and 18 November 2012. These are termed as the “Renovation Cheques”. The Judge attributed the sum equally between the parties as their direct contributions: at [64].22 The Court attributed $80,000 of the Renovation Cheques to W. This arose from W’s third (and last) deposit of the Novena Lodge Proceeds, which was deposited in the parties’ joint bank account at a time proximate to the payment of the renovation costs. The Court also attributed the sum of $88,249.41 to H. This sum arose from H’s sale of shares. The funds were put into the parties’ joint bank account at a timing that overlapped with the period of the payment of renovation costs. As for the balance of $61,216.59, there was no evidence as to which party made the relevant contributions. Thus, the sum was apportioned equally between the parties as their direct contributions. The Court found that H contributed $118,857.70 while W contributed $110,608.29 to the Renovation Cheques: at [65] to [66].23 In respect of the Toh Tuck Property, the Court held that W contributed 82.8% (instead of 52.2%), which amounts to $3,003,600.81 while H contributed 17.2% (instead of 47.8%), which amounts to $622,375.78: at [67].24 Apart from the Toh Tuck Property, W also contested the Judge’s determination of the parties’ direct contributions to the Vehicle. H had taken $40,000 to purchase the Vehicle. The Judge attributed the $40,000 fully to H. The Court found that the $40,000 should be apportioned equally between the parties as there was no evidence to trace the $40,000 to a contribution made by either party to the joint account. Accordingly, H contributed 70.3% (instead of 100%) which amounts to $47,452.00 while W contributed 29.7% (instead of 0%) which amounts to $20,000.00: at [67].25 In conclusion, the parties’ direct contributions to the total pool of matrimonial assets should thus be adjusted to W contributing 76.9% (instead of 64.25%) and H contributing 23.1% (instead of 35.75%): at [70].Determination of the parties’ indirect contributions26 The Court found that there was no reason to disturb the Judge’s determination of the parties’ indirect contributions of 55:45 in W’s favour. The Judge had adequately considered the relevant factors, and had determined correctly, on a broad-brush approach, that both parties made substantial contributions to the marriage and that the parties’ indirect contributions should tend towards an equal apportionment, albeit slightly tilted in favour of W: at [72]Conclusion27 To summarise, the parties’ direct contributions were apportioned 76.9:23.1 in favour of W. The parties’ indirect contributions were apportioned 55:45 in favour of W. The average ratio of the parties’ direct contributions and indirect contributions was 65.95% (instead of 59.63%) for W and 34.05% (instead of 40.37%) for H. The pool of matrimonial assets valued at $9,832,718.29 was to be divided in accordance with the average ratio. W was to receive assets valued at $6,484,677.71 and H was to receive assets valued at $3,348,040.58: at [74] and [75].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
