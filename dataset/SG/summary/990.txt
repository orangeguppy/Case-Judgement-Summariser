SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE28 February 2022Case summaryTan Seng Kee v Attorney-General and other appeals [2022] SGCA 16Civil Appeals Nos 54, 55 and 71 of 2020--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Sundaresh Menon CJ):CoA dismisses appeal against decision that s 377A of the Penal Code does not violate Arts 9, 12 and/or 14 of the Constitution. Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The Attorney-General’s representations that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute cases that may be caught under s 377A where the conduct in question was between two consenting adults in a private place (“the Subset”) is given legal force by the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations.•  The recognition of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations as part of Singapore law is extremely limited in material scope, namely, in respect of s 377A cases only.•  Section 377A is unenforceable in its entirety, unless and until the Attorney-General of the day provides clear notice that he, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor: (a) intends to reassert his right to enforce s 377A proactively by way of prosecution; and (b) will no longer abide by the representations made by Attorney-General Mr Lucien Wong SC in 2018 as to the prosecutorial policy that applies to conduct falling within the Subset.•  In the circumstances, the appellants do not face any real and credible threat of prosecution under s 377A at this time and therefore lack standing to mount the constitutional challenges that they brought against this provision.Background to the appeals and the material facts1 This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in Ong Ming Johnson v Attorney-General and other matters [2020] SGHC 63 that s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“s 377A” and “the PC” respectively) does not violate Arts 9, 12 and/or 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”).2 On 22 October 2007, a petition to repeal s 377A was presented to Parliament. Although no vote was taken on that petition, s 377A was debated extensively in Parliament (“the s 377A Debates”). While s 377A was retained, the Prime Minister made clear that this was on the terms that it would not be proactively enforced (“the political compromise”). 3 Amidst the ongoing discussion on the retention or repeal of s 377A, Attorney-General Mr Lucien Wong SC (“AG Wong”), in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor (“the PP”), clarified in 2018 the prosecutorial policy in respect of offences falling under that provision. He stated that where the conduct in question was between two consenting adult men in a private place (“the Subset”), the PP had, absent other factors, taken the position that prosecution would not be in the public interest (“AG Wong’s representations”).4 The three appellants, who are homosexual men, contend that s 377A is unconstitutional by reason of its inconsistency with Arts 9, 12 and/or 14 of the Constitution (“Art 9”, “Art 12” and “Art 14” respectively). They sought declaratory relief and/or the voiding of s 377A to the extent of any such inconsistency with the Constitution.The proceedings below5 In the court below, counsel for the appellant in CA/CA 71/2020 (“Mr Choong”) focused on the proper interpretation of s 377A and the alleged unconstitutionality of that provision under Arts 12 and 14. First, he contended that s 377A, properly construed, criminalises only commercial sexual activity between men (meaning male prostitution) and not private consensual sex acts of a non-commercial nature. Second, he highlighted that when s 377A was enacted in 1938, penetrative sex acts were already criminalised as the offence of “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 20, 1936 Rev Ed) (“s 377”). He argued that s 377A was only intended to criminalise sex acts that were not already offences under s 377 – namely, non-penetrative sex acts. 6 As to the alleged unconstitutionality of s 377A, Mr Choong’s counsel submitted that s 377A fails the “reasonable classification” test and therefore violates Art 12. He also proposed that the court adopt a proportionality-based test in place of the “reasonable classification” test for the purposes of assessing the constitutionality of a statutory provision under Art 12. Further, he argued that s 377A is inconsistent with Art 14 because it curtails the expression of love and closeness through consensual acts of sexual intimacy between men.7 Counsel for the appellant in CA/CA 55/2020 (“Mr Ong”) primarily argued that s 377A is inconsistent with Art 9(1) because it is absurd and arbitrary in criminalising individuals by reason of their sexual identity which was immutable.8 Counsel for the appellant in CA/CA 54/2020 (“Dr Tan”) broadly focused on the absurdity and arbitrariness of retaining s 377A in the light of the Government’s avowed position that s 377A would not be proactively enforced where conduct falling within the Subset is concerned. He also aligned himself with the other appellants’ submissions that s 377A falls afoul of Arts 9, 12 and 14.9 The Judge found that s 377A does not violate Arts 9, 12 and/or 14 and thus dismissed all three applications brought by the appellants.The parties’ respective cases on appeal10 On appeal, counsel for Mr Choong focused on the proper interpretation of s 377A and maintained that s 377A was only intended to cover non-penetrative sex acts between men. According to him, the extraneous material as well as the architecture of and the language used in the PC show that the offences under s 377A and s 377 were intended to be strictly non-overlapping. Additionally, he submitted that s 377A violates Arts 12 and 14. In that regard, the Judge erred in finding that there was a complete coincidence between the differentia in and the legislative object of s 377A, as well as in interpreting the term “expression” in Art 14(1)(a) restrictively.11 Counsel for Mr Ong submitted that sexual orientation is immutable. In view of this, he argues that s 377A exposes a class of persons to the risk of incarceration on account of their sexual identity while failing to advance any compelling object. He therefore contends that s 377A is “absurd” and, consequently, not “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1). Furthermore, s 377A is “arbitrary” and contrary to the rule of law.12 Counsel for Dr Tan placed greater weight on the legislative intention underpinning the retention of s 377A in 2007 than on the legislative purpose behind its enactment in 1938. He submitted that the differentia in s 377A is necessarily unintelligible because the s 377A Debates evince an express legislative intention for s 377A to be legally untidy and ambiguous. Assuming that the legislative purpose underlying the retention of s 377A was to discourage gay rights advocacy while accommodating homosexual individuals in society, there is no rational relation between that purpose and the differentia in s 377A.13 The respondent maintained that s 377A does not fall foul of Arts 9, 12 or 14 of the Constitution. Counsel for the respondent submitted that s 377A covers both penetrative and non-penetrative sex acts, and is not limited to sexual activity involving male prostitution. In that regard, the legislative purpose of s 377A should be discerned only at the time of its enactment in 1938. Furthermore, she submitted that the scientific evidence is inconclusive as to the alleged immutability of sexual orientation.The issues on appeal14 The overarching question in these appeals is whether s 377A is inconsistent with Arts 9, 12 and/or 14 and, hence, unconstitutional to the extent of any such inconsistency. To this end, five main issues arise for the court’s consideration:(a) whether sexual orientation is immutable;(b) the proper interpretation of s 377A; (c) whether s 377A violates Art 9; (d) whether s 377A violates Art 14; and (e) whether s 377A violates Art 12.15 In the light of AG Wong’s representations, the anterior question to resolve is the basis upon which those representations may be said to possess legal force and their precise legal consequences (“the Anterior Question”).The Court of Appeal’s decisionThe Anterior Question16 It would be contrived and unrealistic to ignore the totality of the political compromise and AG Wong’s representations (“the political package”) when assessing the legality of s 377A as the political package has, in effect, significantly altered both the way in which s 377A practically affects the lives of homosexual men and what the provision means in Singapore today. The Anterior Question is not concerned with the purpose behind the enactment of s 377A in 1938, but rather, the equally important purpose behind its retention in 2007 (at [66], [67] and [69]).17 Reading the s 377A Debates as a whole, it is abundantly clear that the Government was focused on reaching a socio-political compromise that would balance various competing interests and accommodate differing perspectives on homosexuality. The Prime Minister set out the prevailing position in terms that homosexual men were not being and would not be harassed because s 377A would not be proactively enforced. The Prime Minister also addressed the concern of “legal untidiness and ambiguity” and explained that maintaining the status quo was preferable to risking societal division over s 377A (at [78], [79] and [81]).18 While the Prime Minister’s speech during the s 377A Debates is undoubtedly important, such ministerial statements do not bind the PP, who exercises his prosecutorial discretion independently. In contrast, AG Wong’s representations in 2018 are legally significant as they contain guidelines on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in relation to s 377A offences, which guidelines are broadly aligned with the public policy and public interest expressed by the Prime Minister during the s 377A Debates as well as the Government’s stance that s 377A would not be proactively enforced (at [82] and [88]–[90]).19 Indeed, the parties mostly agree that AG Wong’s representations must be of some legal effect and that the constitutionality of s 377A cannot be analysed in complete disregard of those representations (at [91] and [116]).20 The exceptional circumstances surrounding the general non-enforcement of s 377A call for a limited recognition of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations as the basis for imbuing AG Wong’s representations with legal force. The recognition of this doctrine is extremely limited in material scope, given the specific circumstances in which the political package was arrived at. In giving effect to the expectations of homosexual men that s 377A will generally not be enforced in respect of acts falling within the Subset, the court would be giving effect to the political compromise on s 377A without constraining any future legislative or executive action regarding that provision. There is also no issue of a possible encroachment on the PP’s prosecutorial discretion in the circumstances (at [117] and [132]–[136]). 21 The legitimate expectation engendered by AG Wong’s representations is that the PP will not prosecute conduct falling within the Subset under s 377A. There is no doubt that these representations were made by a person with actual authority to do so: they were made by AG Wong in his official capacity as the Attorney-General (“the AG”), in which capacity he exercised the powers and office of the PP (at [146]–[147]).22 In answer to the Anterior Question, the court held that s 377A is unenforceable in its entirety, unless and until the AG of the day provides clear notice that he, in his capacity as the PP: (a) intends to reassert his right to enforce s 377A proactively by way of prosecution; and (b) will no longer abide by the representations made by AG Wong in 2018 as to the prosecutorial policy that applies to conduct falling within the Subset. In view of this decision, which gives legal effect to AG Wong’s representations without importing the uncertainties that would otherwise continue to plague homosexual men, the appellants cannot be said to face any real and credible threat of prosecution under s 377A at this time. It follows that there is in fact no controversy and, at present, no threat of any violation of their rights under Arts 9, 12 and 14. The appellants hence do not have standing to mount their constitutional challenges against s 377A. The court’s views on the interpretive and constitutional issues raised by the appellants are thus purely obiter since they do not arise for determination in these appeals (at [149]–[153]).Observations on the issues raised by the appellants23 Dr Tan and Mr Ong urged the court to find that sexual orientation is immutable as a matter of general scientific fact. The breadth of the issue quite clearly indicates that the question is in fact an extra-legal scientific matter beyond the court’s purview (at [156] and [158]).24 On the proper interpretation of s 377A, the only possible interpretation of the words “gross indecency” is one that: (a) includes penetrative sex acts; and (b) is not limited to male prostitution. On a plain reading, the term “gross indecency” cannot sensibly be limited to non-penetrative sex acts and must extend to penetrative sex acts. This interpretation is not displaced by the new extraneous material considered by the court in the present appeals (at [167] and [235]).25 The deprivation of personal liberty that s 377A may engender does not fall within the scope of protection afforded by Art 9(1). It is well established that unenumerated substantive rights cannot be read into the Constitution. The words “life or personal liberty” in Art 9(1) refer only to freedom from unlawful deprivation of life and unlawful detention or incarceration (at [244]–[245], [247] and [252]).26 Section 377A is prima facie “written law” and thus “law” as defined in Art 2(1) of the Constitution. However, Art 9(1) does not justify all legislation that deprives a person of his life or personal liberty. The test of “absurdity” is procedural in nature and does not permit the court to examine the substantive content of s 377A. Based on this test, s 377A is not “absurd”. Further, it is evident, from comments made by Members of Parliament during the s 377A Debates, that there are thought to be many in Singapore who genuinely and sincerely oppose the repeal of s 377A, and their views can hardly be dismissed as absurd by any reasonable measure (at [254], [265], [268] and [269]). 27 Having regard to the context of Art 14(1)(a) in the Constitution, it is clear that the primary right protected thereunder is that of “freedom of speech” and not “freedom of expression”. The Art 14 constitutional challenge to s 377A must proceed from the premise that the term “speech” includes acts of gross indecency. However, such acts are not “speech” to begin with; in any event, extending the protection afforded under Art 14(1)(a) to acts of gross indecency would generate an absurd result that could not have been intended by the constitutional draftsmen. Furthermore, s 377A cannot be said to have a chilling effect on gay rights advocacy (at [279], [294] and [295]–[299]).28 The established test for assessing whether a statutory provision is constitutional under Art 12 is the “reasonable classification” test. There are two main differences between the two leading approaches to this test, namely: (a) whether, albeit in an extreme minority of cases, the first limb of the test permits consideration of the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of the differentia embodied in the statutory provision in question; and (b) the level of scrutiny to which the impugned statutory provision is subject, having regard to its correctly identified object and its relationship with the differentia employed. In the present appeals, it is unnecessary to decide which approach should be preferred (at [305], [313] and [329]).29 A key issue in the application of the “reasonable classification” test is the level of generality at which the legislative object of the statutory provision in question is pitched. If one were to articulate the legislative object of the statutory provision in whatever terms would support one’s desired interpretation of the provision, the “reasonable classification” test could be reduced to nothing more than an exercise in legal formalism. The court should therefore be chary of construing or applying the “reasonable classification” test in a manner that effectively denudes Art 12 of real force.
