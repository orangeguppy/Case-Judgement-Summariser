Case Summary
Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd and others v Sim Chye Hock Ron [2018] SGCA 64
Civil Appeal No 105 of 2017 and Summons No 31 of 2018
_____________________________________________________________________
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon):
Outcome: CoA upholds striking out of third party proceedings on the basis that they are redundant and therefore disclose no reasonable cause of action. 
Introduction
1          The appellants were three of the defendants in Suit No 17 of 2017 (“Suit 17”). They commenced a third party action against the respondent, who applied to strike out that action. The High Court struck out the third party proceedings pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) on the bases that they were redundant, disclosed no reasonable cause of action and were not required for the determination of common issues under O 16 r 1(1)(c).
2          The appellants appealed against the striking out. They also applied to the Court of Appeal (“the CoA”) by way of Summons No 31 of 2018 (“SUM 31”) for leave to amend their third party statement of claim (“TPSOC”). The CoA dismissed both SUM 31 and the appeal against the striking out.
Background to the appeal
3          Suit 17 was a minority oppression action commenced by EQ Capital Investments Ltd (“EQ Capital”), a minority shareholder of Wellness Group Pte Ltd (“Wellness”). The first appellant was the majority shareholder of Wellness and the second and third appellants were directors of Wellness. EQ Capital alleged that the appellants had damaged EQ Capital’s interests in various ways, including by allowing Wellness’ shareholding in TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd (“TWG”) to be diluted and by failing to cause Wellness to appoint a director to TWG’s board. The respondent was said to be the alter ego and/or controlling mind and will of both EQ Capital and another of TWG’s shareholders, OSIM International Pte Ltd (“OSIM”). In their defence, the appellants alleged that the matters which EQ Capital complained of in Suit 17 had been brought about by the respondent through OSIM. They further alleged that it was an abuse of process for the respondent, having caused and/or benefited from those matters, to procure EQ Capital to commence Suit 17 in respect of the very same matters. These allegations also formed the basis of the appellants’ third party claims against the respondent for an indemnity or contribution.
4          In SUM 31, the appellants sought leave to amend their TPSOC to expressly plead ss 15 and 16 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the CLA”), to include two new causes of action in tort against the respondent and to pray for damages to be assessed in respect of those torts. 
The decision on appeal
5          The CoA dismissed SUM 31 for two principal reasons. First, the application could and should have been made before the High Court at first instance. Second, the amendments sought to be made were substantial and, if allowed, would have put the third party claims on a wholly different footing. This would have required the CoA to decide the appeal based on an entirely different set of arguments from those canvassed before the High Court, which was at odds with the exercise of appellate jurisdiction: at [26] and [27].
6          The CoA also dismissed the appellants’ appeal against the striking out of their TPSOC. The third party claims were redundant because they rested on the same basis as the defence: namely, that the respondent (through OSIM) both brought about and benefited from the very matters which he (through EQ Capital) now complained of in Suit 17. There was no reasonably conceivable situation in which the appellants might fail in their defence and yet have a viable basis for seeking a contribution or an indemnity from the respondent: at [33]. 
7          Counsel for the appellants advanced four bases on which the appellants might be entitled to a contribution or an indemnity from the respondent even if they failed in their defence, namely: (a) the doctrine of abuse of process; (b) the doctrine of unjust enrichment; (c) the principles said to have been articulated in Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others and other appeals [2013] 1 SLR 374 (“Raffles Town Club”); and (d) ss 15 and 16 of the CLA. None of these was viable for the following reasons:
(a)        First, the appellants’ TPSOC did not plead abuse of process as a tort, nor did Singapore law recognise such a tort. Furthermore, if the allegation of abuse of process were made out, it would constitute a defence to EQ Capital’s claims against the appellants, and there would then be no basis for the appellants to pursue their third party claims against the respondent: at [37], [38].
(b)        Second, the third party statement of claim did not plead unjust enrichment as a cause of action. The words “unjustly enrich” were included only to support their allegation of abuse of process: at [40], [42].
(c)        Third, Raffles Town Club did not establish a new legal basis for ordering an indemnity or contribution against the directors of a company where they acted unconscionably and/or in bad faith in causing the company to commence proceedings for the purposes of unjustly enriching themselves. No contribution or indemnity was ordered against the third parties in Raffles Town Club, and although the court ordered them to bear the defendants’ costs on an indemnity basis, this was based not on unconscionability or unjust enrichment, but on their liability to the defendants for the tort of conspiracy: at [43], [50]–[53].
(d)        Fourth, s 15 of the CLA only applied where the defendant and the third party were both liable to some other person in respect of the same damage. In this case, there was no reasonably conceivable scenario in which the respondent could be liable to Wellness in respect of the same damage as the appellants. Even if the respondent could hypothetically be liable to Wellness for acting in abuse of the court’s process in procuring EQ Capital to commence Suit 17, or on the basis of unjust enrichment, the damage which he would be liable to Wellness for would be different from the types of damage which the appellants were said to be liable for in Suit 17: at [54], [60], [61].
8          Since none of the four bases above could possibly lead to success in the third party proceedings without simultaneously vindicating the appellants’ defence, the third party proceedings were redundant. There was thus no need for the issues which had to be determined as between EQ Capital and the appellants in the main action to be determined as between the appellants and the respondent. The appeal was therefore dismissed: at [63].
