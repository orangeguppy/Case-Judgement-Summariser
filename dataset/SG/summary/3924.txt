Case Summary
Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd and others [2019] SGCA 13
Civil Appeal No 47 of 2018
_____________________________________________________________________
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong):
Outcome: CoA allows an appeal in negligence in that Changi General Hospital had failed to put in place a system for proper follow-up of radiological results and patient management, causing a delay in the diagnosis of the appellant’s lung cancer.
Introduction
1          The appellant patient first visited the respondent, Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) on 31 October 2007. A chest X-ray was taken and an opacity was noted. She was subsequently referred to the second respondent, Dr Imran bin Mohamed Noor (“Dr Imran”), a specialist respiratory physician. On 15 November 2007, Dr Imran ordered two further X-rays and assessed that the opacity “appeared to be resolving or had resolved on its own”. Dr Imran gave the appellant an open date for follow-up.
2          On 29 April 2010 and 31 July 2011, she visited CGH’s Accident and Emergency (“A&E”) department, where she was attended to by the third respondent, Dr Yap Hsiang (“Dr Yap”) and the fourth respondent, Dr Soh Wei Wen Jason (“Dr Soh”), who were both A&E practitioners. On both occasions, the respective doctors ordered chest X-rays. Dr Yap concluded that the opacity was stable as it remained similar in size. Dr Soh did not detect the opacity. The X-rays were sent for reporting. Both times, the radiologist recommended follow-up for the opacity but none was carried out.
3          On 28 November 2011, the appellant visited Raffles Medical Clinic complaining of cough, breathlessness and blood in her sputum. On 1 December 2011, a chest X-ray was taken. She was eventually referred to a respiratory physician in CGH, who then ordered a CT scan. This showed a nodule. The consultant radiologist compared the previous X-rays to determine growth of the nodule over time and then recommended a biopsy.
4          On 16 February 2012, the biopsy confirmed that the nodule was malignant and that the appellant had lung cancer. The appellant underwent a lobectomy in March 2012, and she was diagnosed with Stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer. In August 2014, the appellant suffered a relapse and a biopsy revealed the lung cancer had progressed to Stage IV and she was suffering from a rare echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (“EML4”)-ALK gene rearrangement. As of October 2016, the cancer had progressed to the appellant’s brain and mediastinal lymph node. 
5          The appellant brought suit against the respondents for medical negligence. She claimed that if there had been no delay in her diagnosis, her medical outcome would have been different. In the lower court, the Judge dismissed the appellant’s claim on the issue of causation, finding that the appellant’s nodule was initially benign and had only turned malignant after July 2011. Nevertheless, the Judge found that Dr Imran was in breach by giving the appellant an open date to return when he should have ensured the opacity had completely resolved. The Judge also found CGH was in breach of its duty of care by failing to send the April 2010 and July 2011 X-ray reports to the appellant and failing to communicate the findings of the X-ray reports. However, as just mentioned, neither was liable to the appellant, given the Judge’s decision on the issue of causation.
The Court of Appeal’s decision
6          The assessment of whether there has been negligence in cases of diagnosis involving questions of interpretation and opinion is intensely contextual. It requires a review of the practitioner’s decisions and actions against established standards within the medical industry and consideration of the perspective of other reasonable doctors and what they would have done in the circumstances, with the information available: at [63] and [65].
7          A&E doctors work under intense time constraints and have to adopt a “targeted approach” to life-threatening conditions. That is not to say that incidental findings can be ignored. An A&E doctor owes a duty to apply his or her mind to all findings, even incidental ones. But depending on the incidental finding, clinical history and lack of urgency, an A&E doctor may refer the patient to the appropriate department or order the necessary tests. The patient may have to rely on the system and department as a whole instead of a particular doctor and it is the responsibility of the hospital to put in place a proper system to ensure these tests are conducted and results properly followed up upon. Where an incidental finding needs to be treated urgently, an A&E doctor cannot ignore it and simply treat the patient’s presenting symptoms: [68]–[75].
8          The Judge’s finding that the A&E doctors were not in breach of their duties of care was affirmed:
a.         Dr Yap did not ignore the opacity, but retrieved the November 2007 X-ray and compared it with the April 2010 X-ray concluding the nodule was stable. He ordered that the April 2010 X-ray be reported on and that the appellant be called back if necessary. This was sufficient to discharge his duty. However, the mere fact that a specialist had previously attended to a patient is not sufficient reason not to investigate further and to conclude that no further follow-up is necessary: at [76] and [79].
b.         Dr Soh did not detect the opacity because he was focused on the left side of the appellant’s chest, where she complained the pain was coming from. This was not unreasonable. He had adopted a targeted approach and his priority was to resolve the appellant’s presenting complaints: [81] and [82].
9          The Judge’s finding that Dr Imran was in breach of his duty of care was affirmed. If Dr Imran was unsure if the opacity had resolved, he should not have discharged the appellant without a scheduled follow-up appointment. As the specialist who was “last in line” to diagnose a lung opacity, no one else would have been in a better position to conduct the necessary follow-up. Given the consequences if an opacity was malignant, it was not too onerous to impose on specialists an obligation to schedule a follow-up to ensure the opacity was benign. However, since the nodule was likely to have been benign in November 2007, Dr Imran’s negligence had not caused any delay in diagnosing her lung cancer and the Judge’s dismissal of the appellant’s claim against Dr Imran was upheld: [85]–[89], and [104].
10        The appeal was allowed against the Judge’s finding that CGH had carried out a proper follow-up on the radiological reports. According to the doctors, radiological reports were routed back to the department which ordered it. A doctor in the department would review the report to determine whether a follow-up was necessary. Even though the April 2010 and July 2011 radiological reports recommended follow-up on the nodule, CGH did not adduce any evidence to show that an A&E doctor had reviewed the report or conducted the necessary follow-up. Hence, on a balance of probabilities, the procedure put in place was not adhered to and CGH failed to ensure proper follow-up: at [95] and [97].
11        There were also serious inadequacies in the system: 
a.         It should not be for the A&E department to review the report and to resolve all incidental findings even if it was an A&E doctor ordering the reports. Instead, the results should be routed to specific outpatient clinics better equipped with specialised knowledge and the relative luxury of time and attention: at [98].
b.         There was no appropriate mechanism for the consolidation of what was already known and this prevented the comprehensive management of a patient. Each time the appellant visited the A&E department and each time a radiological report was prepared on her nodule, it was seemingly treated as an isolated incident. If the A&E doctors had reviewed the radiological report and checked against Dr Imran’s notes, it would have been immediately obvious that the only specialist who had seen her over the past four years was mistaken in concluding that the opacity was resolving and they would, instead, have concluded that the nodule was persistent. However, the A&E doctors had no access to Dr Imran’s medical notes, and could not capture the notes of the patient’s visits to other departments and had to rely on the appellant’s own description of what the specialist had said: at [99].
c.         It is unsatisfactory that there was no system to properly record decisions made. CGH’s process for reviewing radiological reports was to send it to the A&E department, but there was no record of which A&E doctors decided against the radiologist’s recommendation to follow-up, or their reasons to not follow the radiologist’s recommendation. Such a process lacked accountability by the reviewing doctors and was unacceptable: at [100].
12        The appeal against the Judge’s finding that the nodule was benign until July 2011 was allowed. On a balance of probabilities, the appellant was suffering from lung cancer in July 2011 given the short time period between July 2011 and March 2012 when her cancer was already at Stage IIA. Her cancer would have to go through Stages IA and IB. While there was a slow rate of growth from 2007 to 2011, the nodule had grown significantly between April 2010 and July 2011: at [105], [109], and [111].
13        CGH’s negligence had caused a delay in diagnosing the appellant with lung cancer. If it were not for the delay in diagnosis, there would not have been a progression of the lung cancer from Stage I to Stage IIA, the growth of the nodule, and the spread of the cancer to her lymph node: at [117].
14        The Judge’s findings on causation were reversed and therefore the losses and damages occasioned by CGH’s breach fell to be determined and assessed. The issue of loss and damage, including quantification (if any) was remitted to the Judge with leave for parties to refine or revise their evidence as necessary: [123]–[125].
