Case Summary
Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Goel Adesh Kumar and another appeal [2018] SGCA 58 Civil Appeals Nos 127 of 2017 and 21 of 2018
_____________________________________________________________________
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Steven Chong)
Outcome: CoA orders Mr Goel Adesh Kumar, a visitor at RWS’s casino who sued RWS for injuries caused by casino security staff, to pay 80% of the costs incurred by SATS, a 3P joined by RWS, on a standard basis on the HC scale, finding that Mr Goel had wrongly sued RWS in respect of the tortious acts of SATS’s APOs; upholds HC’s order for RWS to pay Mr Goel’s costs on a standard basis on the MC scale up to date of RWS and SATS’s joint OTS and for Mr Goel to pay RWS’s costs on an indemnity basis on the HC scale from date of the OTS. 
Background
1          These were cross-appeals brought against the judgment on costs issued by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in the suit (“the Suit”) commenced by Mr Goel Adesh Kumar (“Mr Goel”) against Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd (“RWS”) following an incident at the casino operated by RWS (“the Casino”) during which Mr Goel sustained injuries. Both RWS and Mr Goel had filed appeals against different aspects of the Judge’s orders on the costs of the Suit and the third party proceedings commenced by RWS against SATS Security Services Pte Ltd (“SATS”) (“the Third Party Proceedings”). 
The material facts
2          A quarrel erupted between Mr Goel, who was visiting the Casino, and two other patrons of the Casino in the early hours of 22 April 2012. Mr Goel sustained injuries to his shoulder after being escorted into a separate room by the Casino’s security staff, comprising both RWS’s own security officers and SATS’s auxiliary police officers (“APOs”), and detained for several hours before being released (“the Incident”). 
3          On 29 May 2013, Mr Goel commenced the Suit against RWS, claiming that RWS was vicariously liable for the acts of assault, battery and wrongful imprisonment committed by both RWS’s security officers and SATS’s APOs, and that RWS was negligent in failing to keep him safe and secure during the Incident. Mr Goel sought a total claim of S$484,196.16 for, among other things, damages for the pain and suffering and loss of amenities arising from his injuries, loss of liberty, medical and transport costs, loss of pre-trial income, and aggravated and exemplary damages for RWS’s “haughty and high-handed attitude” displayed during and after the Incident. RWS joined SATS as a third party to the Suit on 19 November 2013 on the basis of a contractual indemnity provided for in an agreement between RWS and SATS. On 2 July 2014, RWS and SATS made a joint offer to fully and finally settle Mr Goel’s claim in the Suit for S$62,000, with all parties to bear their own costs (“the First Offer”). Mr Goel rejected the First Offer. RWS and SATS subsequently made a second joint offer to fully and finally settle the Suit for S$100,000, but Mr Goel also rejected this offer.
4          Following the trial of the Suit, the Judge awarded Mr Goel only S$45,915.74 in damages. The Judge held that RWS’s security officers were 80% liable and SATS’s APOs were 20% liable in respect of only the torts of wrongful imprisonment, assault and battery committed against Mr Goel. The Judge rejected the claims for damages for pre-trial loss of earnings and for aggravated and exemplary damages. The Judge found that RWS and SATS were respectively vicariously liable only for the tortious acts of their own employees. Finally, the Judge held that the Third Party Proceedings were redundant, given that RWS was vicariously liable only for the acts of its own security officers and hence there was no basis for RWS to claim an indemnity or contribution from SATS for any damages ordered against it. Mr Goel’s appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Judge’s decision on liability was dismissed on 17 August 2016.
5          The issue of costs of the Suit was remitted to the Judge. The Judge held that: (a) RWS was to pay Mr Goel’s costs of the Suit on a standard basis on the Magistrate’s Court scale up to 2 July 2014 (ie, the date of the First Offer); (b) Mr Goel was to pay RWS’s costs of the Suit on an indemnity basis on the High Court scale from 2 July 2014; and (c) RWS was to pay 80% of SATS’s costs on a standard basis on the High Court scale. RWS appealed against order (c) (“RWS’s Appeal”), while Mr Goel appealed against orders (a) and (b) (“Mr Goel’s Appeal”). 
The Court’s decision
6          The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Goel’s Appeal and allowed RWS’s Appeal: at [2] and [38].
7          Regarding Mr Goel’s Appeal, the Judge was correct to apply the general costs consequences provided for under O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). First, it was undisputed that Mr Goel had rejected the First Offer. Second, the First Offer was not withdrawn before liability in the Suit was disposed of on appeal on 17 August 2016, nor did the First Offer expire, given that the offer did not specify any time within which it had to be accepted and hence remained open for acceptance any time before the final disposal of the Suit on appeal. Third, the judgment sum of S$45,915.74 obtained by Mr Goel was not, even when taken together with the costs incurred by Mr Goel up to the date of the First Offer, more favourable than the settlement sum of S$62,000 offered in the First Offer: at [16], [18] and [19].
8          Finally, the Court saw no reason to conclude that the Judge ought to have exercised his discretion to depart from the general rule on costs provided under O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC. The First Offer was a reasonable, serious and genuine offer to settle for the purposes of O 22A of the ROC as there was a legitimate basis for the offer made and the offer was not illusory: at [20] to [22] and [25]. 
9          As regards RWS’s Appeal, Mr Goel (and not RWS) should pay 80% of SATS’s costs in the Third Party Proceedings. Mr Goel had acted improperly and unreasonably in commencing the Suit against only RWS even though it should have been plain and obvious to Mr Goel that that the specific issue in relation to the alleged tortious acts of SATS’s APOs ought to have been litigated between himself and SATS (and not between himself and RWS). It was evident from the pleadings as well as the terms of the joint offers made by RWS and SATS, that Mr Goel knew that some of the tortious acts might have been committed by two of SATS’s APOs. This was vindicated by the Judge’s finding that SATS was liable to Mr Goel, and also by Mr Goel’s failed attempt to add SATS as a co-respondent to his earlier appeal against the Judge’s decision on liability. Mr Goel, by wrongly commencing the Suit against RWS in respect of the tortious acts of SATS’s APOs, made it inevitable for RWS to commence the Third Party Proceedings against SATS: at [33] to [37].
