Case Summary
Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased) [2018] SGCA 48
Civil Appeal No 93 of 2017
____________________________________________________________________
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Andrew Phang Boon Leong)
Outcome: CoA allows appeal by the grandson of the now-deceased owner of a five-room HDB flat, granting him a higher sum of $140,000 as equitable compensation for being evicted by the deceased’s estate from the said flat despite the deceased having previously promised him a life-long licence to occupy the flat.
 
Background
1          This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to award Low Heng Leon Andy (“the Appellant”) equitable compensation in the sum of $100,000, which the Judge had assessed to be the appropriate sum to satisfy the Appellant’s equity that had arisen following his successful claim in proprietary estoppel against the estate (“the Estate”) of his grandmother (“the Deceased”). The sum awarded by the Judge was already an increase from the $84,000 awarded by the assistant registrar (“the AR”) at first instance, but the Appellant remains dissatisfied with the quantum awarded.
The material facts
2          The Appellant has, since his birth in 1984, lived in a five-room Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat located in Hougang (“the Flat”) until he was evicted by the administrator of the Estate (“the Respondent”) in July 2009. The Flat was held in joint tenancy by the Deceased and one of the Appellant’s aunts (“the Aunt”). The Aunt and the Deceased had previously moved out of the Flat in 1992, but returned to live with the Appellant in 2005. The Aunt passed away in 2007, while the Deceased passed away in 2008. This left the Estate, which the Appellant was not a beneficiary of, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Flat.
3          According to the Appellant, the Deceased had, before her passing, promised the Appellant that the Flat was not to be sold in the event of her demise, and that the Appellant would be free to continue staying in the Flat for as long as he wished. In reliance on the promises made by the Deceased, the Appellant took care of both the Aunt and the Deceased during the entire period from 2005 till their respective deaths in 2007 and 2008, and suffered from various detriments, including: (a) spending time and effort to care for the Aunt and the Deceased, and paying for all of the household and medical expenses for the Deceased; (b) refraining from seeking regular full-time employment in order to take care of the Deceased on a full-time basis; and (c) having to wrestle with the constant fear of contracting tuberculosis and feeling compelled to sacrifice his social life by avoiding social contact while taking care of the tuberculosis-stricken Deceased.
4          After being evicted in July 2009, the Appellant brought a claim in proprietary estoppel against the Estate, seeking to recover the moneys expended in taking care of the Deceased during her lifetime as well as equitable compensation for the loss of his life-long licence to reside in the Flat. In August 2016, the Appellant obtained an order for interlocutory judgment against the Estate with damages to be assessed. Before the AR, the Appellant limited his claim to only the recovery of equitable compensation for the loss of his life-long licence, which he valued at $420,000. The AR awarded the Appellant damages of $84,000. The Appellant appealed. The Judge allowed the appeal, increasing the quantum awarded to $100,000. The Appellant again appealed.
The Court’s decision
5          The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, albeit only to the extent that the equitable compensation awarded to the Appellant was increased to a sum of $140,000: at [2], [33], [62].
6          The exercise of assessing the appropriate remedy to satisfy the equity that has arisen in a proprietary estoppel claim is an intensely fact-specific one, with the court’s exercise of its discretion being ultimately guided by the twin lodestars of achieving proportionality between the expectation, the detriment and the remedy, as well as doing the minimum required to satisfy the maximum extent of the equity and do justice between the parties: at [17].
7          There are two different approaches towards assessing the appropriate remedy to satisfy the equity that has arisen in a proprietary estoppel claim – one school of thought is that the claimant’s expectation should be the starting point of the assessment exercise before the court turns to consider the detriment suffered  (ie, the expectation-based approach), while the other is that the claimant’s detriment should be the starting point before the court turns to consider the claimant’s expectation (ie, the reliance-based approach). However, in the present proceedings, the Court adopted the expectation-based approach because that was the approach that the Appellant had elected to base his case on, and the AR and the Judge had proceeded throughout on the basis of that approach: at [20], [21], [24], [27] and [31].
8          The Court also observed that the issue as to which of the two different approaches referred to in the preceding paragraph the court should focus on might represent a false dichotomy. In other words, whether the court focuses on the expectation-based approach or the reliance-based approach depends, in the final analysis, on the particular choice made by the plaintiff. The legal principles summarised in paragraph 6 above, therefore, relate instead to the legal relationship between these two approaches – and not the starting-point that ought to be adopted by the court as such. However, as the Court was not addressed on this issue, this view is only tentative in nature: at [28] to [31].
9          Applying the legal principles to the facts, the Court affirmed the methodology employed by the Judge, which was to first identify a suitable multiplicand to be multiplied by a suitable multiplier in order to arrive at an amount that fulfils the Appellant’s expectation, and then consider whether this amount should be reduced to ensure the proportionality of the remedy with the detriment suffered: at [34].
10        The amount that would fulfil the Appellant’s expectation should have been obtained by multiplying the multiplicand of $1,500 per month by a multiplier of ten years, which would give us a total sum of $180,000. A multiplicand of $1,500 per month was based on the tenancy arrangements for three-room or four-room HDB flats that the Appellant had in fact entered into post-eviction, which were an appropriate proxy for the losses arising out of the Appellant’s unmet expectation of living in a furnished flat. A multiplier of ten years took into account both the Appellant’s expectation of a life-long licence to occupy the Flat as well as his self-professed intention to reside in the Flat only up till when he is first eligible to apply for public housing as a single (at the age of 35): at [35], [38], [39], [43], [45].
11        The detriment suffered by the Appellant was, on the whole, more significant than what the Judge had assessed it to be. The Judge had correctly taken into account the feeble state of the evidence adduced in respect of the medical and household expenses that the Appellant claimed to have borne on behalf of the Deceased, the complete lack of evidence regarding the full-time employment opportunities that the Appellant had allegedly forgone in order to take care of the Deceased on a full-time basis, as well as the fact that the Appellant had received assistance from a domestic helper when looking after the Aunt and the Deceased. But some value ought to have been ascribed to the non-financial detriment suffered by the Appellant from having to wrestle with the constant fear of contracting tuberculosis and having to sacrifice his social life while taking care of the Deceased. The Judge also should not have offset the aforementioned detriment suffered against the rent-free accommodation that the Appellant had enjoyed at the material time: at [48], [60].
12        Accordingly, the provisional figure of $180,000 was out of all proportion to the detriment that the Appellant had suffered, and should be reduced to the sum of $140,000 in order to achieve proportionality between the expectation of the Appellant and his detriment suffered, and ensure that the Court does the minimum necessary to satisfy the maximum extent of the equity and do justice between the parties: at [47], [61].
