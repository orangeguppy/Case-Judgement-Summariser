MEDIA SUMMARY
Pua Hung Jaan Jeffrey Nguyen v Public Prosecutor 
Magistrate’s Appeal No 9043 of 2017/01 
Decision of the High Court (delivered by
Sundaresh Menon CJ)
1                   
The appellant, Pua Hung Jaan Jeffrey Nguyen (the
“Appellant”), pleaded guilty to a single charge of driving while having
excessive alcohol in his breath or blood under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (the “RTA”). The
district judge (the “District Judge”) sentenced him to one week’s imprisonment
and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences
for a period of 30 months with effect from the date of release.

Magistrate’s Appeal No 9043 of
2017/01 was the Appellant’s appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the
District Judge. It was opposed by the respondent, the Public Prosecutor (the
“Respondent”). What stood out on the facts was the Appellant’s previous
conviction, in 2012, for an offence of being in charge of a motor vehicle while
under the influence of drink under s 68(1)(b) of the RTA. The central question that
was raised was whether the custodial threshold had been crossed.
Background to the appeal 
3                   
The Appellant, an American
citizen and Singapore permanent resident, was 34 years old at the time of the
offence. At about 4.50am on 29 October 2016, the Appellant was driving his car
along Whitley Road when he was stopped at a police road block. The Appellant
smelt strongly of alcohol. A breathalyser test was administered and the
Appellant’s alcohol level was found to be excessive. He was placed under arrest
and escorted to the Traffic Police department for a Breath Evidential Analyser
(“BEA”) test. The BEA test revealed that the proportion of alcohol in the
Appellant’s breath was 70μg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. This far exceeded
the prescribed limit of 35μg of alcohol per 100ml of breath set out in s
72(1) of the RTA. Investigations revealed that the Appellant had been at the
Pan Pacific Hotel at about 11.00pm on 28 October 2016, where he had consumed
about three glasses of champagne.
Decision on appeal 
4                   
The court held that the
starting point of the analysis was the fact that imprisonment was not mandatory
in what it termed “Scenario 4”. Scenario 4 was the scenario where an offender
with an antecedent under s 68(1) of the RTA was subsequently convicted under s
67(1) of the RTA. It was also the scenario within which the present case fell.
A sentencing court faced with a Scenario 4 offender had a choice whether to
impose a fine and a period of disqualification or a term of imprisonment and a
period of disqualification. Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor [2013] 4 SLR 1139 and then enhance the sentence derived from that
framework to take account of the Appellant’s antecedent. ([8]–[9] and [52])
5                   
The court noted that the
difficulty with that and, in a sense, the strongest point in the Respondent’s
favour, was the comparison which Scenario 4 invited with what the court termed
“Scenario 2”. Scenario 2 was the scenario where an offender with an antecedent
under s 68(1) of the RTA was subsequently convicted under the same provision.
The court observed that there was attraction in the notion that the statutory
framework in respect of offences under ss 67(1) and
68(1) of the RTA could not be ignored and should be taken into account. In this
context, a comparison with Scenario 2 pointed towards the imposition of a
custodial sentence in the present case. In particular, the court noted that it was
somewhat anomalous that imprisonment was mandatory in Scenario 2 but not in
Scenario 4, even though, all other things being equal, a Scenario 4 offender
would generally be more culpable than a Scenario 2 offender. This was because
the second offence in Scenario 4 (which was an offence under s 67(1) of the
RTA) was a more serious offence than the second offence in Scenario 2 (which was
an offence under s 68(1) of the RTA). Thus, if a custodial sentence were the
starting point in Scenario 4, this might go some way towards alleviating this
anomaly. ([8]–[9], [38] and [53])
6                   
However, the court emphasised
that in fact imprisonment was not mandatory in Scenario 4. The court held that
it would not be correct for the courts to regard a custodial sentence as the
starting point in Scenario 4. To do so would come dangerously close to
regarding imprisonment as mandatory in Scenario 4 when the current statutory
framework did not require this. Although this anomaly was likely to have been
the result of legislative oversight, the court did not think that it would be
appropriate to adopt a rectifying construction against the Appellant when what was
in question was a penal provision, and when there was an absence of clear
evidence of Parliament’s intent. ([54])
7                   
In addition, the court observed
that the precedents cited by the Appellant involving two charges under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA
being prosecuted at the same hearing also pointed strongly against the
imposition of a custodial sentence. The court saw neither reason nor basis for
imposing a custodial sentence in the present case when a non-custodial sentence
was imposed in respect of the later offence in these precedents, even though
they were more aggravated. Moreover, this had not only been the sentencing
practice of the courts; it also appeared to have been the practice of the
Respondent to not seek a custodial sentence in such cases. ([56])
8                   
Given that imprisonment was not
mandatory in Scenario 4, the court took the view that to determine whether the
custodial threshold had been crossed, it had to consider the facts and
circumstances of the present Scenario 4 case rather than the sentence
prescribed for some other combination of offences. The court held that in the
present case, the degree of harm caused and the Appellant’s culpability pointed
against the imposition of a custodial sentence, and that this ultimately tilted
the balance in favour of the Appellant. There was no actual harm caused by the
offence as the Appellant had been apprehended in the course of a road block and,
while the Appellant’s alcohol level was certainly on the high side, there was
no evidence that the manner of his driving was particularly dangerous. ([49] and [57])
9                   
In the circumstances, the court
allowed the appeal. The court set aside the sentence of one week’s imprisonment
imposed by the District Judge and substituted this with the maximum fine of
$5,000. The period of disqualification was to remain, except that it was to
take effect immediately. ([59])
