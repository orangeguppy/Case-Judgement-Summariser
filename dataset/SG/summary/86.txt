SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE7 November 2023Case summaryLaw Society of Singapore v de Souza Christopher James [2023] SGHC 318Originating Application No 7 of 2022--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Outcome: The Court of Three Supreme Court Judges (the “C3J”) dismisses the Law Society of Singapore (“Law Society”)’s application under s 98 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) for the respondent, Mr Christopher James de Souza (“Mr de Souza”) to be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the LPA for breaching r 10(3)(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “PCR”).Grounds of Decision of the majority consisting of Belinda Ang Saw Ean JCA and Woo Bih Li JAD (delivered by Belinda Ang Saw Ean JCA):Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  Intention was a necessary ingredient of the fourth charge the Law Society preferred against Mr de Souza (“Fourth Charge”). The Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) erred in its analysis by treating the question of intent as irrelevant: at [75]–[77].•  Section 86(8) of the LPA permits an Inquiry Committee to investigate matters outside the scope of the original complaint which arise in the course of its inquiry, subject to the requirement that the legal practitioner be informed in the manner and to the extent prescribed by s 86(6) of the LPA of the allegation he has to answer: at [146].Background facts 1 At the material time during which the following events took place, Mr de Souza was a legal practitioner practising with and a partner of Messrs Lee & Lee (“L&L”): at [7].2 Amber Compounding Pharmacy Pte Ltd and Amber Laboratories Pte Ltd (collectively, “Amber”) are companies in the specialised trade of compounding medical and pharmaceutical products. On 14 February 2018, Amber commenced HC/S 164/2018 (“Suit 164”) against six defendants (“Defendants”). These included Ms Priscilla Lim Suk Ling (“Ms Lim”) and UrbanRX Compounding Pharmacy Pte Ltd (“UrbanRX”), a company in the same business as Amber. In Suit 164, Amber essentially claimed that the Defendants misappropriated Amber’s confidential information and/or trade secrets for UrbanRx’s benefit: at [8]–[9].3 Amber was, at first instance, represented by Mr Alfred Dodwell (“Mr Dodwell”) of Dodwell & Co LLC. L&L took over conduct of Suit 164 on 14 December 2018. Ms Lim and UrbanRX were represented by Mr George Barnabas Pereira (“Mr Pereira”) of Pereira & Tan LLC at all material times: at [10].4 On 15 March 2018, Amber applied for ex parte search orders against Ms Lim and UrbanRX. On 3 April 2018, the High Court Judge (the “Judge”) who heard the ex parte application ordered Ms Lim and UrbanRX to disclose to Amber all email correspondence on their email accounts, all data processing devices, and all documents relating to the trade secrets and/or confidential and/or proprietary information of Amber (“Search Order(s)”): at [11]–[12].5 Pertinently, in applying for the Search Orders, Amber expressly undertook not to “use any information or documents obtained as a result of the carrying out of [the] Order except for the purposes of these proceedings or to inform anyone else of these proceedings until the trial or further order” (“Search Order Undertaking”): at [13].6 The Search Orders were executed on 17 April 2018 in the presence of Ms Lim and a supervising solicitor. More than 100,000 documents were seized: at [15].7 On 10 May 2018, Ms Lim and UrbanRX filed HC/SUM 2169/2018 (“SUM 2169”) to set aside the Search Orders. They asked for the Search Orders to be discharged and for Amber to return all seized items as well as destroy all copies of items made during the searches: at [16].8 At a Judge Pre-Trial Conference (“JPTC”) held on 23 May 2018, the Judge fixed timelines for the filing of affidavits and submissions in relation to SUM 2169 and directed Parties to sort out the documents that clearly belonged to either Amber or the Defendants: at [17].9 What followed was a letter from Dodwell & Co LLC to Pereira & Tan LLC dated 31 May 2018, in which Mr Dodwell agreed to hand over copies of the original documents taken from Ms Lim and UrbanRX’s premises on condition that Mr Pereira undertake that the documents are provided for the purpose of Suit 164 and will not be handed over to the Defendants and/or any third parties. At page 3 of this letter, Mr Pereira and Mr Dodwell exchanged signed express undertakings not to hand over the seized documents to their respective clients and/or any other third party and/or any other solicitor: at [18].10 A further JPTC was held on 4 June 2018. On this occasion, Mr Dodwell informed the Judge that he had exchanged the solicitors’ undertaking set out in the 31 May 2018 letter with Mr Pereira. The Judge directed Amber and the Defendants to come to a workable solution to sort out ownership of the documents: at [19].11 The Parties returned before the Judge on 18 July 2018, whereupon the Judge ordered them to carry out a “Listing Exercise”. This exercise first enjoined Amber to determine the ownership of the documents based on 32 search terms by 8 August 2018 and provide a list of these documents to the Defendants by 22 August 2018. Thereafter, both counsel were to agree on which documents belonged to Amber and the Defendants respectively, with disputed documents to be listed separately by 5 September 2018. Documents which undisputedly belonged to Amber or the Defendants were to be returned to their rightful owners and deleted/destroyed by the other party by 12 September 2018. Documents which were in the disputed list were to be retained by the Defendants’ counsel (and were not to be kept by any party) by 17 September 2018: at [20].12 The Listing Exercise was not completed by the stipulated dates. At a further JPTC held on 28 September 2018, the Judge extended the relevant timelines and the entire exercise was now to be completed by 16 November 2018: at [21].13 Whilst conducting the Listing Exercise, Amber purportedly formed the view that certain documents showed that Ms Lim and/or UrbanRX had committed offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”), the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”), the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed), and the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CMA”) (“Documents”). Spurred by the view that the Defendants had committed serious offences and allegedly out of civic-mindedness, Amber’s representative, Mr Samuel Sudesh Thaddaeus (“Mr Sudesh”) made reports to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) and the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) (collectively, “Authorities”) on 31 July 2018, 20 October 2018 and 22 October 2018 respectively (collectively, “Reports”). As it transpired later in July 2019, Mr Sudesh had used ten of the Documents to make his complaints to the Authorities. These reports were made whilst Amber was represented by Dodwell & Co LLC and in breach of Amber’s Search Order Undertaking: at [22]–[23].14 Separately, on 29 November 2018, Amber instructed L&L to prepare and lodge reports with law enforcement and regulatory agencies as it believed that its confidential information had been stolen by the Defendants. In this connection, Amber sent L&L the Reports on 30 November 2018: at [24].15 On 3 December 2018, whilst reviewing the various documents Amber had sent L&L (which included the Reports), an Associate in the L&L team, Mr Chew Zhi Xuan (“Mr Chew”), suspected that Amber had disclosed the information contained in the Documents or the Documents to the Authorities without leave of the court and in breach of its Riddick Undertaking. He emailed Mr de Souza to inform him of the same. In response, Mr de Souza instructed the L&L team to “halt work” via email on the same day, and repeated this instruction in a separate email dated 4 December 2018: at [25].16 On 5 December 2018, the L&L team emailed Mr Sudesh and stated that it was important for them to understand “which of the evidence used for the [Reports] was obtained through the [Search Orders]”. Later that same day, Mr Sudesh’s position in his reply email was that there “ha[d] been no use of any [Search Order] evidence documents” and the only information reported to the Authorities are “from [his] notes on suspect conversations, suspects involved and open court documents”: at [26].17 Next, on 14 December 2018, Amber appointed L&L as its legal representative in Suit 164. As a result, L&L gained access to the online data room which stored the documents which were the subject of the Listing Exercise on 18 December 2018. Two days later (ie, 20 December 2018), the L&L team formed the view that Amber had in fact made use of some of the Documents in making the Reports in breach of its Riddick Undertaking. L&L and Mr Sudesh then corresponded on the issue of Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking between 20 December 2018 and 23 January 2019: at [27]–[28].18 A Pre-Trial Conference was held before a Senior Assistant Registrar on 23 January 2019 (“23/1/19 PTC”) because the Defendants took the view that Amber had not complied with the Judge’s timelines in relation to the Listing Exercise, and wanted a penal notice to be inserted at the end of a draft order for SUM 2169. At this PTC, Mr de Souza informed the SAR that Amber’s persistent failure to comply with the Listing Exercise timelines was due to the “sheer number of documents involved”. It was not disputed that L&L did not mention Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking during this PTC: at [29]–[30].19 Further to the SAR’s directions, L&L wrote a letter to Pereira & Tan LLC dated 25 January 2019 (“25/1/19 Letter”) to seek its consent for an extension of time for the Listing Exercise to be completed by 5 April 2019. This letter made no mention of the fact that various Search Order documents had been used in making the Reports without leave of court: at [31].20 Subsequently, on 29 January 2019, Amber filed HC/SUM 484/2019 (“SUM 484”) ex parte. By SUM 484, Amber applied for orders that documents it had obtained under the Search Orders be preserved and it be entitled to use the said documents to make reports to law enforcement agencies. Mr Sudesh affirmed an affidavit dated 29 January 2019 (“Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit”) in support of Amber’s application. It was undisputed that Mr de Souza was involved in the preparation of Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit and also personally made final amendments to paragraph 24 thereof: at [32].21 Pereira & Tan LLC replied to the 25/1/19 Letter on 31 January 2019 to agree to the extension of time sought on behalf of Amber. At the time consent was given, Pereira & Tan LLC had no inkling that SUM 484 was filed two days earlier on 29 January 2019: at [33].22 The hearing for SUM 484 was fixed for 13 May 2019. On 1 February 2019, L&L wrote to the court to request “an urgent hearing date” in view of “the urgency of the subject matter of the Summons which involve[d] the potential commission of criminal offences and which necessitated it being filed on an ex-parte basis”. It separately wrote to the court on 7 February 2019 to seek its approval of the extended timelines of the Listing Exercises parties had agreed to: at [34].23 In a response conveyed on 8 February 2019, the Judge granted Amber an extension of time to comply with the terms of the Listing Exercise in the terms sought by the parties and in view of the parties’ agreement. The Judge also directed on the same day that the SUM 484 hearing date of 13 May 2019 was to stand, and Amber was to serve SUM 484 and Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit on the Defendants by 13 February 2019: at [35].24 Amber served the documents on the Defendants on 12 February 2019. This was when the Defendants first learnt that Amber had used and intended to use the Documents for the extraneous purpose of making criminal reports to the authorities. Consequently, Ms Lim and UrbanRX filed HC/SUM 1094/2019 (“SUM 1094”) on 4 March 2019 to set aside the extension of the Listing Exercise timelines the Judge had granted parties on 28 September 2018. SUM 1094 was nevertheless eventually withdrawn on 22 March 2019 with costs to be paid by Ms Lim and UrbanRX: at [36].25 Separately, Ms Lim filed a reply affidavit in SUM 484 on behalf of herself and UrbanRX on 11 March 2019, and Mr Sudesh filed a further affidavit dated 25 March 2019 (“Sudesh’s 25/3/19 Affidavit”) to respond to Ms Lim’s affidavit of 11 March 2019: at [37]–[38].26 The Judge first heard parties on SUM 484 on 8 April 2019. On this occasion, the Judge directed Amber to set out how each document it sought permission to disclose to the Authorities “relate[d] to the specific offences” allegedly committed by the Defendants, and to consider paring down the number of documents Amber “intend[ed] to use to report to the authorities”. At the hearing, based on Mr Sudesh’s position to L&L, Mr de Souza informed the court that in making the Reports, Amber “ha[d] only quoted certain WhatsApp messages and other information which he gleaned from the documents” and “did not hand over any of the documents to the authorities”: at [39].27 Amber filed supplementary written submissions on 29 April 2019, and parties returned for a hearing before the Judge on 24 June 2019. This time, Mr de Souza stated that he “[did not] disagree” that he had advised Amber to take out SUM 484 because it had breached its Search Order Undertaking. He also clarified that Amber was seeking “both retrospective and prospective” leave to disclose the Documents, and he had yet to identify which documents had “already been given to the authorities”. The Judge directed Amber to file an affidavit stating which documents had already been disclosed to the Authorities, and adjourned the matter for decision. Mr Sudesh filed an affidavit on behalf of Amber as directed. This was dated 8 July 2019 (“Sudesh’s 8/7/19 Affidavit”): at [40]–[41].28 The Judge rendered her decision in SUM 484 on 30 October 2019, and furnished her full grounds of decision on 19 November 2019. By the earlier of these dates, L&L had ceased to act for Amber as L&L had discharged itself as Amber’s solicitors on 4 September 2019. In short, the Judge sanctioned the retrospective and prospective disclosure of the documents pertaining to the Defendants’ possible commission of offences under the EFMA (“EFMA Documents”) to the Authorities. The Judge did not grant Amber leave to disclose documents purportedly connected to other offences (“Other Documents”): at [42].29 Both parties appealed against the Judge’s decision. L&L was no longer solicitors on record in Suit 164 and Amber was represented by Allen & Gledhill LLP. The Court of Appeal (“CA”) dismissed Amber’s appeal for leave to disclose the Other Documents, and reversed the Judge’s decision to grant Amber retrospective and prospective leave to disclose the EFMA Documents to the Authorities. On the evidence before it, the CA was satisfied that Amber’s application in SUM 484 was motivated by an improper purpose: at [43]–[44].30 In the wake of the CA’s decision, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court (“DR”) referred information touching upon the conduct of Mr de Souza to the Law Society on behalf of the CA under s 85(3)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) via a letter dated 9 September 2020 (“Referral Letter”): at [46].31 An IC was constituted on 13 January 2021. In its report dated 13 July 2021, the IC found that Mr de Souza’s failure to inform the court of Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking at the 23/1/19 PTC was not borne of a desire to mislead the court and thus did not amount to a breach of r 9(2)(a)(i) of the PCR. It likewise found there to be no evidence that Mr de Souza knowingly misled or attempted to mislead Mr Pereira in breach of rr 9(2)(a)(iii) and 9(2)(a)(iv) of the PCR, and did not find rr 9(3)(b)(i) and 10(3)(a) of the PCR to be engaged on the facts. Notwithstanding the above, the IC found that Mr de Souza failed to place his duty to the court above his duty to his clients because he ought, at the very least, to have informed the court at the 23/1/19 PTC that he had “advised [Amber] that an urgent leave application in relation to the seized documents was necessary” and did not do so. In the circumstances, the IC found Mr de Souza guilty of misconduct under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA and suggested that he be fined $2,000. The IC did not consider it necessary for a DT to be convened: at [48]–[52].32 The Council of the Law Society disagreed with the IC’s findings. Pursuant to s 87(2)(b) of the LPA, and on 5 November 2021, it sought the appointment of a disciplinary tribunal to formally investigate Mr de Souza’s conduct. The DT was formally appointed on 19 November 2021. The Law Society preferred five charges, each with alternative charges, against Mr de Souza. The DT found Mr de Souza guilty only of the Fourth Charge. This averred that Mr de Souza was a party to and assisted Amber in suppressing evidence in breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR because he had prepared and filed Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit without exhibiting the Reports nor supporting documents made to certain agencies by Amber which, if exhibited in Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit, would have revealed that Amber had breached its Search Order Undertaking. The DT further found that Mr de Souza’s breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR amounted to improper conduct and practice and constituted a breach of sufficient gravity for him to show cause before this court: at [53]–[55], [60]–[63].Issues to be determined33 The main issues which arose for this court’s determination were whether the Fourth Charge was made out; and if the Fourth Charge was made out, whether due cause was shown under s 83 of the LPA. The first issue involved the resolution of several sub-issues, namely: (a) whether intention was a necessary ingredient of the Fourth Charge and if so, whether the DT erred in its analysis by treating the question of intent as irrelevant; (b) if intention was a crucial element of the Fourth Charge, whether Mr de Souza’s alleged omissions as identified and framed in the Fourth Charge were borne of an intent to assist Amber suppress its breach of the Search Order Undertaking from the court; and (c) whether Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit had suppressed Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking from the court. There was also the issue of whether the Fourth Charge was defective because it had deviated from the substance of concern expressed by the DR on behalf of the CA in the Referral Letter: at [70]–[71].DecisionWhether the Fourth Charge was made out34 Intention was a necessary ingredient of the Fourth Charge. The Fourth Charge was highly specific. It accused Mr de Souza of both being a party to and assisting Amber to suppress its breach of its Search Order Undertaking from the court. A high degree of participation in Amber’s suppression of evidence was alleged on Mr de Souza’s part. Moreover, Mr de Souza was said to have been a party to and assisted Amber in its suppression of evidence because he had failed to exhibit the Reports and the relevant supporting documents in Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit. It was the Law Society’s case that Mr de Souza was aware of Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking by the time he prepared and filed Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit and further, chose to omit the Reports and the supporting documents from Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit because he wanted to bolster Amber’s chances of obtaining an order in terms in SUM 484. Such alleged conduct was inherently goal-oriented and intentional: at [75].35 The Law Society therefore had to not only prove that Amber had suppressed its breach of its Search Order Undertaking from the court because it did not exhibit the Reports nor supporting documents to Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit, but that Mr de Souza omitted these documents from Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit because he had intended to assist Amber suppress the breach from the court to obtain a favourable outcome for Amber: at [76].36 The DT erred in its analysis of the Fourth Charge by treating the question of intent as irrelevant. Its analysis of the Fourth Charge was incomplete. The DT held that once a legal practitioner had actual knowledge that material facts had to be disclosed to the court and judged objectively, these facts were not disclosed, a legal practitioner acts in breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR. The DT ought to have considered whether the non-disclosure of the Reports as exhibits was intentionally facilitated by Mr de Souza: at [77].37 The DT fell into this error by conflating a legal practitioner’s duty not to be a party to and assist his client to suppress evidence from the court under r 10(3)(a) of the PCR with his duty under r 9(3)(b)(i) of the PCR, which the DT considered had in turn embodied the common law duty to make F&F disclosure especially in ex parte applications: at [78]–[90].Whether Mr de Souza’s alleged omissions as identified and framed in the Fourth Charge were borne of an intent to assist Amber suppress its breach of the Search Order Undertaking from the court38 There was no evidence that Mr de Souza intended to assist Amber to suppress its breach of the Search Order Undertaking from the court by the alleged omissions identified and framed in the Fourth Charge. On the contrary, Mr de Souza and the L&L team consistently intended to disclose Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking to the court and stuck to this intention in the face of an intransigent client. This was supported by the drafting history of Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit: at [91]–[108].39 In support of his argument that Mr de Souza bore the requisite intent to assist Amber to suppress its breach of the Search Order Undertaking from the court, counsel for the Law Society, Mr Assomull, relied on the CA’s observations at [96] of Amber (CA) that “Amber did not disclose any of the [Reports]” in its various affidavits and that “[s]uch reports would have revealed what was in fact disclosed to the authorities”. The court found reliance on [96] of Amber (CA) to be misguided. The context in which the CA had made these observations had to be borne in mind. The CA was concerned that SUM 484 was a smokescreen for Amber to buy itself more time to review the documents subject of the Listing Exercise for the purpose of making reports to the Authorities. If the relevant concern was that SUM 484 was Amber’s ploy for more time to review the Search Order documents, the fact that no Reports were annexed to Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit naturally assumed especial importance. Once it was appreciated that SUM 484 was not an application taken out for this improper purpose, Mr de Souza’s omission to annex the Reports to Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit diminished in significance: at [109]–[111].40 The court also did not consider the fact that Mr de Souza filed SUM 484 ex parte, failed to inform the court of Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking at the 23/1/19 PTC, sought Mr Pereira’s consent to an extension of time for the Listing Exercise via the 25/1/19 Letter whilst keeping him in the dark as to Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking, described Amber’s breach as an “alleged breach” in Sudesh’s 25/3/19 Affidavit and failed to disclose Amber’s breach of the Search Order Undertaking in Sudesh’s 8/7/19 Affidavit as evidence of the requisite intent. These instances had to be understood and viewed in context: at [117]–[126].Whether Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit suppressed Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking from the court41 The court did not find that Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit suppressed Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking. It was important to remember that the Search Order Undertaking prohibited the use of both information gathered from the search documents and the dissemination of the Search Order documents and Mr Sudesh’s consistent position was that he had merely disclosed information contained in the Documents to the Authorities: at [127]–[129].42 Whilst the Fourth Charge was directed at the fact that the Reports and the supporting documents made to the Authorities were not annexed to Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit, the more important question was whether the body of Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit had already revealed Amber’s breach of its Search Order Undertaking arising from the use of information contained in the Documents to make the Reports. If it did, the omission to exhibit the Reports was not critical: at [131].43 The majority found that Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit sufficiently admitted that Amber had made use of prior information from the Documents in breach of its Search Order Undertaking to the court. In this manner, it disclosed Amber’s prior breach of its Search Order Undertaking to the court such that this fact could not, in any event, have been said to be suppressed from the court: at [132]–[139].Whether the Fourth Charge was defective because it had deviated from the substance of concern expressed by the DR on behalf of the CA in the Referral Letter44 The court did not find that Fourth Charge was defective because the Referral Letter had not raised any concerns that evidence had been suppressed in SUM 484, but only queried if Amber had sought an extension of time to complete the Listing Exercise for an extraneous purpose: at [140].45 Even as the principal concern conveyed by the DR to the Law Society in the Referral Letter was that Amber had sought extensions of time to complete the Listing Exercise for an extraneous purpose with the benefit of legal advice, there is nothing in the LPA which restricts the subject matter of disciplinary proceedings made against the legal practitioner exclusively to the matters set out in s 86(6)(a) of the LPA. On the contrary, s 86(8) of the LPA permits an IC to investigate matters outside the scope of the original complaint which arise in the course of its inquiry. Whilst this power is subject to the requirement that the legal practitioner be informed in the manner and to the extent prescribed by s 86(6) of the LPA of the allegation he has to answer, these requirements were complied with vis-à-vis the Fourth Charge: at [141]–[150].Concurring judgment (delivered by Kannan Ramesh JAD):Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The meaning of suppression of evidence, for the purpose of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR, was always contextual depending on the nature and purpose of the proceedings in which the suppression of evidence was alleged to have taken place and the relevant law that applied to those proceedings: at [161].•  Suppression of evidence was where a litigant deliberately (or possibly recklessly) omitted to disclose information that he was under a duty to place before the court. An innocent omission to disclose evidence that one was under a duty to disclose was still wrong, but it was not suppression. Where a practitioner was charged with not preventing, being a party to, or assisting with, his client’s suppression of evidence, there had to be some subjective intention or deliberateness on the part of the practitioner: at [163], [165] and [166].•  Where a practitioner deliberately assisted with his client’s intentional failure to give full and frank disclosure in an ex parte application, or his client’s intentional failure to comply with any other obligations to disclose material facts, it had to be said that the practitioner assisted with his client's suppression of evidence: at [183].Decision46 The meaning of suppression of evidence, for the purpose of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR, was always contextual depending on the nature and purpose of the proceedings in which the suppression of evidence was alleged to have taken place and the relevant law that applied to those proceedings. In this case, the proceeding in question was SUM 484. SUM 484 was an ex parte application brought for two purposes, both of which related to the release of Amber’s obligations under the Search Order Undertaking: at [161].47 Suppression of evidence was where a litigant deliberately (or possibly recklessly) omitted to disclose information that he was under a duty to place before the court. An innocent omission to disclose evidence that one was under a duty to disclose was still wrong, but it was not suppression. Where a practitioner was charged with not preventing, being a party to, or assisting with, his client’s suppression of evidence, there had to be some subjective intention or deliberateness on the part of the practitioner: at [163], [165] and [166].48 In this regard, the DT’s analysis was erroneous. The DT concluded that it would not have been a defence to the Fourth Charge for Mr de Souza to prove that he genuinely believed that Amber had fulfilled its duty to disclose the material facts. This could not be the correct conclusion: at [167].Was there wrongful non-disclosure by Amber in SUM 484?49 In the Fourth Charge, Mr de Souza was charged with being a party to, and assisting in, Amber’s suppression of evidence, which he was able to prevent, by preparing and filing Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit which did not exhibit the Reports nor their supporting documents, the exhibition of which would have revealed that Amber had breached the Search Order Undertaking, namely by making the Reports with their supporting documents. While the Fourth Charge alleged that Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit failed to disclose the breach of the Search Order Undertaking, it did not stop there. It contextualised that failure against the failure to disclose the Reports and their supporting documents tying the former to the latter. This was important and had to be recognised when analysing the nature of the complaint in the Fourth Charge.  Reading each in isolation would not be assessing the Fourth Charge holistically and correctly: at [171].50 In essence, the complaint in the Fourth Charge was therefore that Amber did not make full disclosure of the breach of the Search Order Undertaking which it would have done if the Reports and their supporting documents had been exhibited to Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit. This was consistent with SUM 484 (which was also referenced in the Fourth Charge) being an ex parte application for retrospective and prospective leave for use of documents and information subject to the Search Order Undertaking, which carried with it the duty of full and frank disclosure of the breach of the Search Order Undertaking: at [172].51 The court determined what Amber was required to disclose in SUM 484 by having reference to: (a) the purpose of SUM 484; (b) the nature of SUM 484 and the relevant law; and (c) the way SUM 484 was framed. SUM 484 was an application for both retrospective and prospective leave to use the Documents. Amber’s prior breach of the Search Order Undertaking would have been of utmost relevance to the court’s decision to grant retrospective and prospective leave. SUM 484 was an ex parte application, and Amber was subject to a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts. Finally, a request for both retrospective and prospective leave was said to have been contained in SUM 484, but it was difficult if not impossible to tell from the prayers alone that this was the case. If the prayers of SUM 484 did not make clear that retrospective leave was sought and what it was sought in respect of, it was imperative that Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit did: at [174]–[178].52 Accordingly, revealing that Amber had breached the Search Order Undertaking entailed more than just revealing that a breach had occurred. That was not the essence of the complaint in the Fourth Charge. Without reference to Amber’s duty in SUM 484, it was not possible to explain why Amber’s failure to reveal to the court the fact of its breach of the Search Order Undertaking could amount to suppression of evidence. Once one referred to the duty that Amber was subject to in SUM 484, it became clear that revealing the extent of breach was necessary: at [181].53 While the language used in the Fourth Charge could be said to imply that the alleged wrongful non-disclosure was merely the fact of Amber’s breach, such a reading was inconsistent with a holistic reading of the Fourth Charge. It was also inconsistent with the gravamen of the Fourth Charge, as determined by reference to the nature, purpose and manner of SUM 484: at [184].54 It was also significant that Mr de Souza did not read the Fourth Charge so narrowly. He did not take the position that he did not need to disclose how Amber had breached the Search Order Undertaking. He did not assert that it was adequate for him to merely disclose the fact of breach. In essence, his position was that Amber had disclosed how it had breached the Search Order Undertaking: at [185].55 Thus, for Amber to be considered to have disclosed that it had breached the Search Order Undertaking, Amber had to have revealed not just the fact that it had breached the Search Order Undertaking but how it had breached it. That was the gravamen of the Fourth Charge. It followed that, if Amber failed to reveal to what extent it had breached the Search Order Undertaking in Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit, the “wrongful non-disclosure” element of the Fourth Charge would have been made out against Mr de Souza: at [188].56 It was not simply the case that Amber used the Documents in the sense that it was prompted by information contained therein to make the Reports. Amber also used the Documents by actually disclosing excerpts to the Authorities in support of the Reports. This was a fundamental aspect of how Amber breached the Search Order Undertaking, and this had to be revealed to the court. Mr de Souza was acutely aware of the need to disclose this fact and his consistent position throughout the disciplinary proceedings was that Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit did disclose this fact: at [189]–[192].57 The relevant paragraphs of Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit might have disclosed the fact that there had been a prior breach of the Search Order Undertaking by Amber in the sense that it disclosed that: (a) the Reports had already been made; and (b) Mr Sudesh had been prompted by information gathered from the Documents to make the Reports. However, Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit did not reveal the true nature of Amber’s breach. It did not reveal that excerpts of Documents had been disclosed to the Authorities and to what extent: at [198]–[199].58 Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit was lacking in a material respect and conveyed an incomplete picture to the court. That was what the Fourth Charge was about. Whether this amounted to suppression of evidence, and whether Mr de Souza could be said to have assisted in such suppression, depended on his subjective intention when preparing and filing Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit: at [207].Did Mr de Souza intend to assist Amber with suppressing evidence?59 On the evidence, it was accepted that Mr de Souza believed that Amber had effectively disclosed what it needed to disclose via Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit: at [209]. 60 Mr de Souza did not intend to obscure the fact that excerpts of the Documents had been disclosed to the Authorities. He was aware that this was something that had to be disclosed by Amber and he resisted an attempt by Mr Sudesh to introduce a line that would convey the wrong impression in this regard. Mr de Souza failed to realise that L&L’s own version of the relevant paragraph also conveyed the wrong impression. This was an oversight, and a serious one. However, there was far from sufficient evidence to show beyond reasonable doubt that Mr de Souza knew that the final version of Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit conveyed this wrong impression, and that he filed Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit despite this knowledge. Without this, it could not be said that Mr de Souza intended to assist or be party to Amber’s suppression of evidence, which he was able to prevent: at [220].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
