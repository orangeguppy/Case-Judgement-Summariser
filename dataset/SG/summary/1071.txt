SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE30 December 2021Case summaryPublic Prosecutor v Takaaki Masui and another and other matters [2021] SGCA 119 Criminal Reference No 3 of 2020 and Criminal Motions Nos 1 and 2 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Steven Chong):Outcome: Court of Appeal reduces the penalty payable by each of two offenders who were convicted of corruption offences from $1,004,716.50 to $904,716.50.Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The legislative purpose of s 13(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 231, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) is to prevent corrupt recipients from retaining their ill-gotten gains (at [85], [91], [92], [107], [116] and [140]). •  Among the interests of the State, the giver, the recipient and the principal, the principal’s interest in recovery assumes primacy, and the law should incentivise the recipient to repay the principal (at [106], [109], [112], [117] and [122]). •  Where the gratification is a sum of money, the court should not order the recipient to pay a penalty under s 13 of the PCA of a sum equivalent to the amount of money received by him, if: (a) he has returned or repaid all or part of the sum of money; and/or (b) all or part of the sum of money has been disgorged from him, whether voluntarily or otherwise (at [87], [95], [139] and [148]). The quantification of the penalty will depend on the precise circumstances of the repayment or disgorgement (at [139] and [148]).Background facts1 Katsutoshi Ishibe (“Ishibe”) and Takaaki Masui (“Masui”) are Japanese nationals who were senior employees of a company incorporated in Japan (“the Japanese Company”). In the course of their employment, they were seconded to the Singaporean subsidiary of the Japanese Company (“the Singaporean Company”). 2 The Japanese Company supplies edible and industrial flour through the Singaporean Company. Chia Lee & Co (“Chia Lee”), a sole proprietorship owned by Koh Pee Chiang (“Koh”), was the sole distributor of edible flour for the Singaporean Company between 1978 and 2002. A company known as Sin Heng Chan was the Singaporean Company’s industrial flour distributor until 2002. In mid-2002, and despite his unfamiliarity with the industrial flour business, Koh reluctantly acceded to Ishibe’s request that he take over the industrial flour distributorship from Sin Heng Chan as he feared that Chia Lee’s edible flour business would be adversely affected otherwise.3 Koh, Ishibe and Masui entered into an arrangement to share the profits earned by Chia Lee from its industrial flour business (“the profit-sharing arrangement”). Ishibe and Masui received the lion’s share of the profits under this arrangement. When Chia Lee’s customer defaulted on payments totalling US$326,007, Masui transferred US$240,000 via Chia Lee to Koh on 15 June 2005. 4 The profit-sharing arrangement was eventually discovered. Ishibe and Masui each claimed trial to 28 charges under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the PCA for conspiring with each other to corruptly obtain gratification from Koh as inducements for furthering Chia Lee’s business interests with the Singaporean Company. The District Judge found that they had received payments from Koh, amounting to $2,051,402, in exchange for their continued support for and protection of Chia Lee’s edible flour business. He convicted Ishibe and Masui on all charges and sentenced them to 66 months’ imprisonment each. Pursuant to s 13 of the PCA, the District Judge also ordered that they each pay a penalty of $1,025,701 (being half of the total gratification sum) or serve an imprisonment term of six months in default of payment.5 On appeal, the High Court judge (“the Judge”) upheld Ishibe’s and Masui’s convictions but reduced their sentences to 43 months and three weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $200,944. Although Ishibe and Masui argued that certain sums that had been purportedly disgorged from them ought to be deducted from the penalties imposed under s 13 of the PCA, the Judge disagreed. He held that where the gratification was “a sum of money”, the court had to impose a penalty of a sum equal to the amount of the gratification. Nevertheless, as the Judge found that the total gratification sum was $2,009,433, he reduced the penalty payable by Ishibe and Masui to $1,004,716.50 each. Adding the fine and the penalty, the Judge imposed a recomputed sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment in default of payment of the aggregate sum of $1,205,660.50.6 In CA/CM 1/2021 (“CM 1”), Ishibe sought leave to refer the following three purported questions of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal (“the Court”):(a) Where an agent requests a third party to assist as an intermediary in a profit-making scheme conceived by the agent for the agent’s own benefit and the profits generated by the scheme are not causally connected to the acts done by the agent in relation to his principal’s affairs, do the profits constitute “gratification” for the purposes of s 6(a) of the PCA? (“the Gratification Question”)(b) For the purposes of s 6(a) of the PCA, does the “act” done by the agent “in relation to his principal’s affairs” need to either confer a dishonest benefit or advantage on the third party or be at the expense of the interests of the agent’s principal? (“the Act Question”)(c) In a Magistrate’s Appeal, does the High Court have a duty to address the grounds of appeal raised in the petition of appeal and/or the appellant’s written submissions and give independent reasons for rejecting or dismissing them? Ishibe’s counsel subsequently sought to amend this question.7 In CA/CM 2/2021 (“CM 2”), Masui sought leave to refer three purported questions of law of public interest to the Court.(a) The first two questions pertained to whether the District Judge and the Judge had respectively fulfilled their judicial duty to give reasoned decisions.(c) The third question was as follows: “Whether, in a case where the accused is the recipient, the giver must have a reasonable basis for believing that it was a quid pro quo for the recipient to confer a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation to his principal’s affairs, in order to make out an offence under section 6(a) of the [PCA].” (“the Reasonable Basis Question”)8 The Court referred to the third question in CM 1 (in both its original and amended forms) and the first two questions in CM 2 collectively as “the Reasons Questions”.9 The Prosecution also filed a criminal reference, CA/CRF 3/2020 (“CRF 3”). It submitted that there was a conflict of judicial authority between the Judge’s decision and another High Court decision on the proper construction of s 13 of the PCA. According to the Prosecution, where the gratification was a sum of money, the court had to impose a penalty of a sum equivalent to the gratification sum. The Prosecution also contended that the court could only take into account any repayment or disgorgement of the gratification sum if the gratification was a loan of money, but not if the gratification was a gift of money.The Court’s decision on CM 1 and CM 210 The Gratification Question was a question of fact (at [32]). It was also not a question of law of public interest as it could be resolved by applying established legal principles (at [36]).11 Although Ishibe’s counsel argued that the relevant gratification was not Koh’s payments to Masui and Ishibe but the services rendered by Koh to them, this distinction would not have affected the outcome of the case (at [33]–[34]). In any event, it was impermissible for Ishibe to seek leave to file a criminal reference to challenge the way in which the Prosecution had particularised the charges (at [35]).12 The Act Question could not be entertained as it challenged the Judge’s factual finding that the profit-sharing arrangement was objectively corrupt (at [40]). It was also a purely hypothetical question that could not have affected the outcome of the case (at [41]).13 The Reasonable Basis Question did not arise for determination by the High Court and was not a question of public interest (at [44] and [46]). The determination of that question would also not have affected the outcome of the case (at [45]). Masui’s real grievance lay with the Judge’s factual finding that Koh’s payments were objectively corrupt inducements for him and Ishibe to continue protecting Chia Lee’s edible flour distributorship (at [47]).14 Whether and the extent to which the High Court, in its appellate capacity, has a duty to give reasons is an inherently factual inquiry (at [49]). Judges are not obliged to respond to every argument point by point (at [49]). In dismissing an appeal, a judge is not required to provide independent reasons, to address the specific grounds raised in the petition of appeal, or to reprise the trial judge’s reasons (at [50]). 15 The Reasons Questions were questions of fact and, in any event, were not questions of public interest (at [49]–[51]). Moreover, the Reasons Questions raised in CM 2 did not arise for determination by the High Court, and their determination would have had no bearing on the outcome of the case (at [52]).16 The Court thus dismissed CM 1 and CM 2 (at [2] and [58]). As those applications were backdoor appeals that had been brought in abuse of process, Ishibe and Masui were each ordered to pay costs of $2,000 to the Prosecution (at [61]–[62]). 17 Although the Court ultimately declined to make a personal costs order against counsel for Ishibe and Masui, it cautioned that unjustified allegations against judges would usually result in personal costs orders against counsel (at [63]–[64]).The Court’s decision on CRF 318 Although the Court agreed to answer the question raised in CRF 3, it reframed the question as follows: “Where the gratification is a sum of money, must the court order the recipient to pay a penalty under s 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 231, 1993 Rev Ed) of a sum equivalent to the amount of money received by him, if (a) he has returned or repaid all or part of the sum of money; and/or (b) all or part of the sum of money has been disgorged from him, whether voluntarily or otherwise?” (“the Referred Question”) (at [71]).19 The Judge’s and the Prosecution’s interpretation of s 13(1) of the PCA would require the court to interpret the phrase “a sum of money” to mean a gift of money only, even though that phrase encompassed both gifts of money and loans of money (at [79]). It also ignored the fact that even if gratification in the form of a gift of money and gratification in the form of a loan of money were of the same amount, the value of the gratification might well be very different. The value of gratification in the form of a loan of money was not necessarily the amount of the loan principal and was instead likely to be the benefit of having had the use of that sum of money from the time of receipt to the time of repayment (at [80]).20 The ordinary meaning of s 13(1) of the PCA was as follows: as long as the gratification was a sum of money or of a value that could be assessed, the court had to order the recipient to pay a penalty of a sum equal to the amount of that gratification or a sum that was, in its opinion, the value of that gratification (at [83] and [87]). This meant that where the gratification was a sum of money, but all or part of it had been repaid or disgorged, the court ought to impose a penalty of a sum that reflected the value of the gratification retained by the recipient (at [87] and [95]).21 The phrase “if that gratification is a sum of money or if the value of that gratification can be assessed”, as used in s 13(1) of the PCA, was intended to ensure that the gratification was quantifiable for the purposes of imposing a penalty (at [83]). Although s 13(1) of the PCA distinguished between monetary and non-monetary gratification, that distinction merely made it clear that even if the gratification was non-monetary, a penalty could nonetheless be imposed by reference to the value of that gratification (at [84]). It would be unprincipled if the court could value non-monetary gratification, but not money gratification that had been repaid, returned or disgorged (at [85]–[86]).22 The legislative purpose of s 13(1) of the PCA was not to impose an additional layer of punishment, but to prevent corrupt recipients from retaining their ill-gotten gains (at [85], [91], [92], [107], [116] and [140]). 23 Among the interests of the State, the giver, the recipient and the principal, the principal’s interest in recovery assumed primacy (at [106], [109], [112] and [117]). Since the principal had the most compelling claim to the gratification sum, the law ought to incentivise repayment to him (at [109] and [122]). 24 The Prosecution’s interpretation of s 13(1) of the PCA would not only discourage a recipient who wished to purge his wrongdoing by voluntarily returning the gratification sum to the principal, but would also penalise such a recipient by rendering him liable to pay a penalty for the full amount of the gratification nonetheless (at [110]). Moreover, on the Prosecution’s construction, a recipient who voluntarily repaid or surrendered the gratification sum to the principal would, perversely, be worse off than one who did not do so (at [93], [96] and [112]).25 Where the authorities had disgorged the gratification sum in full, the court ought to: (a) order that the disgorged sum be forfeited to the State, without imposing a penalty; or (b) impose a penalty for the full gratification sum but order that the penalty be paid out of the disgorged moneys. The court ought to also impose a penalty equivalent to the value of the recipient’s ability to use the gratification sum from the time of receipt to the time of disgorgement, to account for the benefit that the recipient would have had (at [119]).26 Where the authorities had disgorged the gratification sum only in part, the court ought to: (a) impose a penalty in respect of the balance amount; or (b) impose a penalty in respect of the entire gratification sum but order that the disgorged moneys be applied towards part payment of the penalty. The court ought to additionally impose a penalty equivalent to the value of the recipient’s ability to use the disgorged sum from the time of receipt to the time of disgorgement (at [121]).27 Where the principal had recovered the gratification sum from the recipient, whether in whole or in part, the court ordinarily ought to deduct the repaid amount from the penalty imposed. However, even if the principal fully recovered the gratification sum from the recipient, the latter would still be liable to pay a penalty of an amount that represented the value of his ability to use the gratification sum from the time of receipt to the time of repayment (at [122]).28 The relevant cut-off point when examining if any part of the gratification sum had been repaid or disgorged was the time at which the penalty was first imposed, whether at trial or on appeal (at [127] and [132]). 29 Where the recipient returned the gratification sum to the principal in full before a penalty was imposed, the gratification would be disgorged on a 100% basis. Only where a penalty was imposed before the principal recovered the gratification sum would disgorgement be on a 200% basis (at [126] and [140]). The recipient thus ought to repay the principal promptly or assume the risk of double disgorgement (at [130]).30 Where the recipient alleged that the money gratification was a loan rather than a gift, the court ought to examine the surrounding facts carefully to determine if the money gratification was indeed a loan. If the facts disclosed a gift of money masquerading as a loan of money, or if the recipient failed to repay what had originally been intended to be a loan of money, the penalty amount would be equivalent to the entire sum of money received (at [133]).31 The court also ought to consider whether the repayment to the giver had indeed disgorged the benefit of the gratification received by the recipient, or whether it was merely a ruse to sustain the corrupt arrangement between the recipient and the giver (at [134]–[135]). Only in cases of the former should the repayments to the giver be taken into consideration for the purposes of s 13(1) of the PCA (at [132] and [135]). If the repayments to the giver were genuine, the court ought to impose a penalty in respect of: (a) the value of the recipient’s ability to use the gratification sum from the time of receipt to the time of disgorgement; and (b) any amount of the gratification that had yet to be repaid (at [135]).32 The Court therefore answered the Referred Question in the negative, although the quantification of the penalty imposed under s 13(1) of the PCA would depend on the precise circumstances of the repayment or disgorgement (at [139] and [148]).33 The Court’s purposive interpretation of s 13(1) of the PCA not only furthered the object of that provision, but also did justice to the four main interests engaged. It also vindicated the principal’s interest, which was of foremost significance (at [117], [130] and [140]).34 The sum of $200,000 paid by Ishibe and Masui to the Singaporean Company in full and final settlement of the judgment sum awarded by a Japanese civil court against them ought to be deducted from the penalties imposed (at [142]–[143]).35 Since Masui and Ishibe effectively retained the benefit of the sum of US$240,000 that Masui had paid to Koh in June 2005, that sum ought not to be deducted from the penalties imposed (at [144]). As for the sums recovered by the authorities from Masui’s frozen bank accounts, the Judge had ordered that they be applied towards payment of the penalties, and those sums ought not to be deducted (at [145]).36 The Court accordingly reduced the penalty imposed on Masui and Ishibe each to $904,716.50 (at [146] and [149]). Taking into account the reduced aggregate sum of $1,105,660.50 (comprising the fine of $200,944 and the reduced penalty of $904,716.50) payable by Masui and Ishibe each, the Court reduced the default sentence to 11 months’ imprisonment (at [147] and [149]).This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision. It is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the Court. All numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the Court’s grounds of decision.
