Singapore International Commercial Court Suit No 5 of 2016



____________________________________________________________________

Decision of Vivian Ramsey IJ


SICC sets out guidance on the principles for orders as to costs for matters
before the SICC


Background


1          This was the judgment dealing with the costs of the proceedings, which
concerned an agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) under which the Second
Defendant provided a non-recourse loan to the Plaintiff, with the Plaintiff
providing certain shares (“the Pledged Shares”) as collateral for the loan.
The Suit, which had originally been commenced in the High Court, was
transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) on 28
June 2016. The court handed down judgment dealing with the issues of
liability on 17 July 2017, but dealt with the issues of costs separately.


2          In the judgment on liability, the court found, in favour of the
Plaintiff, that the Second Defendant was not entitled to sell the Pledged
Shares and, by selling those shares, it repudiated the Loan Agreement. This
entitled the Plaintiff to accept that repudiation and terminate the Loan
Agreement. The Second Defendant thus held the proceeds of that sale, less
the loan amount on a constructive trust for the Plaintiff. However, the
court also found that: (a) the Plaintiff’s claim against the First
Defendant failed, (b) the Plaintiff’s claim that the sale of the Pledged
Shares had caused the substantial fall in the share price of those shares,
thereby causing the Plaintiff to suffer loss in the value of its further
shareholding in the shares (“the Portfolio Claim”), was not made out, and
(c) the Plaintiff’s claim in conversion failed.


3          During the hearing on costs on 28 September 2017, the Plaintiff sought
recovery of its costs and disbursements on the basis that it was the
successful party, claiming costs of S$56,000 (for interlocutory
applications) and S$450,000 (for the proceedings, excluding interlocutory
applications), and disbursements of S$5,681.82 (for interlocutory
applications) and S$28,600.26 plus HK$648,427.57 (for the proceedings,
excluding interlocutory applications). The Plaintiff also sought indemnity
costs from the date of service of an offer made to the Defendants on 9
November 2016 to settle the suit for HK$13,000,000 (“the Offer”), which the
Defendants had rejected. The Defendants claimed that they should only pay
the Plaintiff 40% of its costs as there should be reductions for the
Plaintiff failing to succeed on certain claims. They also submitted that
the costs guidelines in Appendix G to the Supreme Court Practice Directions
(“Appendix G”) should apply to guide the court in making the costs order,
and that indemnity costs should not be ordered because O 22A r 9 of the
Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) does not apply in
the SICC.


The decision


4          The court made the following orders for costs: (a) the Plaintiff is to
have its reasonable costs before the date of transfer, 28 June 2016, with
an allowance to be deducted in respect of the costs of its claim against
the First Defendant and the Portfolio Claim; (b) the Plaintiff is to have
its reasonable costs from 28 June 2016 to the date of the Offer, 9 November
2016, with an allowance to be deducted in respect of the costs of its claim
against the First Defendant and the Portfolio Claim; and (c) the Plaintiff
is to have its reasonable costs after 9 November 2016, without any
deduction in respect of the costs of its claim against the First Defendant
and the Portfolio Claim. Accordingly, the court found that the Plaintiff
was entitled to S$47,906.20 for its costs and disbursements for the
interlocutory applications, and S$384,000 for its costs for the proceedings
(excluding interlocutory applications) and S$28,600.26, plus HK$648,427.57
for its disbursements for the proceedings (excluding the interlocutory
applications). ([38], [43], [48], [52] and [53])


5          In arriving at those costs orders, the court held that O 110 r 46 of the
ROC applies to govern the costs of proceedings in the SICC, and this is
supplemented by para 152 of the SICC Practice Directions. Order 110 r 46
expressly precludes the application of the costs regime under O 59, and
obliges an unsuccessful party in the SICC to pay the reasonable costs of
the proceedings to the successful party unless the court orders otherwise.
This rule, together with para 152 of the SICC Practice Directions, gives
the court the discretion to take into account such circumstances of the
case that the court considers relevant in dealing with costs. (    [14], [15], [16] and [17])


6          The court also held that for cases which are filed in the High Court and
transferred to the SICC under O 110 r 12 of the ROC, although Appendix G
does not automatically apply to proceedings in the SICC, it is likely for
the SICC to take account of Appendix G in assessing what are reasonable
pre-transfer costs under O 110 r 46. As for post-transfer costs, even
absent an agreement by the parties or a court order that Appendix G should
continue to be relevant post-transfer, the SICC can take into account all
the circumstances of the case. There is nothing to preclude the SICC from
taking account of Appendix G even in assessing reasonable costs under O 110
r 46 in a case transferred from the High Court to the SICC, unless parties
have agreed to disregard Appendix G altogether. Hence, in this case, the
court held that pre-transfer costs should be assessed taking account of the
fact that the High Court costs regime under O 59 would have applied to
costs incurred pre-transfer, and that Appendix G is one of a number of
factors to be considered in assessing reasonable costs for costs incurred
post-transfer. ([21], [23], [24], [25] and [27])


7          As for the effect of the Offer, the court determined that O 22A rr 9 and
10 of the ROC, which are intended to operate in the context of the High
Court costs regime under O 59, do not apply to offers to settle in the SICC
because they are inconsistent with O 110 r 46. However, the other
provisions of O 22A, including O 22A r 12 which details the matters that
the court may take into account in exercising its discretion as to costs,
could continue to apply. Hence, the appropriate way in this case to take
the Offer into account was to allow the Plaintiff its reasonable costs from
9 November 2016, without making an allowance for the costs it incurred in
respect of the failed claim against the First Defendant or the Portfolio
Claim. ([30], [31] and [37])
