SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE8 October 2021Case summaryThe Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters [2021] SGCA 96Civil Appeals Nos 47 and 52 of 2020, and Summonses Nos 72, 97 and 98 of 2020------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Sundaresh Menon CJ):Outcome: The court allows CA/SUM 97/2020, CA/SUM 98/2020 and part of CA/CA 52/2020; dismisses CA/CA 47/2020; and makes no order on CA/SUM 72/2020.Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:•  A statement that has been identified as a false statement of fact (a “subject statement”) under Part 3 of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (Act 18 of 2019) (“the POFMA”) nonetheless continues to enjoy protection under Art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”), which sets out the right to freedom of speech, at least until it has been judicially determined to be indeed a false statement of fact. The constitutionality of a Correction Direction or a Stop Communication Direction (a “Part 3 Direction”) issued under Part 3 of the POFMA therefore falls to be scrutinised under Art 14 of the Constitution: at [61].•  The POFMA is not unconstitutional, whether in whole or in part: at [105] and [113].•  In determining whether a Part 3 Direction may be set aside under s 17(5)(a) and/or s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA, the court should apply a five-step analytical framework which involves ascertaining: (a) first, the meaning that is intended to be placed on the subject statement by the Minister on whose authority the Direction is issued (“the Minister”); (b) second, whether the subject statement so understood is made or contained in the material in respect of which the Direction is issued; (c) third, whether the subject statement is a “statement of fact”; (d) fourth, whether the subject statement is “false”; and (e) fifth, whether the subject statement “has been or is being communicated in Singapore”: at [117] and [163].•  The burden of proof in proceedings to set aside a Part 3 Direction under s 17 of the POFMA lies from the outset on the recipient of the Direction. The recipient of the Direction must show a prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that one or more of the grounds for setting aside the Direction under s 17(5) is satisfied. What is required in this regard is that the recipient of the Direction put forward some material which might, on further consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of setting aside the Direction. If this is not established, the s 17 application will fail at the threshold. Conversely, if this threshold is crossed, the evidential burden will then shift to the Minister to show that none of the grounds for setting aside under s 17(5) are made out: at [180] and [183]–[184].Background to the appeals1 CA/CA 47/2020 (“CA 47”) and CA/CA 52/2020 (“CA 52”) were appeals by, respectively, The Online Citizen Pte Ltd (“TOC”) and the Singapore Democratic Party (“SDP”) against Correction Directions (“CDs”) issued to them under s 11 of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (Act 18 of 2019) (“the POFMA”), requiring them to insert correction notices in certain of their online publications.2 In SDP’s case, three CDs (collectively, “the SDP CDs”) were issued. The first CD (“SDP CD-1”) pertained to an online article published in June 2019 (“the SDP Article”), in which SDP criticised the Government’s prevailing immigration policy for having “allow[ed] in too many foreign workers into Singapore to displace local PMETs [meaning professionals, managers, executives and technicians]”, and outlined various proposals for reform. This article contained a sentence stating: “The SDP’s proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched” (“the Relevant Sentence”). The second CD (“SDP CD-2”) pertained to a Facebook post published in November 2019 (“the November Facebook post”) which advocated greater protection for “Singaporeans” who were being or had been “displaced from their PMET jobs by foreign employees”, and which contained a hyperlink to the SDP Article. The third CD (“SDP CD-3”) pertained to a Facebook post published in December 2019 (“the December Facebook post”) which was substantially similar to the November Facebook post, and which likewise contained a hyperlink to the SDP Article. The December Facebook post also set out, in addition, a graphical illustration depicting decreasing “[l]ocal PMET employment” and increasing “[f]oreign PMET employment”.3 Two false statements of fact (termed “subject statements” for the purposes of Part 3 of the POFMA) were identified in the SDP CDs. The first subject statement was that “Local PMET retrenchment has been increasing”. It was said to have arisen from the Relevant Sentence in the SDP Article, and was the basis upon which SDP CD-1, SDP CD-2 and the second half of SDP CD-3 (which was that part of SDP CD-3 that was directed at the hyperlink to the SDP Article in the December Facebook post) were issued. The second subject statement was that “Local PMET employment has gone down”. It was said to have arisen from the graphical illustration in the December Facebook post, and was the basis upon which the first half of SDP CD-3 was issued.4 In TOC’s case, the CD that was issued (“the TOC CD”) pertained to an online article published by TOC in January 2020 (“the TOC Article”), in which it substantially reproduced allegations made by a Malaysian non-governmental organisation known as Lawyers for Liberty (“LFL”) as to the “brutal & unlawful hanging methods” allegedly employed at Changi Prison. Those allegations, as reproduced in the TOC Article, constituted the subject statement identified in the TOC CD.5 SDP’s and TOC’s respective applications under s 19 of the POFMA to the Minister for Manpower (in SDP’s case) and the Minister for Home Affairs (in TOC’s case) to cancel the CDs issued against them were unsuccessful. SDP and TOC then each commenced proceedings in the High Court under s 17 of the POFMA to set aside these CDs. Their respective applications were both dismissed by the High Court, whereupon they filed the present appeals. Further to its appeal, SDP sought leave in CA/SUM 97/2020 (“SUM 97”) to raise new grounds of appeal, specifically, that certain provisions of the POFMA, and, consequently, the SDP CDs, were unconstitutional for inconsistency with the right to freedom of speech conferred by Art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”). On its part, TOC sought leave in CA/SUM 72/2020 (“SUM 72”) to adduce further evidence that would purportedly demonstrate the truth of the allegations by LFL (as reproduced in the TOC Article) which constituted the subject statement identified in the TOC CD, and also sought leave in CA/SUM 98/2020 (“SUM 98”) to have some of SDP’s constitutional arguments considered in respect of its appeal.The Court of Appeal’s decisionSDP’s and TOC’s further applications on appeal6 The Court of Appeal (“the CA”) allowed SUM 97 and SUM 98, but made no order on SUM 72 as, by the time of the hearing of the appeals, the focus of TOC’s arguments was no longer on proving the truth of the aforesaid allegations by LFL which constituted the subject statement identified in the TOC CD: at [36]–[38].The constitutionality of Part 3 of the POFMA7 Although the right to freedom of speech conferred by Art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution arguably might not apply to speech which had been determined by a court to be false, a statement that had been identified as a false statement of fact (that is to say, as a subject statement) under Part 3 of the POFMA nonetheless continued to enjoy protection under Art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, at least until it had been judicially determined to be indeed a false statement of fact. It followed that the issuance of a CD or a Stop Communication Direction (a “Part 3 Direction”) under Part 3 of the POFMA, which had to be complied with once it was issued, was an exercise of state power against speech that remained constitutionally protected speech pending a judicial determination as to whether or not it constituted a false statement of fact. The constitutionality of a Part 3 Direction therefore fell to be scrutinised under Art 14 of the Constitution: at [58] and [61].8 The issuance of a CD under Part 3 of the POFMA did not, in and of itself, restrict the positive right to freedom of speech of the communicator of the subject statement identified in the CD. This was because the communicator of the subject statement could continue to publish the material it had communicated, including the alleged falsehood, subject only to the requirement under s 11(1) of the POFMA that it put up a correction notice highlighting the alleged falsehood. TOC’s argument based on the doctrine of compelled speech drawn from the constitutional law of the United States – namely, that the issuance of a CD curtailed the negative right to freedom of speech of the communicator of the subject statement, in terms of its right not to be compelled to express views or opinions that it did not hold – was not made out on the facts of CA 47. This was because TOC was not prevented from communicating, so long as it did so in a factually accurate manner, that it was challenging the TOC CD, and that whether there were any grounds for setting it aside remained subject to judicial determination. The CA thus held that the issuance of the TOC CD did not constitute compelled speech. The CA did not, however, come to a conclusive view as to whether the doctrine of compelled speech formed part of Singapore’s constitutional law landscape: at [67]–[69] and [77]–[79].9 For completeness, the CA observed that even if the issuance of a CD under Part 3 of the POFMA did restrict the right to freedom of speech of the communicator of the subject statement identified in the CD, any such restriction was justifiable under Art 14(2)(a) of the Constitution, which set out the permitted grounds for derogating from this right. It was clear beyond doubt, from the legislative material pertaining to the enactment of the POFMA, that Parliament had considered this Act to be “necessary or expedient” in the interests of national security and public order, both of which were among the Art 14(2)(a) grounds for derogation. Furthermore, the “public interest” identified in s 4 of the POFMA, which underlay the issuance of Part 3 Directions, fell within the ambit of “public order” for the purposes of Art 14(2)(a) of the Constitution. Specifically, there was a nexus between the public interest identified in the two limbs of s 4 of the POFMA that were in issue in these appeals – namely, ss 4(d) and 4(f), which pertained to, respectively, the prevention of improper influence over the electoral process, and the prevention of a diminution of public confidence in the Government and other key public institutions – and public order, in that it was entirely conceivable that the proliferation of online falsehoods, which was what the POFMA had been enacted to address, could threaten the preservation of public order by (among other things) undermining trust in the Government and other key public institutions and/or interfering with a free and fair electoral process. This could shake the foundations of a democratic society to its very core, and carried the potential for far greater harm: at [89]–[93] and [99]–[102].10 The CA also considered two other arguments that were raised by TOC in relation to the constitutionality of Part 3 of the POFMA. The first was that there was a fundamental constitutional right to make statements that were true when read in context; therefore, s 2(2)(b) of the POFMA should be struck down in so far as it provided that a statement could be treated as false, and, thus, made the subject of a Part 3 Direction, even when it was read out of context. The CA rejected this argument as statements that were rendered false when they were reasonably understood in a particular way, whether read in or out of context, could conceivably cause the very harm that the POFMA had been enacted to address. The second argument was that if the constitutionality of the POFMA were affirmed, a requirement of proportionality ought to be read into s 4, in that in assessing whether it was in the “public interest” to issue a Part 3 Direction, consideration had to be given to whether utilising the executive powers under Part 3 of the POFMA was “the least restrictive means available … in the circumstances” of taking action against a statement that was deemed to be a false statement of fact. The CA rejected this argument as well, noting that it was based on a misunderstanding of comments made during the parliamentary debates in the lead-up to the enactment of the POFMA. Moreover, s 4 of the POFMA already incorporated an element of proportionality, and there was no basis to read into it a further and different conception of proportionality: at [107]–[109] and [110]–[112].11 The CA thus held that the POFMA was not unconstitutional, whether in whole or in part: at [105] and [113].The applicable approach in determining whether a Part 3 Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(a) and/or s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA12 The CA held that in determining whether a Part 3 Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(a) and/or s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA, the court should apply a five-step analytical framework as follows: at [117] and [163].13 First, the court had to determine the meaning that was intended to be placed on the subject statement by the Minister on whose authority the Part 3 Direction in question was issued (“the Minister”). This was essential because that meaning (“the Minister’s intended meaning”) was the meaning that the Minister intended to act against in framing the subject statement as he did, and formed the basis for his decision to issue the Direction. Where the Minister considered that the material in respect of which a Part 3 Direction was issued (“the subject material”) bore more than one possible meaning that ought to be acted against, it was incumbent on him to set out the meanings that he intended to act against by identifying them as subject statements in the Direction. It was not open to the court to uphold the Direction on the basis of a possible meaning of the subject material that had not been identified as a subject statement, and that therefore had not been shown to be a meaning that the Minister intended to act against. What was required for the purposes of ascertaining the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of a subject statement was an objective construction of the subject statement in the light of the Part 3 Direction in question as a whole. It was the subject statement as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning which was the subject statement that the court was concerned with under the second to fifth steps of the analytical framework: at [117(a)], [119], [125], [133] and [163(a)].14 Second, the court had to determine whether the subject material made or contained the subject statement (or statements) identified by the Minister. This should be done by: (a) interpreting the subject material objectively in its proper context, and as a matter of impression rather than of fine-grained or unduly technical analysis; and (b) asking whether, on that approach to the subject material, there would be at least an appreciable segment or a particular class of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore who would construe it as making or containing the subject statement, or regard the subject statement as a reasonable interpretation of the subject material. The “single meaning rule” in defamation law, which required the court to ascertain “the single and the right meaning” of the words in question, was inapplicable to this interpretive exercise. The subjective intention of the maker of the statement (or other material) that was said to be or to give rise to the subject statement was also irrelevant. However, the court should be alive to the likelihood that the particular part of the subject material that was said to be or to give rise to the subject statement might be taken out of context from the subject material as a whole due to factors such as “clickbait”, deceptive headlines, or forms of emphasis placed on that part of the subject material. If the court found that the subject material did not in fact make or contain the subject statement identified by the Minister, the Part 3 Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(a) of the POFMA: at [117(b)], [135]–[136], [150]–[152], [154], [156]–[157] and [163(b)].15 Third, the court had to determine whether the subject statement identified by the Minister was a “statement of fact” as defined in s 2(2)(a) of the POFMA; and, fourth, the court had to determine whether the subject statement was “false” in the sense explained in s 2(2)(b) of the POFMA. An objective approach applied to both steps. If the subject statement was not a “statement of fact” and/or was not “false”, the Part 3 Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA: at [117(c)], [117(d)], [158]–[159], [163(c)] and [163(d)].16 Fifth, the court had to determine whether the subject statement identified by the Minister “ha[d] been or [was] being communicated in Singapore”, in the sense that it had been or was being “made available to one or more end-users in Singapore on or through the internet” as stated in s 3(1) of the POFMA. The element of communication would not be established if the subject material that was said to make or contain the subject statement: (a) did not in fact do so; or (b) was not published on or through the internet; or (c) was not accessible by any end-user in Singapore. In that event, the Part 3 Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(a) of the POFMA: at [117(e)], [161]–[162] and [163(e)].The burden and standard of proof in applications to set aside Part 3 Directions under s 17 of the POFMA17 The burden of proof in proceedings to set aside a Part 3 Direction under s 17 of the POFMA lay from the outset on the recipient of the Direction. The recipient of the Direction had to show a prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that one or more of the grounds for setting aside the Direction under s 17(5) was satisfied. What was required in this regard was that the recipient of the Direction put forward some material which might, on further consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of setting aside the Direction. If the recipient of the Direction could not establish this, its application would fail at the threshold. Conversely, if this threshold was crossed, the evidential burden would then shift to the Minister to show that none of the grounds for setting aside under s 17(5) were made out. The final determination would be made by the court based on the totality of the evidence adduced by the parties, applying the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities: at [180] and [183]–[184].CA 52: SDP’s appeal18 On the face of the first subject statement, which was the basis upon which SDP CD-1, SDP CD-2 and the second half of SDP CD-3 (collectively, “the SDP CDs pertaining to the SDP Article”) were issued, the Minister’s intended meaning was that this subject statement was a statement that local PMET retrenchment had been increasing in absolute numerical terms. This was also advanced by the Attorney-General (“the AG”) as the primary interpretation of the Relevant Sentence, which was the specific sentence in the SDP Article that was said to give rise to the first subject statement. The alternative interpretation canvassed by the AG – namely, that the Relevant Sentence referred to a rising proportion of retrenched local PMETs compared to all local PMET employees – was not identified as an alternative subject statement in the SDP CDs pertaining to the SDP Article, and therefore could not constitute a basis for upholding these CDs. For the same reason, even though the Minister, in explaining the basis for her determination that the first subject statement was a false statement of fact, provided data from the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) which showed a decline in local PMET retrenchment for the period from 2015 to 2018 both in absolute numerical terms and also as a proportion of total local PMET employment, this did not suffice to alter her intended meaning in respect of the first subject statement: at [197]–[207].19 Although the Relevant Sentence referred to “a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”, it did not mention what this rise was a proportion of. In the absence of a comparator, the reference to a “proportion” did not make sense. As a result, this would, on the balance of probabilities, have led to at least an appreciable segment or a particular class of the SDP Article’s potential readership or audience in Singapore having the impression that the Relevant Sentence, when viewed in the light of the article as a whole, was in fact intended to refer instead to a rising number of “Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”, which corresponded to the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the first subject statement. Therefore, the SDP Article did make or contain the first subject statement as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning, and, by extension, the November Facebook post and the December Facebook post likewise made or contained this subject statement (so understood) due to their both containing a hyperlink to the SDP Article: at [211].20 The first subject statement, as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning, was a “statement of fact” as defined in s 2(2)(a) of the POFMA, as it was, on its face, a simple, straightforward assertion as to the fact of local PMET retrenchment increasing in absolute numerical terms. It was also false, as could be seen from the MOM data provided by the Minister, which showed a decline, rather than an increase, in local PMET retrenchment for the period from 2015 to 2018. In addition, the element of communication of the first subject statement in Singapore was satisfied as the SDP Article, the November Facebook post and the December Facebook post were all “made available to one or more end-users in Singapore on or through the internet” for the purposes of s 3(1) of the POFMA. There were therefore no grounds for setting aside the SDP CDs pertaining to the SDP Article under s 17(5) of the POFMA: at [213]–[216].21 In relation to the second subject statement, which was said to have arisen from the graphical illustration in the December Facebook post depicting decreasing “[l]ocal PMET employment” and increasing “[f]oreign PMET employment”, the definition of a “local” employee for the purposes of the MOM statistics which underlay the Minister’s determination that this subject statement was a false statement of fact made it clear that the Minister’s intended meaning was that this subject statement was a statement that the employment of PMETs who were either Singapore citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents (“SPRs”) had decreased. However, on an objective reading of the December Facebook post as a whole, there would not, on the balance of probabilities, have been any appreciable segment or any particular class of the potential readership or audience of the post in Singapore who, taking the post on its own, would have construed the word “[l]ocal” in the graphical illustration therein as meaning anything other than Singapore citizens, excluding SPRs. This was because of the words used in the post, as well as its overall thrust, which was clearly directed at protecting “Singaporeans … who had been displaced from their PMET jobs by foreign employees”, with no mention made of SPRs who might have been similarly displaced. This conclusion remained unchanged even if the post was read together with the SDP Article, which both the AG and SDP appeared to have regarded as pertaining to PMETs who were Singapore citizens as well as PMETs who were SPRs. This was similarly because of the words used in, and the overall thrust of, the SDP Article. It therefore had not been shown that there would have been any appreciable segment or any particular class of the potential readership or audience of the December Facebook post in Singapore who would have understood the word “[l]ocal” in the graphical illustration therein to bear the meaning intended by the Minister. It followed that the December Facebook post did not make or contain the second subject statement as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning. Accordingly, the CA set aside the first half of SDP CD-3 under s 17(5)(a) of the POFMA, and allowed SDP’s appeal to this extent: at [219]–[220] and [228]–[234].CA 47: TOC’s appeal22 In respect of the TOC CD, the CA highlighted the fact that the subject statement identified in this CD consisted of the allegations made by LFL which were reproduced in the TOC Article. For this reason, there was no doubt that the TOC Article contained the subject statement. There was also no issue as to the interpretation of the TOC Article, the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement and the element of communication of the subject statement in Singapore. TOC’s appeal turned instead on whether the subject statement was a “statement of fact”, and if so, whether it was “false”: at [238].23 The fact that the subject statement consisted of the allegations made by LFL that were reproduced in the TOC Article in the form of a neutral report did not take those allegations beyond the reach of the POFMA as this Act applied to falsehoods which were spread online under the guise of news reports. Those allegations constituted a “statement of fact” within the meaning of s 2(2)(a) of the POFMA because the ordinary reasonable reader of the TOC Article would clearly have considered them to be a “representation of fact”, given that they were not mere vague assertions in the nature of conjecture, but instead recounted in detail what was asserted to be a “brutal & unlawful” process of execution by hanging at Changi Prison. Those allegations were also false as they were baseless, and no evidence was even proffered by TOC to attempt to convince the CA otherwise. Since the subject statement was a false statement of fact and had been “communicated in Singapore”, there was no basis to set aside the TOC CD under either s 17(5)(a) or s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA. The CA thus dismissed TOC’s appeal: at [242]–[244]. This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment. It is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the Court. All numbers in bold font and square brackets refer to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the Court’s judgment.
