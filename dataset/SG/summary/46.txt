The Court of Appeal then clarified the orders to be made in respect of the Appeals in How Weng Fan and others v Sengkang Town Council and other appeals [2023] 2 SLR 235 (the “Supplementary Judgment”) in light of what appeared to be inadequacies in AHTC’s pleadings on a number of issues.2 In the Judgment and Supplementary Judgment, the Court of Appeal reversed several of the trial Judge’s factual findings and legal conclusions. Among other things, the Court of Appeal held that the Town Councillors and Employees did not owe fiduciary or equitable duties to AHTC or to STC. The Court of Appeal also held that they had acted in good faith in the award of various contracts on behalf of AHTC. However, the Court of Appeal held that the Town Councillors and Employees were grossly negligent in implementing AHTC’s and STC’s payments process (the “System”), which led to the persistence of what were referred to by parties as “control failures” in the System. Specifically, this arose from the involvement of conflicted persons in processing payments to FM Solutions & Services Pte Ltd (“FMSS”) and FM Solutions & Integrated Services (“FMSI”) and the absence of safeguards, which together created a risk of overpayments being made. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal held that Ms Lim was liable in negligence for AHTC’s award of a contract to Red-Power Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd (“Red-Power”). Accordingly, the Court of Appeal made the following orders: a) CA/CA 196/2019 (“CA 196”) was allowed in part, in that the Employees succeeded in reversing some of the heads on which they had been found liable by the Judge but were held liable to STC in negligence for permitting the control failures in the System to exist.b) CA/CA 197/2019 (“CA 197”) was allowed in part in that the Employees succeeded in reversing some of the heads on which they had been found liable by the Judge but were held liable to AHTC in negligence for permitting the control failures in the System to exist.c) CA/CA 198/2019 (“CA 198”) was in part in that the Town Councillors succeeded in reversing some of the heads on which they had been found liable by the Judge but were held liable to STC in negligence for permitting the control failures in the System to exist and Ms Lim was held liable to STC for causing AHTC to award a contract to Red-Power.d) CA/CA 199/2019 (“CA 199”) was allowed in part in that the Town Councillors succeeded in reversing some of the heads on which they had been found liable by the Judge but Mr Low and Ms Lim were held liable to AHTC in negligence for permitting the control failures in the System to exist.e) CA/CA 200/2019 was dismissed, because neither the Town Councillors nor the Employees owed any fiduciary duties to AHTC, and the issue of substitutive compensation therefore fell away.3 Pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s directions, the parties to the Appeals tendered their written submissions on costs.The Court of Appeal’s decisionThe Town Councillors, Employees and FMSS should be entitled to costs for the Appeals4 Costs are discretionary but this discretion necessarily has to be exercised in accordance with established principles. The “indemnity principle” underpinning the incidence of costs in civil litigation means that costs ordinarily follow the event. While it is often not controversial who the successful party is in a given litigation, the position becomes less clear where neither party can be said to have achieved a complete victory. The court will have to have regard to the outcome of the litigation as a whole and how the outcome reflects the respective and relative success of each party in the context of the dispute as a whole: at [30] and [31].5 Having regard to the overall outcome of the Appeals and the issues that were found in favour of the Town Councillors, Employees and FMSS, the Court of Appeal held that the Town Councillors, the Employees and FMSS had succeeded substantially in the Appeals and should, as a matter of course, be entitled to costs: at [32] to [34].A Certificate of Three Counsel should be awarded to the Councillors for CA 198 and CA 1996 An award of Certificate of Three Counsel should only be granted exceptionally in cases that involve a high degree of complexity of facts and/or law, or where there are many issues of both facts and law, and the trial is lengthy: at [37].7 The Court of Appeal considered that this was an exceptional case that warranted the award of a Certificate of Three Counsel to the Town Councillors for CA 198 and CA 199. This is because they involved complex issues of both law and fact and voluminous materials. In addition, the stakes in the appeals were very high for all parties involved and the claims against the Town Councillors and Employees were serious ones, involving allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties owing to the wrongful award of contracts, as well as the lack of oversight of public funds: The use of more than two counsel was therefore reasonably necessary for the adequate presentation and preparation for the appeals: at [40] to [44].8 However, a Certificate of Three Counsel was not warranted for CA 200, which was a relatively confined appeal and turned largely on a question of law, that in turn depended upon certain anterior questions being answered. Such questions were already the subject of CA 196, CA 197, CA 198 and CA 199. In addition, CA 200 was withdrawn in large part before the hearing of the Appeals: at [45].Separate costs orders ought to be made against STC in CA 196, CA 198 and CA 20209  Whether a single costs order or separate costs order should be made when several parties are separately represented requires the court to consider whether it is reasonable for the parties to engage separate counsel. This may include considering the following factors: (a) the degree of the community of interests among the parties; (b) the size of the sum or importance of the interest that is the subject matter of the dispute; and (c) the degree of overlap in the pre-hearing preparations and conduct of proceedings: at [47] to [49].10 It was appropriate for separate costs orders to be made against STC. The Court of Appeal rejected STC’s submission that a single costs order should be made against it in CA 196, CA 198 and CA 200. It was reasonable for the Town Councillors, Employees and FMSS to have engaged separate counsel. While there was a degree of shared interests as between the Town Councillors and the Employees and their interests were aligned in so far as they relied on the same broad arguments, there were some nuances and differences as between their positions. Moreover, the Town Councillors and Employees stood in distinct positions and acted in rather distinct capacities in respect of AHTC’s affairs. The nature of the claims against the Town Councillors, Employees and FMSS were also somewhat distinct: Any degree of overlap in the pre-hearing preparations and conduct of proceedings could not be taken too far, given the differences in the nature of the claims brought and the nature of the defences ran by the Town Councillors, Employees and FMSS: at [51] to [55]Conclusion11 In arriving at the quantum of costs payable for the Appeals, the Court of Appeal took into account the following: (a) there should be a degree of uplift for costs payable to the Town Councillors on account of the grant of the Certificate of Three Counsel; (b) there should be some discount in the costs payable to the Employees and FMSS for CA 196 and CA 197 given the overlap in work and the same should apply to the costs payable to the Town Councillors for CA 198 and CA 199; and (c) there should be some further discount in the costs payable by AHTC and STC as the Town Councillors and the Employees ultimately did not succeed on some issues in the Appeals:  at [57]. 12 For the above reasons, the Court of Appeal made the following costs orders in respect of the Appeals:a) For CA 196: STC to pay to the Employees and FMSS costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $51,637.50 and disbursements of $4,444.27, with the usual consequential orders to apply.b) For CA 197: AHTC to pay to the Employees and FMSS costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $63,112.50 and disbursements of $5,431.88, with the usual consequential orders to apply.c) For CA 198: STC to pay to the Town Councillors costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $78,532.03 and disbursements of $9,583.48, with the usual consequential orders to apply.d) For CA 199: AHTC to pay to the Town Councillors costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $95,983.59 and disbursements of $11,713.14, with the usual consequential orders to apply.e) For CA 200: STC to pay to Ms Lim and Mr Low costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $31,350 and disbursements of $3,539.04, and STC to pay to the Employees costs of and incidental to the appeal fixed at $31,350 and disbursements of $2,105.20. The security furnished by STC for CA 200 was to be equally divided amongst Ms Lim and Mr Low on the one hand and the Employees on the other hand.This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
