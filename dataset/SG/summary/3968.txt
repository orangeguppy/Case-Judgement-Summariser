Civil Appeal No 233 of 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision
of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong):
CoA allows luxury yacht dealer to retain
pre-contract deposit paid by prospective buyer to reserve two specific yachts
for his choice for a limited period notwithstanding that he decided not to
proceed with a purchase. 
Background to the appeal
1    In
early 2013, the respondent (deceased) (“Jiaravanon”) was in negotiations with
the appellant, a luxury yacht dealer, to purchase yachts from an Italian yacht
maker, Azimut Benetti SpA (“Azimut”). On 26 April 2013, Jiaravanon signed
an invoice agreeing to pay a deposit of €1m (“the Deposit”) to secure two
specific 100-ft yachts, identifiable by their hull numbers, until 15 May
2013, at which time the deposit was to be transferred to either yacht to become
the initial down payment. These two yachts were the 100 Leonardo hull
number 15 (“100L #15”) and the 100 Grande hull number 12
(“100G #12”). Jiaravanon paid the Deposit to the appellant on 29 April
2013, but it transpired that Azimut had just sold the 100G #12 to another
buyer. The appellant informed Jiaravanon that hull number 15 for the same
100 Grande model (“100G #15”) was the next available yacht.
Jiaravanon continued to discuss with the appellant’s representatives whether to
go ahead with a purchase. 
 
2    On
8 May 2013, Jiaravanon met the appellant’s and Azimut’s representatives in
Hong Kong and viewed a 100 Leonardo yacht. The appellant alleged that
Jiaravanon had agreed at this meeting to use the Deposit he had paid to the
appellant to secure the 100L #15 and 100G #15 until 31 May 2013
in order to enable him to choose between them, at which point the Deposit would
be applied to the purchase price of his chosen yacht. Jiaravanon denied that
such an agreement had been reached. On 9 May 2013, the appellant remitted
the Deposit to Azimut. 
 
3         As
events panned out, Jiaravanon eventually refused to purchase an Azimut yacht in
the 100-ft series. On 31 July 2013, a compromise was reached whereby half
the Deposit was to be applied to the purchase price of another Azimut yacht
that Jiaravanon had already purchased (“the Azimut 64”) (“compromise
agreement”). The remaining €500,000 (“the Remainder”) was the subject of
dispute in this appeal. 
 
4             
The
High Court judge (“the Judge”) held that the basis for the payment of the
Deposit, which was to secure the 100L #15 and the 100G #12 until 15 May
2013, failed when Azimut sold the 100G #12 to another buyer. No agreement
was reached on 8 May 2013 to use the Deposit as a non-refundable deposit
to secure the 100L #15 and 100G #15 for Jiaravanon’s choice by 31 May
2013. It was also not agreed on 31 July 2013 that the Remainder would be
utilised to purchase another yacht. Therefore, the Judge granted Jiaravanon
restitution of the Remainder. 
 
5             
The
appellant appealed against the Judge’s finding that Jiaravanon did not agree on
8 May 2013 to pay the Deposit to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit to
reserve the 100L #15 and 100G #15. Since the 100L #15 and
100G #15 were in fact reserved for Jiaravanon for the stipulated period,
the appellant argued that Jiaravanon was not entitled to restitution of the Remainder.
Decision on appeal
6             
Pre-contract
deposits are governed by general principles of restitution for failure of
consideration or basis. The inquiry into failure of consideration or basis has
two parts: first, what was the basis for the transfer in respect of which
restitution is sought; and second, did that basis fail? Since the appellant did
not contest that the initial basis for the payment of the Deposit had failed
when the 100G #12 was sold and that Jiaravanon was entitled to restitution
as of 30 April 2013, the burden fell on the appellant to establish that on
8 May 2013, the parties had agreed on a fresh basis for the Deposit and
this fresh basis did not fail. The question of whether the Deposit was
refundable was to be viewed with reference to the evidence of the basis for the
payment: at [47]–[48] and [60].
 
7             
The
Court of Appeal held that there was sufficiently cogent evidence in the
appellant’s favour that Jiaravanon had agreed on 8 May 2013 that the
Deposit would be applied to hold the 100L #15 and 100G #15 until at
least 31 May 2013 so that Jiaravanon could choose between them. The
Court’s reasons, in brief, were as follows:
 
a.    While it was a significant weakness in
the appellant’s case that there was no documentation of the fresh terms for the
appellant’s receipt of the Deposit, this was not insurmountable if the factual
matrix clearly pointed towards the existence of the alleged agreement: at [66]. 
 
b.    The testimony of the appellant’s
Azimut-brand representative, who met Jiaravanon on 8 May 2013, was
consistent with the surrounding evidence, including the relevant documentary
evidence and the parties’ contemporaneous conduct: at [65]. 
 
c.     Viewed in its proper context, the
appellant’s decision to remit the Deposit on 9 May 2013 to Azimut must
have followed from Jiaravanon’s agreement on 8 May 2013 to apply the
Deposit to reserve the 100L #15 and 100G #15. This was supported by
the text of the remittance record; the similarity in the structure of the
alleged holding deposit agreement and that of the earlier abortive holding agreement;
and the evidence of the appellant’s reliance on Jiaravanon’s authorisation to
remit the Deposit to Azimut: at [67]–[72].
 
d.    The manner in which the parties
conducted themselves was consistent with the alleged agreement. First, Jiaravanon
and the appellant knew that Azimut was holding the 100L #15 and 100G #15
off the market for Jiaravanon until 31 May 2013, and that Azimut would
only do so if a holding deposit had been paid to it. Second, the fact that the compromise
agreement reached on 31 July 2013 was understood as a “concession”, as
well as Jiaravanon’s willingness to pay the remainder of the purchase price of
the Azimut 64 under that existing contract without accounting for the
Remainder, suggested that the Deposit ought to have been forfeited when
Jiaravanon decided not to purchase either of the 100-ft yachts. Third,
Jiaravanon failed to challenge the appellant’s assertions of the alleged
holding deposit agreement of 8 May 2013, though less weight was placed on
this evidence because the relevant correspondence could have been crafted to
buttress either party’s position as the dispute over the Remainder had
crystallised by that time: at [73]–[79].
 
8                Since
the parties agreed on 8 May 2013 that the appellant would retain and apply
the Deposit for the purpose of securing the 100L #15 and 100G #15
until 31 May 2013 for Jiaravanon to choose between them, the basis of the Deposit
did not fail because both yachts were kept off the market for Jiaravanon until
at least 31 May 2013. Jiaravanon’s decision not to purchase either yacht
did not cause a total failure of basis because the payment was not made on the
basis that a contract of purchase would be executed. Accordingly, the appellant
was not liable to return the Remainder to Jiaravanon: at [81] and [83].
