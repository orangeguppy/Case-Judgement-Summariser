SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE23 December 2022Case summaryDiamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd v Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd and another appeal [2022] SGHC(A) 44Civil Appeal Nos 125 and 129 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court (delivered by Justice Quentin Loh):Outcome: Appellate Division allows cross-appeals by main contractor and subcontractor in part concerning construction works for the Singapore Changi Airport. Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  When a contract is terminated, in the absence of special provision, no claim to liquidated damages can be brought in respect of the period after termination. However, general damages are claimable.•  A contractor must fulfil the condition precedent for an extension of time to be availed of such an extension of time.•  The adjudicator has no power to order legal costs in relation to the adjudication. However, the legal costs of an adjudication may be included in a claim in a proceeding before a court or tribunal or in any other dispute resolution proceeding pursuant to s 30(4) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed).•  In determining whether such legal costs may be awarded, the court or arbitral tribunal hearing the final dispute will exercise its discretion in the interests of justice between the parties.o The extent to which the party seeking to claim legal costs incurred for the adjudication had ultimately succeeded in respect of the claims in the adjudication and before the court or arbitral tribunal will be of relevance though it may not be determinative.o Whether costs should follow the event or the ultimate outcome or whether it should be considered issue by issue or claim by claim in considering the number and quantum of the claims which the claiming party had succeeded in to determine the extent to which the claiming party had succeeded in the adjudication is best left to the judge or arbitral tribunal seised of the disputes between the parties.o There may be circumstances where it may be inappropriate to allow a claim for legal costs even if all or a substantial amount of the claims comprised in the adjudication determination are subsequently set aside.1 The present dispute concerns two cross-appeals in AD/CA 125/2021 (“CA 125”) and AD/CA 129/2021 (“CA 129”) arising out of the decision of the High Court judge (the “Judge”) in Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd v Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 277 (the “Judgment”).Background to the cross-appeals2 By a Letter of Award dated 7 November 2016 (the “Subcontract”), Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd (“ZK”) engaged Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd (“DG”) as a subcontractor for the supply of materials, equipment and tools to carry out and complete the aluminium cladding of the external facade, blast/ballistic doors and windows, aluminium doors, and window works. These works were for a project for the construction of equipment buildings and facilities at the Singapore Changi Airport (the “Project”). The works under the Subcontract was divided into Phase 1 and Phase 2A works.3 According to ZK, DG began to show signs of delay in meeting the schedule for the Subcontract works sometime in February 2017. According to DG, these delays were not caused by them but by ZK and/or those further up the contractual chain. The disagreement between the parties continued in April 2018 as evidenced by email correspondence between them concerning the purchase of cabin glass that DG was obliged to install on the eight-storey Equipment Building under Phase 1 Works.4 Eventually, on 6 June 2018, DG abandoned the work site. Following another period of correspondence, ZK informed DG on 30 June 2018 that it had no choice but to engage third parties to complete the remaining works and remedy any defects on DG’s behalf, and that DG would be responsible for the consequences that would occur.5 On 28 August 2019, more than a year after DG’s letter of 29 June 2018, DG served a progress claim on ZK, demanding a sum of $261,006.74.6 On 14 September 2019, ZK commenced Suit No 917 of 2019 (“S 917”) in the High Court, claiming for the sum of $317,559.90 for “goods sold and delivered and services rendered to the [d]efendants”.  This action was commenced by ZK through its then solicitors Peter Ong Law Corporation.7 On 16 September 2019, ZK responded to DG’s progress claim for $261,006.74. ZK either declined to certify or did not certify in full the amounts claimed by DG. The reasons provided by ZK included, inter alia, that the works were not in fact done, or that the variation works claimed for were under the original scope of the Subcontract. 8 On 1 October 2019, DG commenced Adjudication Application No 339 of 2019 (“AA 339”) under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”) for the sum of $264,789.08. In ZK’s written submissions in AA 339, it was argued that DG had failed to carry out the terms of the Subcontract and that most of the works done were either incomplete, defective and/or did not go through a “final handing over process”. ZK therefore had to rectify the defects of DG’s works using third-party contractors, complete the remainder of the works and prepare the works for the final handing over. 9 An Adjudication Determination (the “AD”) was issued on 15 November 2019 where the adjudicator awarded the sum of $197,522.83 (the “Adjudicated Amount”) plus interest to DG.  As for the costs of the adjudication, the adjudicator noted that DG had succeeded on most items in the adjudication and ordered that the costs of the adjudication being the adjudication application fee of $642 (inclusive of 7% GST) and the adjudicator fee of $12,945.93 (inclusive of 7% GST), were to be borne 20% by DG and 80% by ZK.10 ZK did not make payment of the Adjudicated Amount. Instead, on 19 December 2019, ZK, without discontinuing S 917, commenced the suit below, Suit No 1282 of 2019 (“S 1282”), through another set of solicitors, Zenith Law Corporation, against DG. On 11 March 2020, on ZK’s application, S 917 and S 1282 were consolidated (the “Consolidated Suit”) under S 1282. The sums claimed in the Consolidated Suit were identical to the sums claimed when S 1282 was first commenced.11 On 17 January 2020, DG obtained a court order to enforce the AD as a judgment debt (“DC/OSS 5/2020”). DG then served a statutory demand on 7 February 2020 on ZK seeking payment of $211,044, being the Adjudicated Amount plus interest for late payment, the cost of DC/OSS 5/2020, and 80% of the costs of the adjudication within three weeks of the date of service of the demand.12 ZK filed Originating Summons No 223 of 2020 (“OS 223”) to set aside the statutory demand and in the alternative, seek an order or declaration that DG was precluded from issuing a statutory demand because S 1282 was still ongoing.13 As ZK did not meet the statutory demand within the three-week deadline, DG commenced Companies Winding Up Originating Summons No 95 of 2020 (“CWU 95”) on 23 March 2020 to wind up ZK. CWU 95 was served on ZK the following day. ZK then filed HC/SUM 1577/2020 (“SUM 1577”) to dismiss CWU 95 and alternatively, to stay, restrain, or adjourn CWU 95 until the disposal of the Consolidated Suit. Subsequently, the High Court judge dismissed OS 223 but allowed SUM 1577 and stayed CWU 95 until the determination of the Consolidated Suit and any appeal thereof. The decision to stay CWU 95 was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 21 June 2021 on condition that ZK pay into court a sum of $211,044 as security pursuant to the stay of CWU 95 (“Security Sum”).14 In the proceedings below (see [10] above), ZK claimed against DG for liquidated damages (“LD”) arising from DG’s delays. The LD claimed amounted to a total of $501,800, comprising Phase 1 works amounting to $383,400 and Phase 2A works amounting to $118,400. ZK also claimed against DG for replacement works arising from DG’s abandonment of the worksite around 6 June 2018 and for rectification works done, which came to a total of $340,233.10. ZK further sought to overturn the adjudicated amount that was awarded to DG in the AD.15 In response, DG counterclaimed for the following: (a) payments due under four variation orders (ie, DV0006 (“VO 6”), DV0008 (“VO 8”), DV00018 (“VO 18”), DV00019 (“VO 19”), collectively the “VOs”) in the amount of $65,849.45; (b) the retention sum for the Subcontract (the “Retention Sum”) in the amount of $27,902.75; (c) remainder of the Subcontract sum in the amount of $127,982.85 ($561,019.90, minus payments received of $339,136.60, the disputed VO sum of $65,849.45, and the Retention Sum of $28,051); and (d) legal costs associated with the AD.16 The Judge allowed ZK’s claims for LD in part. He allowed ZK’s claims for LD for Phase 1 works in the amount of $356,400, which was lesser than the claimed sum of $383,400, and disallowed LD for Phase 2A works amounting to $118,400. He also allowed the costs of replacement and rectification works in part, in the amount of $197,501.49 out of the $340,233.10 claimed by ZK. The Judge also dismissed ZK’s claim for overturning the main works allowed by the adjudicator in the AD. As for DG’s counterclaims, the Judge allowed DG’s counterclaim for VO 18 in the amount of $5,070 and disallowed DG’s counterclaims for VOs 6, 8 and 19. The Judge also dismissed DG’s claims for [12(b)]–[12(d)] above.The parties’ cases in these appeals17 In ZK’s appeal in CA 129, ZK makes the following contentions: (a) the Judge erred in finding that the contractual completion dates were 29 December 2017 for Phase 2A and 16 March 2018 for Phase 1; (b) the Judge erred in allowing ZK’s claim for replacement and rectification works only in part; and (c) the Judge erred in dismissing ZK’s claim for overturning the main works allowed by the adjudicator in the AD.18 In DG’s appeal in CA 125, DG makes the following contentions: (a) the LD awarded to ZK for Phase 1 should be reduced; (b) ZK is not entitled to its claims for replacement works save for item 4(c); and (c) DG is entitled to its claims for VO 6 and VO 8.19 DG also argues that the claimed sum of $297,819.49, which was described by the Judge as DG’s counterclaim for the remainder of the contract, instead represents the total works (including variation works) claimed by DG that were carried out and completed by DG under the Subcontract less the payments received from ZK. These claims therefore have been adjudicated on in the AD. Accordingly, DG argues that:a. If the Court allows DG’s appeal on VO 6 and VO 8, the Security Sum of $211,044 should be released to DG. b. If the Court affirms the Judge’s decision on the two VOs, the sum of $160,168.50 (being S$211,044 less S$50,875.50, which is the total sum allowed in AA 339 for VOs 6, 8 and 18 overturned by the Judge), should be paid to DG with accrued interest. c. Save for its claims for VOs 6 and 8, and for the release of the sums adjudicated on, DG is not seeking any further recovery for the “remainder of the contract”. d. The Judge erred in dismissing DG’s claims for the legal costs incurred for the AD. ZK’s claim for liquidated damages20 ZK submits that the Judge erred in finding that the “contractual completion dates” were stipulated by cl 6 of the Subcontract, viz, 16 March 2018 for Phase 1 and 29 December 2017 for Phase 2A. ZK submits that it is the completion dates in cl 4 that apply, viz, 31 July 2017 for Phase 1 and 20 February 2017 for Phase 2A: at [40].21 The court is of the view that under a true construction of cll 4 and 6 of the Subcontract, it is cl 6 which governs the calculation of LD and not cl 4. This can be seen from the wording of both clauses. The parties’ objective intention for cl 6 to apply is further reinforced by the fact that the dates therein coincide with the period applicable to calculating LD in the contract between ZK and its employer: at [42] to [45].22 Since cl 6 applies, LD starts to run from 29 December 2017 for Phase 2A works and from 16 March 2018 for Phase 1 works. ZK is therefore entitled to LD for Phase 1 works. Since actual completion was achieved before 29 December 2017 under cl 6, it follows that ZK is not entitled to LD for Phase 2A works: at [46] and [48].23 The Subcontract was terminated when ZK, on 30 June 2018, accepted DG’s repudiatory breach by informing DG that they would need to engage third parties to complete the remaining works. ZK is not entitled to claim LD after termination of the Subcontract. From the authorities and on first principles, this must be the case. The LD period should be reduced by a period of 92 days, being the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 September 2018 (both dates inclusive). This amounts to a reduction of $165,600: at [56], [57], [62] and [63].24 DG submits that there are three other periods of delay which are attributable to ZK and the LD period should be reduced by these three purported delay periods. These periods were not specifically pleaded and were also not specifically taken up in their submissions below. The court need not consider such a new case on appeal. In any case, from the weight of authority and on first principles, a contractor must fulfil the condition precedent for an extension of time to be availed of such an extension of time, and the contractor’s non-compliance with such a condition precedent does not prevent the employer from claiming liquidated damages. DG’s reasons for their being delayed are therefore irrelevant for the purposes of whether the LD period should be reduced: at [69], [81], [82] and [91].ZK’s claim for replacement and rectification worksDG’s appeal against the items awarded to ZK25 In the proceedings below, ZK claimed for replacement and rectification works amounting to $340,233.10, for works that were allegedly not carried out and completed by DG as a result of DG’s abandonment of the works. The Judge held that ZK was entitled to claim for items 1(a), 1(d), 1(e), 4(c) (but without 15% admin charge), 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c): at [92] and [93].26 ZK appeals against the Judge’s dismissal of its claims for items 1(b), 1(c), 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b) and 4(a). DG makes three submissions: (a) first, DG was entitled to terminate the Subcontract and therefore ZK was not entitled to any claims for the items allowed by the Judge; (b) second, even if DG had wrongfully terminated the Subcontract, ZK was not entitled to the items which the Judge had allowed save for item 4(c) and in respect of items 5(a)–(c) ZK was only entitled to claim a sum of $85,804.84; and (c) third, ZK was not entitled to impose the 15% administrative charge for items 1(d), 1(e) and 5(a): at [94] and [95].27 The court is of the view that DG’s first submission need not be considered because DG had wrongfully terminated the Subcontract. In respect of DG’s second submission, save for items 1(d) and 1(e) which will be addressed separately, DG has not been able to show any ground for appellate intervention for the other items allowed by the Judge: at [96] and [97].28 As for DG’s third submission, it was immaterial that such works were conducted after the termination of the Subcontract. Pursuant to items 16.9 and 16.10 of Annex B of the Subcontract, ZK would have been able to claim for the administrative charges if it had ordered materials or done works on DG’s behalf while the Subcontract was subsisting. The measure of damages here is to put ZK in the position it would have been in had the Subcontract been performed. ZK should be allowed to claim for the administrative charges: at [98] and [105].The parties’ cross-appeals against the items29 ZK has not shown that the Judge’s finding in respect of item 1(b) was plainly wrong or against the evidence. The documents adduced in support of item 1(b) contain an unexplained reference to a different project name: at [112] to [114].30 The Judge’s decision to disallow ZK’s claim for item 1(c) should be upheld for the same reasons applicable to item 1(b): at [116].31 There is corroborating evidence for item 1(d) but it is unclear that such evidence was adduced for item 1(e). ZK has adduced an invoice with the description of “Hired Third party to supply labour to install cabin glass” and “YJ International” for the sum of $22,540. This invoice is dated 27 September 2018, which is the same date for the invoice pertaining to Item 1(d). Hence, DG’s appeal against item 1(e) is allowed but the decision to award ZK’s claim for item 1(d) is upheld: at [124].32 ZK did not address the evidential deficiencies in its case for item 2(a) because they did not address: (a) whether the work done for a project with a different name was related to DG’s works under the Subcontract; and (b) the discrepancy between the amount in the invoice to DG and the amount paid to the replacement subcontractor. There is therefore nothing to indicate that the Judge’s finding on item 2(a) was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence: at [129] and [130].33 Like item 1(b), the purchase order for item 2(b) refers to a project of a different name and the significance of this has not been explained by ZK. In the absence of such explanation, it appears more likely that the works here relate to works that are unrelated to DG’s works under the Subcontract. The Judge’s decision to disallow ZK’s claim for item 2(b) should be upheld: at [136].34 ZK has not shown that the Judge’s finding on item 3(a) was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. It remains unclear that the works described in the documentary evidence relate to the works described under item 3(a): at [144] and [145].35 ZK has not addressed the evidential deficiencies in its claim for item 3(b). ZK has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the aluminium capping works in the quotation from the replacement subcontractor related to DG’s works. The Court therefore upholds the Judge’s decision to disallow ZK’s claim for item 3(b): at [151].36 Considering the evidence in totality, the works done by the replacement subcontractor were related to DG’s works under the Subcontract. Hence, the Court allows ZK’s appeal in respect of item 4(a): at [164].37 In respect of items 5(a)–(c), there is no evidence to show that DG would have claimed the works in question as variation works. There is also no evidence to show that delivery by sea freight are part of its Subcontract obligations. Under the Subcontract, DG would have been obliged to incur the costs for delivery by airfreight in any case, which was a more expeditious means. The Judge’s decision to award items 5(a)–(c) to ZK is therefore upheld: at [180] to [182], [185] and [186].ZK’s claim to set aside the adjudicated amount38 In the proceedings below, ZK sought to set aside the entirety of the Adjudicated Amount on the basis that the Adjudicator erred in allowing VO claims which were not agreed to by the Principal or its representative (ie, CAAS and SJ respectively), when the Subcontract requires such agreement, and that the payment for the main works (excluding the variation works) was reasonably withheld by ZK. The Judge dismissed ZK’s claim for overturning the main works allowed by the adjudicator in the AD: at [187] and [192].39 ZK has not shown, through its reliance on certain points of the evidence of one of its witness, that the Judge’s findings are plainly wrong or against weight of the evidence. The Judge’s decision to dismiss ZK’s claim for overturning the main works allowed by the adjudicator in the AD is upheld: at [204], [218], [220] and [221].DG’s counterclaim for the VOs40 The court is of the view that from the correspondence between DG and ZK as well as the parties’ conduct throughout the course of the Project, the requirement of agreement by the Project’s owner and consultant to issue variations in the Subcontract was waived by ZK. The Judge erred in concluding that VO 6, VO 8 and VO 18 ought to be set aside on the basis that there was no such waiver: at [228] to [236].41 In VO 6, work was done by DG and the late approval of the sealant led to rockwool damage which subsequently necessitated the removal and replacement of it. DG is entitled to the sum of $32,602.50 for VO 6: at [245].42 In VO 8, on a balance of probabilities, and in light of ZK’s agreement to pay for the airfreight charges, DG is entitled to the claim of $13,185.00 under VO 8: at [251] to [253].DG’s counterclaim for the Retention Sum 43 Since the Subcontract has been terminated and the disputes between DG and ZK are adjudicated and being resolved finally in these proceedings, the Retention Sum should be accounted for by setting it off against any damages awarded to ZK: at [261].DG’s counterclaim for the remainder of the Subcontract44 Given that ZK’s underlying challenge to the AD has been finally resolved in these proceedings, the Security Sum should be used to satisfy any outstanding sum owed by ZK to DG if any after setting off the sums owing to each other: at [265].DG’s counterclaim for legal costs associated with the AD45 In determining whether such legal costs may be awarded, the court or arbitral tribunal hearing the final dispute will exercise its discretion in the interests of justice between the parties. The extent to which the party seeking to claim legal costs incurred for the adjudication had ultimately succeeded in respect of the claims in the adjudication and before the court or arbitral tribunal may be of relevance. Whether costs should follow the event or the ultimate outcome or whether it should be considered issue by issue or claim by claim in considering the number and quantum of the claims which the claiming party had succeeded in to determine the extent to which the claiming party had succeeded in the adjudication is best left to the judge or arbitral tribunal seised of the disputes between the parties. There may be circumstances where it may be inappropriate to allow a claim for legal costs even if all or a substantial amount of the claims comprised in the adjudication determination are subsequently set aside: at [276] to [278].46 As DG’s claims for VO 6 and VO 8 are allowed, DG is now entitled to approximately 72.7% of the claims it made in the adjudication and DG had succeeded in the majority of claims it made. Thus, in principle, DG should be entitled to its legal costs for the adjudication. The Court therefore remits the question of DG’s entitlement to its legal costs for the adjudication as well as the quantum therefor back to the Judge for his determination: at [280]. Conclusion47 For the above reasons, the Court allows DG’s appeal in CA 125 and ZK’s appeal in CA 129 in part and the Court makes the following orders:a. The court allows DG’s appeal in part and reduces the LD awarded to ZK, ie, $356,400 for Phase 1 works by $165,600 to $190,800;b. The court allows DG’s appeal in respect of item 1(e) and sets aside the award of $5,906.40 in ZK’s favour;c. The court allows ZK’s appeal for item 4(a) and awards ZK the sum of $27,735.47 ;d. The court allows DG’s counterclaim for VO 6 and awards DG the sum of $32,602.50; e. The court allows DG’s counterclaim for VO 8 and awards DG the sum of $13,185.00; f. The court allows DG’s counterclaim for the Retention Sum and awards DG the sum of $27,902.75; andg. The court remits the question of DG’s entitlement to its legal costs for the adjudication as well as the quantum therefor back to the Judge for his determination: at [7] and [280].48 As for CWU 95, the Court orders that:a. If upon setting off all the sums owed to each other and ascertainment of the net position between the parties, there is a balance owing from ZK to DG, then all or so much of the Security Sum as shall satisfy the balance owed to DG shall be paid out to DG and the remaining balance, if any, shall be paid out to ZK;b. If upon setting off all the sums owing to each other and ascertainment of the net position between the parties, there is a balance owing from DG to ZK, then the Security Sum shall be paid out to ZK;c. Upon the ascertainment of the net balance as between the parties in accordance with (a) or (b) above, DG shall file a notice of discontinuance of CWU 95 without delay and in any case within 14 days of the ascertainment of the net position as between the parties;d. There shall be no order as to costs in CWU 95; and e. There shall be liberty to apply: at [282].
