Case summary
Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor
Magistrate’s Appeal No 9133 of 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision
of the High Court (Sundaresh Menon CJ):
Pertinent and significant points of the
judgment
·    


The High Court set out a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed).


Applying the new sentencing framework, the appellant’s aggregate sentence was reduced from 45 months’ imprisonment to 38 months’ imprisonment on appeal.



1               This
was an appeal against sentence.

Background
to the appeal
2               The
appellant (“the Appellant”) was a Russian who was 40 years old at the material
time. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 172A(1)(c) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
CCA”) and five charges under s 172A(1)(c)
read with s 172A(3) of the CCA, all of which were punishable under s 172A(2)
of the CCA. Ten charges under s 172A(1)(c) read with s 172A(3) and punishable under s 172A(2) of
the CCA were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The Appellant
was sentenced by the district judge (“the District Judge”) to an aggregate term
of 45 months’ imprisonment. This appeal, Magistrate’s Appeal No 9133
of 2017, was his appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the District
Judge.
3               The
Appellant was charged along with two of his accomplices: Skubnik Radoslav
(“Skubnik”), a Czech who was 40 years old at the material time, and Egorov
Andrei (“Egorov”), a Russian who was 33 years old at the material time.

Material
facts
4      The
Appellant was part of a Russian syndicate operating in casinos in the United
States, Europe and Macau. The syndicate targeted slot machines made by certain
manufacturers. Syndicate members would form teams comprising a “Master” (who
was the team leader) and “Players”. They would use smartphone devices to record
the play patterns of the slot machines in question. The “Master” would then
upload the recorded information to a server for analysis and decoding. The
decoded data enabled the syndicate members to predict, with some degree of
accuracy, the future outcomes of play on the targeted slot machines. 
5               The
decoded data would be sent to the “Master”, who in turn would distribute this
to the “Players”. The “Players” would then return to the same slot machines,
and the smartphone devices would alert them ahead of the next mass payout,
thereby enabling them to win at those slot machines between 60 and 65% of the
time.
6               In
March 2016, the Appellant made arrangements for some syndicate members to
travel to Singapore. These syndicate members proceeded to record the play
patterns on specific slot machines at the casinos at Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”)
and Resorts World Sentosa (“RWS”). These recordings were then analysed, and the
analysed data was given to the Appellant while he was in Russia.
7               The
Appellant taught Skubnik and Egorov how to use the smartphone devices. In April
2016, the Appellant instructed Skubnik to go to Singapore with the smartphone
devices and use them in the casinos here. He also told Skubnik that he would be
travelling to Singapore for this job. Separately, he informed Egorov of the
same. 
8               The
trio arrived in Singapore on 5 May 2016. The Appellant was the “Master”
for this job. He provided Skubnik and Egorov with the analysed data (which was
stored in a computer). Together, they visited the casinos at MBS and RWS and
identified the compromised slot machines. They then used the smartphone devices
and gained an advantage when playing at these slot machines. In accordance with
their agreement, Skubnik and Egorov would each receive about 10% of the
winnings, while the Appellant would receive about 15 to 20%. The balance would
go to the syndicate. The offences were committed between 5 and 8 May 2016.
9               Skubnik
was the first to be dealt with. He was sentenced by another district judge to
an aggregate sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment. Egorov was sentenced together
with the Appellant by the District Judge. Egorov received an aggregate sentence
of 30 months’ imprisonment. 
10             On
appeal, the Appellant submitted that an aggregate sentence of not more than
24 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in this case. The Respondent,
on the other hand, submitted that the sentence imposed by the District Judge
was not manifestly excessive.

The
applicable sentencing framework and the decision on appeal
11      Each
party sought, at least initially, to build its case primarily by relying on and
distinguishing such sentencing precedents as were available. However, the court
did not think that any of the cases relied on by the parties provided any
reliable reference points for determining the appropriate sentence to impose on
the Appellant. In the court’s view, the present appeal was not one that could
be disposed of merely by looking at the sentences imposed in the available
sentencing precedents. Rather, the court considered it necessary to approach
the matter from first principles. In this context, it was also necessary to
consider where the present case lay along the sentencing continuum provided for
under s 172A(2) of the CCA. (at [28],
[32] and [33])
12             To
this end, the court identified some of the relevant sentencing considerations
in the context of offences punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA as
follows: (at [37])

(b) 
            Voluntary restitution
 

(c) 
            Cooperation with the authorities







13             In its written judgment, the court
proposed a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 172A(2) of
the CCA. This framework comprised five steps.
14             The first step was to have regard
to the offence-specific factors and identify: (a) the level of harm caused
by the offence; and (b) the level of the offender’s culpability. The harm
caused by the offence might be categorised into one of three levels: slight,
moderate or severe. Similarly, the offender’s culpability might be categorised
into one of three levels: low, medium or high. In the court’s judgment, the
level of harm caused in this case was moderate, while the level of the
Appellant’s culpability was medium. (at [76],
[77], [90] and [98])
15             Once the sentencing court had identified
the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s
culpability, the second step was to identify the applicable indicative
sentencing range. Having regard to the sentencing range stipulated in s 172A(2)
of the CCA, the court considered the indicative sentencing ranges in the
following matrix to be appropriate: (at [78])


16      In the present case, the applicable
indicative sentencing range would be one to three years’ (or 12 to 36 months’)
imprisonment. (at [99])
17             After identifying the indicative
sentencing range, the third step was to identify the appropriate
starting point within that range. This was to be done with regard, once again,
to: (a) the level of harm caused by the offence; and (b) the level of
the offender’s culpability. In the court’s judgment, the Appellant’s sentences
should fall at the lower to middle level of the indicative sentencing range.
Accordingly, the court identified the appropriate starting points within this
range as follows: (at [79] and [100])

18             Once an appropriate starting point
within the indicative sentencing range had been identified, the fourth step
was to make such adjustments to the starting point as might be necessary to
take into account the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors. In
the court’s judgment, no further adjustments were required at the fourth step
in the present case. (at [80] and [105])
19             In cases where an offender was convicted
of multiple charges, the fifth step was to consider the need to make
further adjustments to take into account the totality principle. This applied
especially where an offender was punished with three or more sentences of
imprisonment, in which case s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code
(Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) mandated that at least two of the sentences had
to run consecutively. In such situations, further adjustments to the individual
sentences imposed on the offender might be required so as to ensure that the
aggregate sentence was not excessive. (at [81])
20             The court did not think it was necessary
or appropriate to order more than two sentences to run consecutively in the
present case. In the court’s judgment, it would be appropriate to order, as the
District Judge did, the sentence for DAC 919377/2016 and the sentence for
DAC 919395/2016 to run consecutively. This would result in a provisional
aggregate sentence of 46 months’ imprisonment. This struck the court as
possibly excessively high because it was almost double the longest individual
sentence imposed on the Appellant (namely, 24 months’ imprisonment for DAC 919377/2016).
(at [108] and [109])
21      Having regard to the overall criminality
involved, the court thought that the aggregate sentence should be reduced in
this case. In the final analysis, the totality principle was a manifestation of
the requirement of proportionality. In the court’s judgment, a term of 38 months’
imprisonment would serve this end. The court therefore reduced the individual sentences
for DAC 919377/2016 and DAC 919395/2016 to 20 months’ and 18 months’
imprisonment respectively. (at [110])
22             In the circumstances, the court set
aside the individual and aggregate sentences imposed by the District Judge, and
imposed instead the following individual sentences on the Appellant: (at [111])

23        The court ordered the sentences for DAC 919377/2016 and DAC 919395/2016 to run consecutively, making an aggregate sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment. The Appellant’s appeal was thus allowed in this regard. The court did not disturb the District Judge’s order that the sentence was to take effect from 10 May 2016. (at [112])
