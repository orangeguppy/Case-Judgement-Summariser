After the Tribunal dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant, the plaintiffs applied to set aside four paragraphs of the Tribunal’s award. The plaintiffs’ setting aside application was originally commenced in the General Division of the High Court, but this case was subsequently transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (the “SICC”). The SICC dismissed the plaintiffs’ setting aside application and directed that the parties file written submissions on costs.The material facts2 It was undisputed that the plaintiffs, having lost the setting aside application, were liable to pay costs to the defendant. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs should pay costs of S$85,000 (all-in) comprising of: (a) costs of S$25,000 prior to the transfer of the matter to the SICC (“pre-transfer costs”); (b) costs of S$45,000 following the transfer of the matter to the SICC (“post-transfer costs”); and (c) disbursements of S$15,000. While the plaintiffs did not dispute the quantum of disbursements, the plaintiffs argued that pre-transfer and post-transfer costs of S$5,000 and S$20,000 respectively should suffice.3 The plaintiffs’ factual affidavit in support of its setting aside application was 57 pages coupled with exhibits that ran to thousands of pages. The plaintiffs also adduced an expert affidavit on foreign law, to which the defendant’s Singapore counsel had to respond by engaging foreign counsel and filing its own expert evidence on foreign law. Moreover, for this setting aside application, the defendant was represented by a Senior Counsel (assisted by two lawyers), who had to spend a significant amount of time to assimilate several thousand pages in the preparation of this case.The Court’s grounds of decision4 The SICC ordered that the plaintiffs pay the defendant costs of S$85,000 (all-in), which includes S$25,000 in pre-transfer costs, S$45,000 in post-transfer costs and S$15,000 in disbursements (at [17]).5 In so far as pre-transfer costs was concerned, Appendix G provides a guideline of S$12,000 per day for contentious originating summonses not involving cross-examination. The substantive hearing for this setting aside application was scheduled for a full day, albeit in the end it only took about three hours.6 However, the SICC held that this was a case where it should exercise the discretion to depart from a strict application of Appendix G, and allow the defendant’s claim for S$25,000 in pre-transfer costs (at [10]). First, the defendant’s Singapore counsel had to review several thousand pages of exhibits attached to the plaintiffs’ supporting factual affidavit (at [7]). Second, the defendant’s Singapore counsel had to go through the foreign law evidence adduced by the plaintiffs and engage foreign counsel (at [8]). Third, the defendant did not employ two sets of counsel in different jurisdictions to perform the same tasks: the defendant’s Singapore counsel had to involve foreign counsel to understand the foreign law material adduced by the plaintiffs (at [9]). If there were any overlap in the costs claimed for Singapore and foreign counsel, the defendant’s own discounting of more than 80% of the defendant’s actual pre-transfer costs factored out such duplication (at [9]).7 The SICC also found that the post-transfer costs of S$45,000 claimed by the defendant was wholly reasonable (at [15]). Discerning what was relevant in a mass of several thousand pages would take significant time and care by the defendant’s Senior Counsel and his two assisting lawyers (at [15]). Further, the quantum of post-transfer costs claimed by the defendant was less than half of the actual post-transfer costs incurred (at [14]).This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
