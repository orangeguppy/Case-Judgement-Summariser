SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE19 November 2021Case summaryCIP v CIQ                                                           [2021] SGHC(I) 13Originating Summons No 4 of 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (delivered by Patricia Bergin IJ):Outcome: SICC dismissed application to set aside SIAC arbitral award.Background1 In 2017, the respondent, CIQ, commenced arbitral proceedings (‘the Arbitration”) with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“the SIAC”). The arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”), by a majority (“the Majority”), found in favour of the respondent and dismissed the counterclaims brought by the applicant, CIP. In its application before this court, the applicant sought to set aside the award issued by the Majority (“the Award”) on the grounds that the Majority had decided issues which were beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to the arbitration and that the Tribunal had breached the rules of natural justice.The material facts2 The applicant and the respondent were parties to a joint venture agreement (“JVA”). The purpose of the joint-venture (“JV”) was to develop a mining project (“the Project”) in the Philippines. The respondent had obtained the requisite exploration permit (“EP”) from the Philippines Mines and Geosciences Bureau (“MGB”). 3 Under the JVA, the applicant could acquire a 36% interest in the JV. The JVA also provided for the parties to enter into good faith discussions to convert the applicant’s interest in the JV into equity in the respondent. A subsequent Memorandum of Understanding gave the applicant the right to acquire an additional 6% interest in the JV. One related issue which arose was that the applicant wanted to be named as a “co-permittee” in the EP, as it took the view that it had become a 42% shareholder of the respondent. 4 Another issue that arose during the parties’ working relationship was the ownership of rights that the applicant had acquired to the land (“the Surface Rights”) within the Project zone, the subject of the JV operations. The applicant had acquired some Surface Rights within the Project zone and the respondent subsequently claimed that these acquisitions were secretive and inconsistent with the applicant’s obligations to the JV. 5 Another issue between the parties in relation to their respective obligations was the requirement for the applicant to pay certain outstanding amounts into the JV fund.6 By mid-2015, it was necessary for the EP to be renewed. An application for its renewal was lodged with the MGB on 5 May 2015. However, for various reasons, the EP expired on 11 July 2015. The applicant then suspended all drilling operations and the Project stalled.The Memorandum of Agreement7 In 2016, the parties reached a compromise in respect of the issues that had arisen between them and entered into a Memorandum of Agreement dated 10 June 2016 (“the MOA”). The parties agreed to take steps in three stages within different time frames for specified purposes.8 In Stage 1, Section 1 of the MOA, the respondent undertook to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding in the respondent. The parties agreed to provide full transparency and accounting in respect of the Surface Rights and the applicant agreed to transfer those that it had acquired to the respondent at cost plus a modest premium. These and other steps were agreed to be taken “upon the signing” of the MOA until 30 June 2016.9 In Stage 2, Section 2 of the MOA, the respondent agreed to assist the applicant to complete its due diligence of the respondent. The parties also agreed to negotiate a shareholders’ agreement (“the Shareholders’ Agreement”) in respect of the respondent’s shares. These and other steps were agreed to be taken “within 45 days” of the signing of the MOA.10 In Stage 3, Section 3 of the MOA, the parties agreed to take various other further steps “within 3 months” from the signing of the MOA.  11 Section 4 of the MOA provided that all the “proposed Stages would ultimately be conditional on satisfaction of all steps unless all parties agree to a variation in writing”.  Rescission of MOA and termination of JVA12 The parties’ relationship soured during the due diligence process with each making claims against the other of failures to comply with their respective obligations under the MOA.  13 In December 2016, the respondent informed the applicant that it was rescinding the MOA. In March 2017, the respondent elected to terminate the JVA and commenced the Arbitration shortly thereafter.The Tribunal’s proceedings and findings14 There were some preliminary applications and rulings before the substantive oral hearings before the Tribunal which took place on 16 to 20 September 2019 (both dates inclusive). In October 2019, the applicant applied to introduce new evidence, “the Surface Rights Email”. The Tribunal rejected this application. 15 In early 2020, the Tribunal sought clarification from the parties in respect of some issues relating to the nature of the alleged breaches of the MOA and clarification from the applicant on whether it was abandoning certain arguments and claims in its counterclaim. The respondent requested an oral hearing to make submissions on this issue. The further oral hearing was held on 1 April 2020 (“the Further Oral Hearing”).16 The Award was published on 21 August 2020.17 The Majority held the applicant in breach of the MOA and JVA and dismissed the applicant’s counterclaims. 18 The Majority found that the applicant had breached of the MOA by: (a) failing to remit US$200,000 to the JV; and (b) failing to provide the necessary information to the respondent on the Surface Rights and to negotiate the transfer price and sale of the Surface Rights. It had also breached the JVA by, among other things, asking to be named as a co-permittee under the EP, failing to contribute its share of the JV’s expenditures, refusing to negotiate the conversion of its 36% interest in the JV into equity in the respondent and preventing the resumption of drilling when the EP had expired.19 Besides an award of damages, the Majority ordered the applicant to provide “complete information” in respect of the Surface Rights to the respondent and transfer them to the respondent “at cost”.20 The Majority rejected the claims that the respondent had breached the MOA. In respect of the respondent’s obligations under Section 2 of the MOA to assist the applicant in its due diligence, the Majority accepted that the applicant lost the right to rely on these rights in Section 2 as it had failed to comply with its own obligations under Section 1. The Majority found that the respondent had not breached the MOA by failing to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding expeditiously. It also concluded that as both parties had not negotiated the Shareholders’ Agreement by the stipulated deadline, neither party was in breach of the MOA in this regard. The applicant abandoned a number of its claims during the Arbitration, including its claim that the respondent had breached the JVA. The Majority held that the applicant was not entitled to any relief. The setting aside application21 Before this court, the applicant contended that the Award should be set aside, pursuant to s 24 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) and Articles 34(2)(a)(ii) and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, on four grounds. 22 It submitted that the Award contained decisions that were: (a) beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to the Arbitration; and (b) made without giving the applicant a full opportunity to present its case and respond. These decisions were that: (a) the respondent was entitled to rescind the MOA even though both the applicant and the respondent had failed or refused to abide by the MOA (“Ground 1”); (b) the respondent could not be regarded as the party that breached the MOA in light of the applicant’s breaches (“Ground 2”); and (c) the applicant was to transfer the Surface Rights to the respondent at cost (“the Surface Rights Order”) (“Ground 4”). The applicant also claimed that the uneven application of procedural rules between the parties, particularly the Tribunal’s failure to allow the applicant to adduce the Surface Rights Email in evidence, breached the rules of natural justice (“Ground 3”).The court’s judgment23 In determining what was within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration, the court would have regard to five sources, being the pleadings, the agreed list of issues, opening statements, the evidence that was adduced in the arbitration and closing submissions (at [158]).Ground 124 The Majority had not found that both parties were in breach of the MOA (at [240]). 25 The fact that the articles in the Civil Code of the Philippines (“the Civil Code”) upon which each of the parties relied referred to one party breaching and the counterparty being in a position to act upon the breach did not shut out the Tribunal from considering all the circumstances surrounding each party’s conduct and consequences of that conduct (at [232]).  26 In its List of Issues, the applicant had identified the issue of whether, if the Tribunal were to find that the respondent breached the MOA, it should allow the respondent to be “rewarded” with rescission. Clearly, any consideration of whether rescission would be “rewarded” would be in the context of the applicant having committed a breach of the MOA and thus the Tribunal would be considering a circumstance of both parties being in breach of the MOA. This was not a disjunctive case. It was clearly a claim that both parties were “equally” in breach and the remedy should not be permitted (at [235] and [237]).27 In its Written Opening Submissions in the Arbitration, the applicant had also identified a provision in the Civil Code, Art 1192, which provided for consequences if both parties breached their obligations. By not pursuing this article in the remainder of the Arbitration, the applicant ran the risk of the Tribunal accepting its submission that the respondent was in breach but deciding that notwithstanding such breach the remedy of rescission was still available (at [238]).28 The Tribunal did not stray into issues that were not submitted to it for determination. Nor did it deny the applicant the opportunity to make submissions on the relevant issue (at [242]).29 Ground 1 of the applicant’s challenge failed.Ground 230 The order in which the Majority had decided the issues did not dictate the conclusions it reached. A reasonable reading of the Award as a whole demonstrated that the Majority did not cocoon itself in each separate issue or fail to give proper and global consideration to all the matters before it for determination (at [252]).31 The Majority had not applied some “deeming principle” that because the applicant had breached the MOA, the respondent could not itself have been in breach. The Majority’s conclusion that the respondent had not breached the MOA by failing to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding in the respondent followed from its earlier reasoning that because the applicant had breached its obligations in Section 1 of the MOA and the respondent had not, the former was not entitled to rely on its rights in Section 2 of the MOA (at [255] and [256]).32 Ground 2 of the applicant’s challenge failed.Ground 3 33 The applicant had been given a full opportunity to make an application to tender the Surface Rights Email and ample opportunity to make submissions in support of that tender. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had properly explained its failure to disclose the Surface Rights Email before the oral hearing. The applicant had explicitly acknowledged that it had control and possession of the Surface Rights Email before the hearing. The Tribunal also concluded that the prejudice that might be caused to the respondent could not be cured at the advanced stage of the proceedings (at [284] and [285]).34 In any event, the documents within the Surface Rights Email could not reasonably have made a difference to the Majority’s deliberations (at [289]).35 Further, the Tribunal had not breached the rules of natural justice by allowing the respondent to amend its Memorial. The Tribunal had provided each party with the opportunity to put its arguments as to whether the amendment should be permitted. Both parties took up those opportunities and neither before nor after the amendment was allowed did the applicant raise with the Tribunal that it had been prejudiced by the amendment or disadvantaged in arguing its case before the Tribunal (at [303]).36 There was also no breach of natural justice by the Tribunal’s admission of three new exhibits by the respondent before the oral hearing commenced. The applicant had not opposed the admission of these new exhibits and the Tribunal had applied itself appropriately to the respondent’s application (at [312] and [314]).37 Further, the Tribunal’s decision to hold the Further Oral Hearing did not breach the rules of natural justice as both parties were given a full opportunity to make submissions as to whether a further hearing should take place. At the Further Oral Hearing, both parties were given a full opportunity to make every submission they wished to make (at [321]).38 That the Tribunal acceded to 48 of the respondent’s 129 requests for document production but none of the applicant’s 93 requests did not evidence a breach of natural justice. Although the respondent was clearly more successful than the applicant in its applications for the production of documents, that fact alone cannot be equated to a finding that equality of treatment was lacking (at [333]).39 Ground 3 of the applicant’s challenge failed.Ground 440 The Surface Rights Order was a matter that was submitted to the Tribunal for determination. It was an order that was sought by the respondent at the outset of the Arbitration and was the subject of evidence and submissions (at [354]).41 The Majority concluded that the applicant had breached not only the JVA but also its fiduciary and trustee duties to act in the interests of the JV and to act in good faith. It then crafted the remedy that it concluded flowed from those breaches which included the Surface Rights Order (at [355]).42 Ground 4 of the applicant’s challenge failed.This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
