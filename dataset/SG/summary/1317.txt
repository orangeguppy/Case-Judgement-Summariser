SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE2 July 2021Case summaryDigi International Inc v Teraoka Seiko Co, Ltd  [2021] SGHC 165 Tribunal Appeal No 7 of 2020--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the General Division of the High Court (delivered by Justice Dedar Singh Gill):Outcome: The High Court dismisses the appeal against the Intellectual Property Adjudicator’s (“the Adjudicator”) decision to refuse the registration of the application mark under ss 8(2)(b) (application mark similar to registered mark), 8(4)(b)(i), read with 8(4)(a) (well known trade mark), and 8(7)(a) (passing off) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the TMA”). The High Court also declines to register the application mark under s 8(9) of the TMA (consent to registration) and dismissed the respondent’s cross-appeal against the Adjudicator’s decision to reject the ground of opposition under s 7(6) of the TMA (bad faith). The applicant’s mark (“Application Mark”) and opponent’s mark’s (“Respondent’s Mark (Singapore)”) in this case are as follows: Application MarkRespondent’s Mark (Singapore)Pertinent and significant points of the judgment•  The word “DIGI” was descriptive of the digital nature of the goods in the Class 9 specification of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) (at [94]). While the composite whole of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) only had a low degree of inherent distinctiveness (at [100]), the distinctiveness of the whole mark was enhanced to a moderate degree through use (at [118]). •  With regards the ground of opposition under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA (ie, application mark similar to registered mark), the Respondent’s Mark’s (Singapore) Class 9 specification and the Application Mark’s specifications in Classes 9, 38 and 42 were similar due to their complementary nature, highly similar trade channels and highly similar end-users (at [150]–[152], [163]–[164], [167]).•  With regards the ground of opposition under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA, despite the technical nature of the competing marks’ goods and/or services, there was a likelihood of confusion among the segment of the relevant public comprising sophisticated consumers (at [188]). This was due to the overall high degree of similarity of the competing marks (at [177]) and the moderate degree of similarity of the goods and/or services in the specifications of the competing marks (at [178]).•  The state of the register (eg, co-existence of the parties’ earlier marks in Singapore and outside of Singapore) is generally irrelevant to the grounds of opposition in ss 8(2)(b) and 8(7)(a) of the TMA, as was the case in this matter ( at [193] and [215]).•  With regards the ground of opposition under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA (ie, passing off), the respondent’s sale of goods and services beyond the scope of the Respondent’s Mark’s (Singapore) Class 9 specification buttressed its goodwill in Singapore and the acquired distinctiveness of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) for the purposes of the element of misrepresentation (at [200]–[201] and [203]).•  The appellant’s alleged prior use of its earlier marks containing the word “DIGI” in Singapore did not reduce the likelihood of confusion under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA as there was insufficient evidence to establish prior use of these marks in Singapore (at [219]).•  The registration for the Application Mark was not filed in bad faith as there was no cogent evidence that the appellant knew that the respondent was likely to oppose the registration or that it lacked a right to register the Application Mark (at [241]).The material facts1 In 2002, the appellant and respondent entered into an agreement (“the 2002 Agreement”), which was a settlement of a separate trade mark dispute between the parties in Germany. In the 2002 Agreement, the parties agreed not to oppose the registration, renewal and/or use of each other’s marks, which were in existence at the time of the 2002 Agreement, as long as each party kept to a demarcated scope of goods and services specified in the 2002 Agreement.2 The Application Mark was launched by the appellant on its 30th anniversary in 2015 to give its corporate logo a new brand identity and look and feel. The appellant has since obtained protection for the Application Mark outside of Singapore, including in certain territories in which the respondent has registered a mark identical to Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) (“the Overlapping Territories”).3 The Application Mark was accepted for registration in Singapore and published on 18 August 2017 for opposition purposes. The Application Mark was sought to be registered in Classes 9, 38 and 42 for goods and services which, in general, enable machine-to-machine (“M2M”) communication and network connectivity.  4 The respondent filed its Notice of Opposition on 17 October 2017 based on the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore). This mark has been registered in Class 9 for “[b]alance and scale, scale equipped with printer, printer” since 18 December 1986. 5 On 16 July 2019, about two and a half weeks prior to the hearing before the Adjudicator, the appellant wrote to the Registrar of Trade Marks to request an amendment to its Class 9 specification. It sought to replace the words “computer printer servers” with “none of the aforementioned goods relating to balance and scale, scale equipped with printer, printer”. Despite the amendment being made, the respondent proceeded with the opposition.The court’s decision on appeal6 The High Court dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal against the decision of the Adjudicator. It upheld the Adjudicator’s finding that the grounds of opposition under ss 8(2)(b), 8(7)(a) and 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA succeeded, agreed with the Adjudicator that the ground of opposition under s 7(6) of the TMA failed, and declined to register the Application Mark under s 8(9) of the TMA (at [244]).s 8(9) of the TMA: registration refused7 The 2002 Agreement did not govern the registration of marks that came into existence after the 2002 Agreement was concluded. It was irrelevant to the present application to register the Application Mark since this mark was launched only in 2015. In other words, the 2002 Agreement did not represent the respondent’s consent to the Application Mark’s registration under s 8(9) of the TMA (at [83]).8 The court found a Canadian agreement, which was entered into by the parties after the 2002 Agreement, to be irrelevant to the interpretation of the scope of the latter agreement. The provisional parameters in MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals [2019] 2 SLR 837 for determining when parties’ subsequent conduct is admissible for contractual interpretation were not met (at [75]–[82]).s 8(2)(b) of the TMA: opposition succeeded9 The word component (ie, “DIGI”) of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) was descriptive of the digital nature of the goods in the Class 9 specification of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) (at [94]). However, while the composite whole of the mark only had a low degree of inherent distinctiveness, it acquired a moderate degree of distinctiveness through use (at [100], [118]).10 At the marks-similarity stage, the court found that the competing marks were aurally identical, conceptually similar to a high degree and visually similar to a fair degree (at [134]). 11 With regards the marks’ visual similarity, there were differences in the nature and positioning of the marks’ triangle devices and the font of the marks’ word components. However, as competing marks were not to be compared side by side and given the Respondent’s Mark’s (Singapore) inherent and acquired distinctiveness, these differences were not so substantial as to distinguish the Application Mark visually (at [124]–[125]).12 The competing marks were aurally identical as both would be referred to as “DIGI” (at [127]). They were highly conceptually similar as both connoted the idea of technology and the notion of a triangle (at [132]).13 At the stage concerning the similarity of the marks’ goods and services, the Respondent’s Mark’s (Singapore) Class 9 specification and the Application Mark’s specifications in Classes 9, 38 and 42 were found to be similar due to their complementary nature, highly similar trade channels and highly similar end-users (at [150]–[152], [163]–[164], [167]).14 At the likelihood of confusion stage, the court determined that the relevant public included both the general public in Singapore and sophisticated consumers (at [174]). It concluded that there was a likelihood of confusion among a substantial portion of the relevant public (at [195]).15 When the marks’ goods and/or services were sold through physical and online trade channels, their visual and/or aural similarity made origin-based confusion likely (at [182]–[184]).16 Despite the technical nature of the marks’ goods and/or services, both the general public and sophisticated consumers (eg, business consumers, IT professionals and IT enthusiasts) were likely to be confused (at [187], [188]). This was due to the high degree of overall similarity of the competing marks and the moderate degree of similarity of the competing marks’ goods and/or services (at [188]).17 A decision by the Australian Registrar of Trade Marks (“the Australian Decision”) concerning identical iterations of the Application Mark and Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) was found to be unpersuasive in this matter generally (at [107], [191]). This was because the material statutory provisions discussed in the Australian Decision, such as ss 44 and 60 of Australia’s Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth), differed from comparable provisions in Singapore (at [107]).18 The court dismissed the relevance of the state of the register (ie, co-existence of the parties’ earlier marks in Singapore and outside of Singapore) to the grounds of opposition in ss 8(2)(b) and 8(7)(a) of the TMA in this case (at [193] and [215]). In connection with the Overlapping Territories, the court also highlighted that the respondent is entitled to elect which jurisdiction(s) to contest the registration of the Application Mark in (at [194]).s 8(7)(a) of the TMA: opposition succeeded19 The respondent’s goodwill was established by evidence of the respondent’s Singapore subsidiary’s sales and expenses incurred in promoting goods and services in Singapore (see [198]–[200]).20 The threshold requirement of distinctiveness for misrepresentation was met given the court’s earlier recognition that the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) had acquired distinctiveness. This earlier finding of acquired distinctiveness was bolstered by the fact that the respondent also sold goods beyond the scope of the Respondent’s Mark’s (Singapore) Class 9 specification in Singapore. These additional goods and services pertained to the Internet of Things or were goods with wireless capabilities (“the Respondent’s Additional Goods and Services”) (at [203]).21 With regards the likelihood of confusion under the element of misrepresentation, the Respondent’s Additional Goods and Services meant that the parties’ goods and services were not merely complementary, but were also in competition (at [211]). The appellant’s evidence also disclosed brochures featuring products catered for industries which the respondent operated in (ie, retail, food, logistics and hospitality) (at [212]). Given these factors, and the court’s earlier finding of likelihood of confusion under s 8(2)(b) (at [209]), there was a likelihood of confusion under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA. Therefore, the element of misrepresentation was established (at [213]).22 The appellant’s alleged prior use of its earlier marks containing the word “DIGI” in Singapore did not reduce the likelihood of confusion under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA as there was insufficient evidence to establish prior use of these marks in Singapore (at [219]–[223]).23 There was a likelihood of damage to the appellant’s goodwill in the form of diversion of custom (at [226]).s 8(4)(b)(i), read with s 8(4)(a) of the TMA: opposition succeeded24 The marks similarity requirement in s 8(4) was satisfied given the court’s earlier finding of the competing marks’ similarity under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA (at [229]). 25 The well known status of the Respondent’s Mark (Singapore) was not challenged on appeal, and was in fact buttressed by the sales of the Respondent’s Additional Goods and Services in Singapore (at [229]). 26 The remaining requirements in s 8(4)(b)(i) of the TMA: (a) that use of the Application Mark on goods or services that it is to be registered for will indicate a connection between those goods or services and the respondent; and (b) likely damage to the respondent’s interests, were also met given the elements of misrepresentation and likely damage in s 8(7)(a) of the TMA were satisfied (at [230]).s 7(6) of the TMA: opposition failed27 It did not constitute bad faith for a party to apply to register a trade mark merely because it knew that third parties were using the same mark in relation to identical goods or services, let alone where the third parties were using similar marks and/or were using them in relation to similar goods or services. The applicant may have believed that it had a superior right to registration and use of the mark (at [238], citing Arnold J in Hotel Cipriani SRL and others v Cipriani (Grosvenor Street) Ltd and others [2008] EWHC 3032 (Ch)).28 In this case, there was no cogent evidence that the appellant knew that the respondent was likely to oppose the registration or that it lacked a right to register the Application Mark (at [241]).The appellant had already registered a variety of trade marks incorporating the word “DIGI” in Singapore without any opposition from the respondent (at [237]). Further, the appellant’s view was that the Application Mark’s specifications complied with the parties’ demarcated scope of goods and services in the 2002 Agreement (at [240]). Conclusion29 For the reasons above, the Application Mark was denied protection in Singapore.This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
