Credit Suisse Trust Limited (“the defendant”) is the defendant in the suit.2 On 26 May 2023, the Court allowed the plaintiffs’ claims against the defendant, finding that the defendant was in breach of its duties as trustee as at 30 March 2008 (see Ivanishvili, Bidzina and others v Credit Suisse Trust [2023] SGHC(I) 9 (the “Judgment”)). The Court requested that parties’ experts update their calculations on the plaintiffs’ losses to commence from the date of breach, 30 March 2008, to the date of the Judgment, 26 May 2023, taking into account a settlement reached by the parties. The Court also indicated that it would hear parties on costs and/or interest should they be unable to reach an agreement on costs and/or interest. Following the Judgment, an issue arose between parties as to whether a declaration should be made by the Court. This decision dealt with those three matters.DecisionCompensation3 The plaintiffs’ expert’s approach is preferred as the fairest and most reasonable in the circumstances. The amount of compensation that the defendant is ordered to pay is US$742.73m: at [9] and [10].Costs4 There is no issue between parties that as the plaintiffs prevailed in the Suit, they should be awarded costs in accordance with the principle that costs should follow the event. However, there were issues as to the reasonableness of the costs as claimed and the amount of any discount that might be applied to the award of costs: at [12].5 Parties agreed on various categories of costs. However, they disagreed on the date from which interest should apply to the agreed costs. The plaintiffs contended that interest should apply to the agreed costs from the date of parties’ agreement. The defendant contended that interest on both the agreed costs and the costs determined by the Court should run from the date of the Court’s order to the date of full payment: at [171] and [172].6 The defendant agreed to pay the plaintiffs’ costs which were amounts in respect of which they had been out of pocket for some time. The plaintiffs should be compensated from the date of those agreements and interest should accrue from the dates of the agreements to the date of full payment: at [178].7 The plaintiffs sought costs from 9 March 2021 to 17 February 2023 (“Post-Transfer Costs”) in the amount of S$4,330,028.73. The defendant submitted that the plaintiffs’ costs for this period should be fixed at S$3.5m. Once the plaintiffs provided detailed information of their costs, the onus shifted to the defendant to demonstrate that the plaintiffs’ costs were unreasonable. One of the ways of demonstrating that unreasonableness was the disclosure of its own costs. The defendant did not provide details of its own costs and maintained that comparison between its costs and the plaintiffs’ costs would not be meaningful because of the significant asymmetry in the preparatory work for trial: at [44] and [50]. 8 Symmetry is not a pre-requisite to the comparison of the costs incurred by the respective parties. Even if the defendant formed the view that there was significant asymmetry, that should not have prevented it from disclosing the quantum and providing explanations in respect of the differences. Instead, the defendant chose to complain about the plaintiffs’ level of costs without permitting any comparison with its own costs: at [53] and [57].9 The plaintiffs’ claimed Post-Transfer Costs were not shown to be unreasonable: at [70], [95], [106], [117] and [137].10 The plaintiffs’ claimed Post-Transfer Costs included a 10% discount in recognition of the date of breach having been found to be in 2008 instead of in 2007. The fact that the plaintiffs did not succeed in securing a finding of breach of duty by the defendant as at 2007 with the consequential choice of model is properly reflected in the 10% discount. The plaintiffs are awarded S$4,330,028.73 for Post-Transfer Costs: at [143] and [144].11 The plaintiffs sought Quantum Experts’ Fees amounting to S$2,382,893.25. The defendant counter-proposed costs of S$1,750,000. It is not appropriate to simply compare the breakup of the fees in particular periods, without more, and to conclude that the plaintiffs’ fees were excessive. It is significant that the defendant’s Quantum Experts’ Fees totalled S$3,608,515.12, which was S$1,225,620.87 greater than the plaintiffs’ Quantum Experts’ Fees. In all the circumstances of the complexities of this case and the obvious professional and diligent approach adopted by the plaintiffs’ experts to the task to assist the Court, these fees are reasonable: at [145], [148], [157] and [158]. 12 Given that it was not deemed necessary to determine whether the Deed of Amendment and Restatement dated 5 July 2013 is void or unenforceable, it is not appropriate to make a declaration to that effect: at [181]. 13 The Court awarded US$742.73m to the plaintiffs as compensation, with simple interest of 5.33% accruing from 26 May 2023 to the date of full payment. The Court ordered that the defendant pay the plaintiffs costs of S$6,731,421.98 plus simple interest on such costs at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the judgment on costs to the date of full payment. The Court recorded the defendant’s consent to pay the plaintiffs agreed costs of S$567,471.45. The Court ordered that interest on the agreed costs accrue from the dates of the parties’ agreement on such costs, except that interests on the costs of SUM 21 shall run from 20 June 2022: at [182].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
