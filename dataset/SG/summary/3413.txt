Case summary



Ong Ming Johnson v Attorney-General and other matters [2020] SGHC 63

Originating Summons Nos 1114 of 2018; 1436 of 2018 and 1176 of 2019



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decision of the High Court (delivered by See Kee Oon J):


Outcome: HC dismisses all three applications.


Pertinent and significant points of the judgment


· Section 377A of the Penal Code was intended to safeguard public morals
generally and enable enforcement and prosecution of all forms of gross
indecency between males. It was not targeted solely at male prostitution
when it was enacted in 1938.


· Section 377A covers all forms of male homosexual activity including
penetrative and non-penetrative sex, whether in public or in private and
with or without consent.


· The presumption of constitutionality applies to s 377A as the provision
was extensively debated and retained by Parliament in 2007.


· Section 377A does not violate Article 12 of the Constitution as it was
not under- or over-inclusive. It is not appropriate to adopt a broader test
of proportionality for Article 12(1) of the Constitution.


· Section 377A does not violate Article 14(1)(a) of the
Constitution. The right to freedom of expression contained in Article
14(1)(a) must be understood to relate to the right to freedom of
speech, encompassing matters of verbal communication of an idea, opinion or
belief.


· There is no comprehensive scientific consensus as to whether a person’s
sexual orientation is immutable. The court is not the appropriate forum to
seek resolution of a scientific issue that remains controversial.


· Issues relating to how s 377A is enforced are distinct from, and should
be addressed separately from, issues relating to the constitutionality of s
377A.


· Non-enforcement of s 377A in respect of consensual male homosexual
activity in private does not render it redundant. Legislation remains
important in reflecting public sentiment and beliefs.


· The Court of Appeal’s decision in

Lim Meng Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and
another matter

[2015] 1 SLR 26 in relation to a number of the arguments raised in the
present case is binding. In any case, the Court has reached the same
conclusions that the Court of Appeal arrived at, even after taking into
account the additional material put forth by the plaintiffs.


 


Introduction


1 Mr Ong Ming Johnson, the plaintiff in HC/OS 1114/2018, sought a
declaration that s 377A of the Penal Code was inconsistent with Articles
9(1) and/or 12(1) of the Constitution. Mr Choong Chee Hong, the plaintiff
in HC/OS 1436/2018, sought a declaration that s 377A was inconsistent with
Articles 12 and/or 14 of the Constitution. Dr Tan Seng Kee, the plaintiff
in HC/OS 1176/2019, sought a declaration that s 377A violated Articles
9(1), 12(1) and 14 of the Constitution. All three matters were heard
together with the consent of all the parties.


2 The Court of Appeal had, in

Lim Meng Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and
another matter

[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“Lim Meng Suang CA”) previously found that s 377A
was meant to address public morality, as opposed to the specific problem of
male prostitution only. Additionally, s 377A covered both penetrative and
non-penetrative sexual activity. A key part of the plaintiffs’ case
consisted of challenging these findings.


Issues raised


3 The issues raised for the court’s consideration centred on:


(a) the purpose and object of s 377A, in particular whether it only covers
non-penetrative male homosexual activity and is targeted only at male
prostitution;


(b) whether the presumption of constitutionality applies to s 377A;


(c) whether s 377A was consistent with the reasonable classification test
in connection with Article 12 of the Constitution;


(d) whether there was scientific consensus that male homosexuality was
caused purely by biological factors such that s 377A violated Article 9(1)
of the Constitution;


(e) whether s 377A violated a non-derogable right to freedom of expression
under Article 14 of the Constitution;


(f) whether the continued criminalisation of male homosexual activity
through the retention of s 377A was absurd or arbitrary and hence
inconsistent with Article 9(1) of the Constitution; and


(g) whether the doctrine of stare decisis, which requires that a
lower court follow the decision of an appellate court, applies and whether
the Court of Appeal’s decision in Lim Meng Suang CA ought to be
departed from: at [19].


The court’s decision


4 The three-step framework towards statutory interpretation was articulated
by the Court of Appeal in Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General [2017]
2 SLR 850 (“Tan Cheng Bock”). The first step requires
ascertainment of the possible interpretations of a statutory provision,
having regard to its text and context within the written law as a whole: at
[32].


5 After applying the first step of the Tan Cheng Bock framework as
a starting point, the High Court found that the ordinary meaning of “gross
indecency with another male person” is wide enough to cover both
penetrative and non-penetrative sexual activity between male persons. The
words do not connote any limitation to activities involving male
prostitution or to non-penetrative sexual activity only: at [    94].


6 The Court found that s 377A was intended to be of general application,
being aimed at male homosexual practices generally, to enforce a stricter
standard of societal morality in 1938: at [96].


7 At the second and third steps of the Tan Cheng Bock framework,
the court must attempt to ascertain the legislative purpose or object of
the statute; and compare the possible interpretations of the text against
the purposes or objects of the statute: at [101].


8 While the problem of male prostitution was undoubtedly the cause of much
consternation among the British colonial administration, there was no
mention of male prostitution in any of the relevant legislative material.
The fact that a precise legislative solution was not crafted to tackle the
specific problem of male prostitution suggests that s 377A was intended for
broader application: at [112].


9 This was the case even after taking into consideration the new material
that was adduced. These materials were not presented before the Court of
Appeal in Lim Meng Suang CA and were not legislative materials but
were nevertheless considered for the sake of completeness. The new
materials were neutral and indeterminate – they did not indicate that the
purpose or object of s 377A was targeted solely at male prostitution: at [    52], [113] and [118].


10 The Court also found that s 377A was intended to cover penetrative
sexual activity, in line with the Court of Appeal’s conclusions in    Lim Meng Suang CA. Section 11 of the English Criminal Law
Amendment Act 1885, upon which s 377A was based, was used to prosecute both
penetrative and non-penetrative sexual activity. The use of s 11 was also
not confined to cases involving male prostitutes. The Penal Code itself
contains numerous examples of overlapping offences: at [123], [130], [133] and [    134].


11 The presumption of constitutionality may not operate as strongly for
Singapore’s pre-Independence laws (such as 377A) as it would compared to
post-Independence laws. However, for s 377A in particular, the presumption
of constitutionality applies with equal (if not greater) force as it does
to post-Independence laws. The purported unconstitutionality of s 377A had
been extensively debated and comprehensively considered in Parliament in
2007, with Parliament ultimately deciding to retain it: at [    150], [152] and [154].


12 The presumption of constitutionality, which is not a uniquely Singapore
creation, operates as a starting point for the court to consider a piece of
legislation. While the question of whether the Constitution is violated is
within the exclusive purview of the courts, the latter can recognise, as an
underlying premise, that the Legislature is best placed to understand and
represent the interests of Singapore citizens. Additionally, the
presumption of constitutionality does not conflict with the presumption of
innocence as one relates to the validity of a law while the other concerns
proof of guilt: at [159], [160] and [    162].


13 The reasonable classification test under Article 12(1) requires the
court to examine if there is an intelligible differentia and if the
differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by
the legislation. The key question in relation to whether there is an
intelligible differentia is whether targeting of sexual conduct between
males is so unreasonable as to be illogical and/or incoherent. Considering
that distinctions have been drawn between men and women in various areas
within Singapore law, the differentia adopted in s 377A cannot be said to
be so unreasonable such that it is unintelligible: at [170
], [171], [172] and [174
].


14 Section 377A also could not be said to be either under- or
over-inclusive. There is no need for a perfect coincidence between the
differentia used and the object sought to be achieved. The plaintiffs had
argued that s 377A excluded female homosexual conduct and other conduct
which harms public morals. At the same time, it targeted conduct in private
that did not harm public morals. However, as the Court of Appeal noted in    Lim Meng Suang CA, there was a complete coincidence in the
differentia and object of s 377A. The purpose of s 377A is the
criminalisation of male homosexual conduct to safeguard public morals
generally and reflect societal morality. The differentia serves to
criminalise only acts of gross indecency between male persons. It was for
Parliament, rather than the courts, to be responsible for the determination
of public morality: at [183], [188], [    189] and [192].


15 As for the argument that s 377A was over-inclusive, the Court found that
the plaintiffs had erred in presupposing that conduct in private could be
divorced from precepts of public morality. This was not the case – private
acts of incest or bestiality are criminalised under Singapore law due to
concerns over the degeneration of public morality: at [193
].


16 There are limitations to the reasonable classification test insofar as
it operates as a threshold inquiry. The courts should not adopt a broader
test of proportionality in relation to Article 12(1) of the Constitution as
this would necessarily entail the risk of the courts usurping the
legislative function or acting like a “mini-legislature”. The courts ought
not take into consideration extra-legal arguments, regardless of how valid
or plausible they may seem to be: at [210], [    211], [216] and [223].


17 Section 377A did not violate Article 14(1)(a) of the
Constitution. The right to freedom of expression in Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution relates to the right to freedom of speech    ie the verbal communication of an idea, opinion or belief. The
marginal note to Article 14, the structure of Article 14 as well as
principles of statutory construction demonstrate that freedom of expression
is not a free-standing right divorced from freedom of speech. This is
further supported by the Report of the Constitutional Commission 1966: at [246], [255], [258] and [    259].


18 The Court found that there was no comprehensive scientific consensus
that a person’s sexual orientation was biologically determined such that it
is immutable. Instead, the scientific literature suggested that a person’s
sexual orientation was determined by both genetic and environmental
factors. The court is not the appropriate forum to seek a resolution of a
scientific issue that remains controversial. This is in any event an
extra-legal argument that does not come under the proper purview of the
courts: at [277] and [279].


19 The Court also found that the continued criminalisation of s 377A was
not absurd or arbitrary and did not violate Article 9 of the Constitution.
While the plaintiffs argued that s 377A criminalises male homosexuals on
account of their ingrained identity or sexual orientation, s 377A
criminalises acts of gross indecency rather than the identity or status of
a male homosexual: at [281] and [282].


20 Additionally, the Singapore Government’s decision not to proactively
enforce s 377A did not mean that s 377A was absurd or arbitrary. The manner
in which a provision is enforced, even if arbitrary, cannot, without more,
result in the provision itself being rendered unconstitutional. Arguments
on the absurdity and arbitrariness of the decision not to proactively
enforce s 377A ought to be considered in an application for administrative
review, not constitutional review. In any case, the Attorney-General had
provided a degree of guidance as to when the police would take steps to
conduct investigations to enforce s 377A in appropriate cases: at [    287] and [288].


21 The Court held that s 377A could not be said to be redundant simply
because of the Singapore Government’s stance of non-enforcement in respect
of consensual male homosexual activity in private. Statutory provisions
serve an important role in reflecting public sentiment and beliefs. Section
377A, in particular, serves the purpose of safeguarding public morality by
showing societal moral disapproval of male homosexual acts: at [    295], [296] and [298].


22 The Court noted that pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis,
it was bound by the Court of Appeal’s reasoning and conclusions in    Lim Meng Suang CA in relation to the purpose or object of s 377A
as well as its scope. The Court of Appeal’s finding on the scope of s 377A
was necessary in order to make out its finding as to the purpose of s 377A.
In any case, the Court had reached the same conclusions that the Court of
Appeal arrived at, even after taking into account the additional material
put forth by the plaintiffs: at [305], [    306].


23 It would not be appropriate to depart from the well-established doctrine
of vertical stare decisis in Singapore. The Supreme Court of
Canada’s decisions in Canada (Attorney General) v Bedford [2013] 3
S.C.R. 1101 (“Bedford”) and    Carter v Canada (Attorney General) [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331 sought to
permit exceptions to vertical stare decisis where there was a new
legal issue raised or a significant change in the circumstances or
evidence. However, adopting this approach had the potential to severely
erode certainty in the law. It would not be possible to confine an
application of Bedford to constitutional law only. The integrity
of vertical stare decisis ought to be preserved and maintained: at [310], [311], [313] and [    314].
