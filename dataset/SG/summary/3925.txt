Case summary
Abhilash s/o Kunchian Krishnan v Yeo Hock Huat and another [2019] SGCA 14 
Civil Appeal No 42 of 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Steven Chong):
<CoA dismisses appeal to value a company on the basis of a third-party offer> 
1          This was an appeal against the decision of a High Court Judge to value a company on a net assets basis. 
Background to the appeal
2          The appellant, Mr Abhilash s/o Kunchian Krishnan (“Mr Abhilash”), and the first respondent, Mr Yeo Hock Huat (“Mr Yeo”), were shareholders in the second respondent, a company named JCS-Vanetech Pte Ltd (“JCSV”). Mr Abhilash initially commenced proceedings against Mr Yeo for minority oppression. On the first day of the trial, the parties entered into a consent order to the effect that the issue of liability for minority oppression would be dispensed with, and that the court shall proceed to determine the fair market valuation of JCSV, as at 30 April 2016, for the purposes of the sale and purchase of Mr Abhilash’s shares in JCSV (“the Consent Order”). 
2          At the trial, the parties procured experts to give evidence on the valuation of JCSV. Mr Abhilash called Mr Bakthavatsalam Sridhar Rao (“Mr Rao”), while Mr Yeo called Mr Thio Khiaw Ping Kelvin (“Mr Thio”). Mr Rao valued JCSV at $39,649,308 on an income method, $24,633,006 on a net assets basis, and $75,699,572 on an investment value basis. Mr Thio’s valuation yielded a mere $109,589 on a net assets basis, and, in his view, an income approach was not viable given JCSV’s loss-making history (at [21]).
3          At the conclusion of the trial, the Judge accepted Mr Thio’s valuation on a net assets basis as the fair market valuation of JCSV. Mr Abhilash appealed against the Judge’s decision. On appeal, he raised a new valuation basis. He argued that JCSV ought to be valued on the basis of an offer made by a third-party, a Chinese entity named Shanghai Ossen Aviation Technology Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Ossen), to acquire JCSV at $50m (“the Shanghai Ossen offer”). The Shanghai Ossen offer comprised an offer to purchase all the shares of JCSV for $10m in cash, and $40m in equity in a joint venture company to be set up, named Shanghai Jiashi Aerospace Power Technology Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Jiashi”). The Shanghai Ossen offer was also expressed to be subject to due diligence. Due diligence was eventually never carried out. The crux of Mr Abhilash’s argument on appeal was that the Consent Order stipulated that JCSV be valued as at 30 April 2016. As of that date, the Shanghai Ossen offer was still alive, and there was nothing to indicate that due diligence would turn up any adverse findings. Consequently, the court should take cognizance of the mere fact of the Shanghai Ossen offer being in and of itself the best evidence of JCSV’s fair market value (at [14]–[20], [24]–[27] and [31]–[32]).
Decision on appeal
4          The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Abhilash’s appeal, and upheld the Judge’s valuation of JCSV (at [100]–[101]).
5          Mr Abhilash first had to seek leave to introduce the new points that he wished to raise on appeal. These new points pertained to his argument that the Shanghai Ossen offer was directly relevant to the fair market value of JCSV, and that it was irrelevant if the Shanghai Ossen offer had evaporated because the Consent Order mandated that JCSV be valued as at 30 April 2016. The Court of Appeal granted leave for Mr Abhilash to introduce these new points on appeal, observing that both points involved questions of law and could be decided without further evidence (at [36]–[43]).
6          Although the Court of Appeal accepted that the Consent Order stipulated that JCSV should be valued as at 30 April 2016, it did not follow that the Shanghai Ossen offer would constitute the “best evidence” of JCSV’s fair market value just because the offer was alive then (at [52]). The Court of Appeal observed that, in general, an offer to acquire a company’s shares may provide some evidence of the value of those shares, but that is not a rule that applies invariably. The weight to be ascribed to such offers has to be determined on the facts of each case, specifically, the terms and nature of the offer (at [53] and [74]). In this appeal, the Shanghai Ossen offer was not determinative of the fair market value of JCSV for four reasons: 
a.         First, neither of the experts called by the parties took the view that the Shanghai Ossen offer was determinative of the fair market value of JCSV (at [87]).
b.         Second, the Shanghai Ossen offer was at all material times expressly subject to due diligence. The Shanghai Ossen offer could not be taken as a definitive or concrete offer to acquire JCSV for $50m simply because nothing appeared to be amiss at the time (at [91]–[94]).
c.         Third, the Shanghai Ossen offer was not an offer for $50m in cash, but was in fact an offer for $10m in cash coupled with $40m in equity in Shanghai Jiashi. Mr Abhilash’s case based on the Shanghai Ossen offer proceeded on the assumption that the entire $50m was liquid. If accepted, that would have translated into an immediate windfall for him (at [95]–[96]).
d.         Fourth, the Shanghai Ossen offer would at best indicate the investment value of JCSV to Shanghai Ossen, and not its fair market value. The investment value of a company exists only from the perspective of that investor, and is distinct from the fair market value of a company. Further, the investment value of a company is typically at a premium to the fair market value of a company. (at [82]–[84] and [97]–[99]).
