
SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE
12 February 2018
Case Summary
Gopu Jaya Raman v Public
Prosecutor [2018] SGCA 9
Criminal Appeal No 40 of 2016
____________________________________________________________________
Background
1          This
was an appeal by Gopu Jaya Raman (“the Appellant”), who was sentenced to death
in the High Court after being convicted of a single charge under s 7 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) for the unauthorised importation
of diamorphine, against his conviction and sentence. The primary issue in this
appeal was whether the Appellant could rebut the presumption of possession
under s 21 of the MDA. This presumption arose because the Appellant had been
arrested with three bundles containing prohibited drugs found hidden in the
motorcycle that he had borrowed to ride into Singapore, and his defence was
that the drugs had been planted in the motorcycle without his knowledge. The
Appellant was thus required to show, on the balance of probabilities, that he
did not know that the drugs were hidden in his motorcycle.
2          A
majority of the Court of Appeal (consisting of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon
and Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash, with Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang
dissenting) acquitted the Appellant of the charge, finding that the Appellant
has succeeded in rebutting the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA
on the balance of probabilities.
The
material facts
3          The
Appellant had ridden into Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint on a
motorcycle on 24 March 2014. Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) officers
at the checkpoint discovered three bundles containing prohibited drugs concealed
in a space enclosed by the motorcycle’s fenders. The Appellant appeared
confused and lost when confronted with the discovery, and denied ownership of
the bundles. 
4          In
the contemporaneous statement taken by officers from the Central Narcotics
Bureau (“CNB”) shortly after his arrest, the Appellant maintained his lack of
knowledge of the bundles, and shared that he had borrowed the motorcycle from
one “Ganesh” by collecting it from one “Ah Boy”, who was an associate of Ganesh.
The CNB officers then carried out a follow-up operation aimed at apprehending
potential recipients of the drugs from the Appellant. During the operation, the
Appellant was instructed to communicate with Ganesh, who the Appellant believed
had arranged for the drugs to be planted in the motorcycle. The CNB officers
monitored the Appellant’s conversations with Ganesh, but no audio recordings
were made.
5          In
three subsequent statements taken by the CNB, the Appellant acknowledged that
he had carried out drug deliveries on two previous occasions, but consistently denied
any knowledge of the bundles on this occasion. He also explained that he had
come to Singapore to visit his girlfriend and another friend in order to
celebrate his birthday. Next, he claimed that when he stopped to refuel the
motorcycle before reaching the Causeway, he had checked the seat compartment
portion of the motorcycle which was located just above the space enclosed by
the fenders (and which was where the drugs had been kept during the two
previous deliveries), but found nothing there. Further, he mentioned that while
he was riding on the Causeway towards Singapore, he received a call from Ganesh
who asked him to call him when he arrived in Singapore. When he asked Ganesh
why, he was told that the “recipients changed their contact numbers”. Finally,
the Appellant claimed that during the CNB’s follow-up operation, he had been
directed by the CNB officer monitoring his conversation with Ganesh to draft a
text message to Ganesh complaining that Ganesh had not previously told the
Appellant about the drugs; this showed that the officer had also formed the
impression that the Appellant did not in fact have knowledge of the drugs.
6          The
Appellant’s defence was that he did not know that drugs had been hidden in the motorcycle
because they had been planted there without his knowledge. In support of this,
the Appellant argued that: (a) he had been candid and consistent throughout the
investigation proceedings, and even voluntarily revealed that he had made two
previous drug deliveries; (b) his conduct upon arrest and during the follow-up
operation was consistent with that of a person who was unaware of the drugs;
and (c) the CNB officers had heard his conversations with Ganesh during CNB’s
follow-up operations, which strongly corroborated the Appellant’s lack of
knowledge of the drugs.
7          The
High Court judge (“the Judge”) rejected his defence and found him guilty of the
charge. As the Appellant did not receive a certificate of substantive
assistance, the Judge sentenced him to death. The Appellant appealed against
both his conviction and sentence.
Decision
of the majority (delivered by Menon CJ on behalf of Prakash JA and himself)
8          The
majority disagreed with the Judge below, and held that the Appellant should be
acquitted of the charge. They were satisfied that the Appellant has succeeded
in rebutting the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA by proving, on
the balance of probabilities, that the drugs in the three bundles were not in
his possession because they had been planted in his motorcycle without his
knowledge. ([23], [91], [94])
Reasons
for the majority’s decision
9          The
majority prefaced its judgment by emphasising that the court should bear in
mind the inherent difficulties of proving a negative when evaluating the
evidence to determine whether an offender has been able to rebut the relevant
presumptions in the MDA raised against him or her, and that the burden placed
on the offender should not be so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible
to discharge. In this regard, the majority also cautioned that the court should
be mindful of the importance of not approaching its assessment of the evidence
having, consciously or otherwise, already adopted a certain starting premise in
its analysis. A fact that is consistent with two contrasting possibilities
should be regarded as probatively neutral, with no predilection for either
conclusion, even if a statutory presumption is in operation. ([2], [24]–[25])
10        The
majority arrived at its conclusion to acquit the Appellant on the basis of: (a)
the totality of the evidence including, in particular, the evidence of the
Appellant’s conversations with Ganesh during the follow-up operation; and (b) the
absence of any objective evidence linking the Appellant to the drugs. While it
was clear that Ganesh and Ah Boy wanted to transport the drugs into Singapore,
the evidence showed that the Appellant was not part of this plan. ([23], [92]–[93]) 
11        In
particular, the majority made the following findings:
a          It was not implausible for Ganesh to
lend the Appellant RM150 and the motorcycle and for Ah Boy to lend the
Appellant the SIM card, even though the Appellant had refused to continue
delivering drugs for Ganesh to pay off the loan that the Appellant had previously
obtained from Ganesh. Ganesh and Ah Boy could have been taking advantage of the
Appellant’s simple-mindedness to facilitate a drug delivery in Singapore. ([48]–[51])
            b          While the Appellant was suspicious
after Ganesh’s phone call to him while he was on the Causeway, it would not be
proper or fair to suggest that the Appellant knew that there were drugs hidden in the motorcycle on the basis of
that phone call. ([52]–[55])
            c          During the CNB’s follow-up operation,
the CNB officers did observe that the Appellant had asked Ganesh why he had put
the drugs in the motorcycle without informing him, which Ganesh did not refute.
The Appellant’s account was corroborated by the CNB officer’s contemporaneous
investigation diary, the Appellant’s cautioned statement, and the contents of
the text message that the Appellant was instructed to send to Ganesh. ([56]–[72])
            d         There was no basis for the Judge to
conclude that there was a prior arrangement among Ganesh, Ah Boy and the Appellant to deliver the drugs
on the present occasion. ([73]–[81])
            e          The Appellant’s account was corroborated
by the objective evidence. The absence of any trace of the Appellant’s DNA on
the bundles or any of the relevant parts of the motorcycle showed that there
was no objective evidence establishing that the Appellant had hidden the drugs
in the motorcycle. ([82]–[86])
            f           It was not implausible that the
Appellant had come to Singapore on an impromptu basis hoping to meet his friend
or his girlfriend. ([87]–[90])
Decision
of the minority (delivered by Tay JA)
12        Tay JA agreed with the Judge below that
the Appellant is guilty as charged, and would dismiss the appeal against the
conviction. As the death penalty was also mandatory on the facts, Tay JA would
also dismiss the appeal against sentence. ([99],
[139])
Reasons for the minority’s decision
13        The Appellant’s evidence, taken as a
whole, showed that the Appellant knew that the bundles of drugs had been hidden
in the motorcycle, and therefore could not rebut the statutory presumption
against him under s 21 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. The evidence
pointed clearly to the conclusion that this was the Appellant’s third drug
delivery or import into Singapore to repay the loan that he had taken from
Ganesh. ([120], [137])
14        In reaching this conclusion, Tay JA made
the following findings:
            a          The
Appellant’s explanations for wanting to come to Singapore in the evening of 24
March 2014 and for how he had managed to borrow the motorcycle and RM150 from
Ganesh and Ah Boy were not believable, undermined the Appellant’s credibility,
and cast serious doubts on his claims that he did not know that the drugs were
hidden in the motorcycle. ([121]–[128])
            b          The
Appellant’s self-inculpatory statements that he had imported drugs into
Singapore on two earlier occasions did not necessarily bolster his credibility,
since nothing had been said about the nature or quantity of the drugs on those
occasions. ([129])
            c          The
telephone calls made and messages sent between the Appellant and Ganesh during
the CNB’s follow-up operations did not corroborate the Appellant’s story that
he did not know that there were drugs hidden in the motorcycle. ([130]–[132])
            d          The
fact that the Appellant failed to inform the ICA officers of his suspicions
that there might be drugs hidden in the motorcycle before they conducted their
search of the motorcycle undermined the credibility of the Appellant, because
that would have been the obvious course of action taken by an innocent man. ([135])
            e          Although
the DNA evidence was inconclusive on whether the Appellant was the person who
had concealed the drugs in the motorcycle, that alone did not mean that he did
not know that there were drugs in the motorcycle when he took possession of it
from Ah Boy. ([136])
