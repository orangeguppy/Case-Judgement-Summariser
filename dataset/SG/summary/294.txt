SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE28 June 2023Case summaryCSW v CSX [2023] SGHC(A) 23Appellate Division of the High Court – Civil Appeal No 92 of 2022--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court (delivered by Woo Bih Li JAD):Outcome: The Appellate Division of the High Court dismissed the appeal. Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:•  Therapeutic justice in the family justice system reflects the overarching goal of the family justice system to aid the parties and their children to achieve as much healing as possible in order that they move forward as positively as possible with their lives. It extends far beyond merely interviewing the children or sending the children for counselling: at [82].•  In the context of committal proceedings, where one party had blatantly and persistently disregarded the court’s orders, she cannot brandish the concept of therapeutic justice as an excuse or justification for her breaches. To do so is not only inimical to the notion of therapeutic justice, but also obstructs the administration of justice in the courts: at [85].Background to the application and material facts1 The appellant (the “Wife”) and the respondent (the “Husband”) were married on 22 February 2006. The Wife filed for divorce on 2 May 2012. The interim judgment for divorce was granted on 5 August 2013. The parties have two children to the marriage, C1 and C2, who were 16 and 14 years old respectively as at the date of the hearing of the appeal on  12 April 2023 (collectively, the “Children”). 2. The ancillary matters for divorce were heard before a district judge. On 10 June 2014, the district judge ordered the parties to have joint custody of the Children, with sole care and control to the Husband and liberal access to the Wife (the “2014 Family Court Order”). Under paragraph 3(c) of the 2014 Family Court Order, the Wife was to pick up and return the Children to the Husband’s residence after her access.3. Both parties appealed against the district judge’s decision. On 26 November 2014, the High Court ordered that sole care and control of the Children were to remain with the Husband. The High Court granted the Wife an additional day of weekday access on Wednesdays (the “2014 High Court Order”). The 2014 High Court Order also stated that (a) the Wife will pick the Children up from their school for her weekday access and the Husband will pick the Children up from the Wife’s place between 6.30pm to 7.30pm; and (b) paragraph 3(c) of the 2014 Family Court Order was redundant.4. From 26 November 2014 to 4 May 2021, the parties complied with the care and control and access arrangements in the 2014 High Court Order read with the 2014 Family Court Order (collective, the “2014 Orders”).5. On 20 January 2021, the Wife wrote an email to Minister Desmond Lee alleging that the Husband was physically and mentally abusing the Children. Subsequently, Child Protection Services (“CPS”) became involved. After some investigations, CPS decided not to take action. On 27 April 2021, the Wife wrote to Minister Desmond Lee again essentially repeating her allegations against the Husband. This prompted one Ms Belinda from CPS to contact the Wife again on 29 April 2021 to request for further information.6. On 4 May 2021, at 12.56pm, Ms Belinda called the Wife and informed her that CPS had decided to speak to the Husband about their ongoing investigations against him. The Wife pleaded with Ms Belinda to only inform the Husband the next day, 5 May 2021, which was her birthday. The Wife wished to speak to the Children first before CPS informed the Husband about the ongoing investigations against him. Ms Belinda acceded to her request. On 4 May 2021, at 2.51pm, the Wife sent an email to the Husband reminding him that she has birthday access the next day and that she would be sending the Children back to the Husband’s place at 8.30pm after her birthday access.7. On 5 May 2021, the Wife sought from the Family Court a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) and an Expedited Order (“EO”) against the Husband to restrain the Husband from committing family violence against the Children. Her EO application was dismissed on the same day. Her PPO application was later heard by a district judge over a period of seven days from 9 September 2021 to 29 March 2022 and dismissed with costs on 29 March 2022. 8. Despite her EO application being dismissed on 5 May 2021, the Wife did not return the Children to the Husband after her birthday access ended at 8.30pm that day. The Husband went to the Wife’s residence with the police at around 10.00pm that day but the Children did not return home with the Husband that night.9. On 11 May 2021, the Wife applied to reverse the care and control of the Children to herself, and for interim care and control of the Children pending the full and final adjudication of her variation application. On 2 June 2021, the Husband applied for an order for the Wife to return the Children to him. On 14 June 2021, the Judge heard both parties’ applications and dismissed the Wife’s application for interim care and control. The Judge made no orders on the Husband’s application but exhorted parties to revert to the arrangements under the existing orders of court. However, the Wife still did not return the Children to the Husband. The Husband subsequently visited the Wife’s residence on 14 June 2021, 25 June 2021 and 30 July 2021 to get the Children to return home with him, but his attempts were unsuccessful.10. On 20 October 2021, the Judge heard some other applications between the parties. The Children were still not back with the Husband. The Judge then made specific orders for the Wife to return the Children to the Husband the next day on 21 October 2021 for the handover to be carried out at the Family Court premises (“the 20 October 2021 Order”). 11. On 21 October 2021, the Wife did bring the Children to the Family Court premises. The Children stayed at the venue for some hours but eventually refused to return home with the Husband. The Husband’s brother tried to persuade the Children to return to his home instead, but he was also unsuccessful. The Husband’s brother testified that the Children were initially willing to return home with him, but their attitude changed after C2 made a phone call to the Wife. Eventually, the Husband left and the Wife returned to the Family Court premises to take the Children back with her. 12. On 18 November 2021, the Husband applied for leave to commence committal proceedings against the Wife. Leave was granted on 2 December 2021 and the Husband thereafter commenced committal proceedings against the Wife on 15 December 2021. 13. On 14 February 2022, at the first hearing of the committing proceedings, the Wife asked that the hearing be adjourned until after the outcome of her PPO application. She indicated that if her PPO application failed, she would advise the Children to return to the Husband. As mentioned above, the Wife’s PPO application was dismissed with costs on 29 March 2022. The key findings of the district judge who dismissed the Wife’s PPO application were that (a) the Husband did not commit acts of family violence against the Children; and (b) the Wife had coached the Children in their claims about the alleged physical abuse. However, even after her PPO application was dismissed, the Wife still did not return the Children to the Husband.14.  On 8 April 2022, at the second hearing of the committal proceedings, the Judge was apprised of the fact that the Wife had still not returned the Children to the Husband. The Judge made a further order for the Wife to return the Children to the Husband’s residence on 9 April 2022. On 9 April 2022, the Wife did bring the Children to the Husband’s residence, but the Children still did not return to the Husband. 15. On 29 April 2022, the Judge found that the Wife acted in contempt of court starting from her birthday on 5 May 2021 when she did not return the Children to the Husband. On 9 May 2022, the Judge sentenced the Wife to one week imprisonment for her contempt. The sentence was suspended on condition that the Wife (a) successfully returned the Children to the Husband’s residence by 7pm on 10 May 2022; and (b) thereafter, complied with the relevant court orders on care and control and access. This time, the Wife duly returned the Children to the Husband’s residence on 10 May 2022.  16.   On 23 June 2022, the Wife appealed against the Judge’s decision. The decision of the Court 17. On appeal, the Wife’s main arguments were that (a) the 2014 High Court Order required the Husband to “pick up” the Children, not for her to “return” the Children, and she should not be faulted if the Children refused to return to the Husband; (b) she had no intention to breach any court orders; (c) the Judge erred in failing to implement measures to facilitate therapeutic justice, such as interviewing the Children or sending the Children for counselling, before finding her liable for contempt; and (d) the custodial sentence imposed by the Judge was manifestly excessive. The Court dismissed the Wife’s appeal in its entirety: at [39] and [40].18. First, the Court found the Wife’s interpretation of the 2014 Orders untenable. Although the 2014 High Court Order stated that paragraph 3(c) of the 2014 Family Court Order was “redundant”, that only meant that the High Court considered that the Family Court’s orders on transport arrangements were unnecessary in light of the High Court’s new orders on the transport arrangements for the Wife’s weekday access. There was nothing to suggest that the High Court sought to reverse the transport arrangements for the Wife’s weekend access or birthday access. The Wife was therefore required to return the Children to the Husband’s residence on 5 May 2021 after her birthday access: at [52] and [53].19. Furthermore, the 2014 Orders were clear that the Husband was vested with sole care and control of the Children. The parties were able to comply with the 2014 Orders with little difficulty for six and a half years between 26 November 2014 to 4 May 2021. Even on 4 May 2021, the Wife emailed the Husband stating that she would return the Children to the Husband’s residence after her birthday access ended on 5 May 2021. Her reliance on the alleged ambiguities in the 2014 Orders was nothing more than a desperate attempt to justify her conduct on 5 May 2021: at [54] and [56].20. Second, the Court found that the Wife breached the court orders intentionally. The Court affirmed the Judge’s finding that the Wife had influenced the Children not to return to the Husband. This was because (a) the Children stayed with the Husband for several years prior to 5 May 2021 without much ado, but displayed a complete change in attitude on 5 May 2021, which appeared to be the result of external influence; (b) on 21 October 2021, the Children were initially keen to go over to the Husband’s brother’s house, but their attitude changed after C2 made a phone call to the Wife; and (c) an adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife for failing to comply with the Judge’s direction to disclose communications between the Children and her from 5 May 2021 to 20 October 2021. The Wife’s active role in influencing the Children not to return to the Husband was evidence of her intentional breach of the court orders: at [64], [69], [70] and [72].21. Moreover, the Wife’s conduct on 4 May 2021 suggested that she planned to keep the Husband in the dark about CPS’s investigation against him so that she could secure the Children on her birthday, 5 May 2021, before making the necessary applications for the Children to remain with her. Her numerous applications for the EO, PPO and interim variation suggested that she knew that she was not entitled to keep the Children with her under the existing 2014 Orders. Despite her knowledge, she continued to keep the Children away from the Husband. This suggested that her breach was nothing short of intentional: at [76], [77] and [79].22. Third, with respect to the Wife’s argument that the Judge erred in not implementing measures to facilitate therapeutic justice, the Court was of the view that the Wife had misused the concept of therapeutic justice. Therapeutic justice in the family justice system extends far beyond merely hearing the voice of the children or sending the children for counselling. It reflects the overarching goal of the family justice system to aid the parties and their children to achieve as much healing as possible in order that they move forward as positively as possible with their lives. The Wife’s conduct in the present case, by involving the machinery of the state for what was essentially a parental disagreement, exposing the Children to acrimonious PPO proceedings and influencing the Children not to return to the Husband, was contrary to the very conduct required by a therapeutic justice system: at [84].23. Furthermore, the Wife’s requests for the Children to be interviewed or sent to counselling were made during her committal proceedings while she was still acting in continuing breach of the Judge’s direct orders to return the Children to the Husband. By then, she had already deprived the Husband of any access to the Children for almost a year. Having blatantly and persistently disregarded the court’s orders, the Wife cannot brandish the concept of therapeutic justice as an excuse or justification for her breaches. To do so is not only inimical to the notion of therapeutic justice, but also obstructs the administration of justice in the courts: at [84] and [85].24. Lastly, the Court found that the custodial sentence imposed by the Judge was not manifestly excessive. Considering the degree of continuity of the Wife’s contemptuous conduct, the nature of her non-compliance, and the lack of any genuine attempts to comply with the court orders, the Court found that coercive considerations would come into play and a custodial sentence was warranted. Moreover, the custodial sentence was suspended on the conditions that the Wife successfully returns the Children to the Husband the next day and thereafter, comply with the relevant court orders. This suggested that the Judge was minded to give the Wife one last chance to comply with the court orders to avoid imprisonment. In these circumstances, the Wife failed to show why the suspended custodial sentence was in any way excessive: at [89] and [91].
