SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE31 October 2023Case summaryCYW v CYX [2023] SGHC(I) 17Singapore International Commercial Court — Originating Application No 3 of 2022 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (delivered by Thomas Bathurst IJ):Outcome: SICC awarded costs of S$174,734.41 to the respondent which successfully resisted an application to set aside an arbitral award. Background 1 These proceedings arose out of an arbitration between the applicant, CYW, and the respondent CYX. In CYW v CYX [2023] SGHC(I) 10, the court dismissed CYW’s application to set aside the award made in the arbitration between the parties and ordered CYW to pay the costs of CYX. This judgment pertained to the quantum of costs.Decision of the courtPre-transfer costs 2 In relation to the costs incurred prior to the transfer of the proceedings to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”), CYX claimed a total of S$23,433.90 comprising S$23,443.70 inclusive of GST. The principal basis on which CYX relied to claim the entire amount, notwithstanding the range stipulated in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“Appendix G”), is clause 14.2 of a security deed between the parties (the “Security Deed”) which provided for indemnity costs in CYX’s favour: at [18] and [31]. 3 The authorities did not stand for the proposition that in circumstances which include a contractual indemnity for costs, Appendix G can be disregarded in the assessment of pre-transfer costs. While a contractual clause providing for indemnity costs is a relevant factor in assessing the quantum of pre-transfer costs, the level of recoverable costs should generally remain within the ranges set out in Appendix G: at [32]–[33].4 The pre-transfer work carried out on behalf of CYX involved considering CYW’s application to set aside the arbitral award made in the arbitration between the parties and an affidavit which although lengthy, contained documents which had only limited relevance to the proceedings. Taking into account the complexity of the matter, clause 14.2 of the Security Deed and the range suggested in Appendix G, the appropriate order for costs in respect of the pre-transfer period was S$10,000 together with GST at 7%, making a total of S$10,700: at [34]–[35].Post-transfer costs5 The question before the court was whether the costs claimed were proportionate to the issues involved, reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount. The court dealt with them by reference to the periods referred to in the costs schedule supplied by CYX, whilst recognising that in considering the amounts claimed in the later periods, regard must be had to whether what was claimed in these periods was reasonably incurred having regard to the work done in the earlier periods: at [37]. 6 For the period between 7 October 2022 and 31 December 2022, the work carried out by CYX’s counsel involved preparation of an affidavit filed on behalf of CYX, preparation of CYX’s case management bundle, reviewing the case management bundle supplied by CYW and preparation of a draft joint case management bundle. In all the circumstances and having regard to the issues involved in the proceedings, the significance of the proceedings to the parties and clause 14.2 of the Security Deed, CYX was awarded the amount claimed in the period between 7 October 2022 and 31 December 2022, being S$43,335: at [39] and [44].7 For the period from 27 January 2023 up to and including the hearing on 16 March 2023, the work said to be done included the preparation of written submissions and bundles of authorities, reviewing CYW’s written submissions and bundles of authorities, attending the hearing, and conducting case analysis, documentation review and legal research. Taking into account the importance of the litigation to the parties, the complexity of the litigation, clause 4.2 of the Security Deed and the costs said to have been incurred by CYW over the same period, the costs claimed by CYX were disproportionate to what was involved in the proceedings and to a not insignificant extent unreasonably incurred. This was particularly the case where S$43,335 was claimed by CYX as post-transfer costs for the period between 7 October and 31 December 2022. In all the circumstances, the costs for this period claimed by CYX was reduced by approximately 25% to S$88,500 with a corresponding reduction in GST, resulting in a sum of S$95,580: at [46] and [49]–[50].8 So far as the post-judgment costs were concerned, having regard to the fact that CYX had the carriage of the costs application, the amount claimed by CYX of S$16,383.60 was not unreasonable: at [51].9 It was not contended by CYW that any of CYX’s disbursements were unreasonably incurred, and the disbursements claimed by CYX totalling S$5,539.01 were regarded as having been properly incurred: at [6(d)] and [52].Conclusion10 The court therefore ordered CYW to pay CYX its costs of the proceedings in an amount of S$174,734.41 inclusive of GST and disbursements: at [53].This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the court’s grounds of decision.
