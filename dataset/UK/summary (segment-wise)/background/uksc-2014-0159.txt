in june 2006 the appellant, hastings borough council (the council), exercised its emergency powers to restrict public access to hastings pier on account of its being in a dangerous condition as a result of serious structural defects. the respondent, manolete partners plc (manolete), pursued a claim for compensation against the council for loss to business as a result of the councils emergency closure of the pier. manolete brought the claim as an assignee of the business stylus sports ltd (stylus), which went into liquidation in late 2011. stylus had leased two units from the freeholder of the pier, ravenclaw investments incorporated (ravenclaw), and had operated a bingo hall and amusement arcade. two years before the closure of the pier, stylus had commissioned a structural engineering survey of the pier, which advised that urgent and future work, within a year, was required to the structure of the pier to prevent an unacceptable risk to the public. ravenclaw, which was responsible as landlord for repair and renewal of the pier structure, did not take action to remedy the defects identified. nor did the council, and the pier remained open to the public. in april 2006, a section of tension cord fell from the pier. this led the council to attempt, unsuccessfully, to compel ravenclaw to take action, and to commission its own structural integrity report, which in june 2006 recommended immediate restrictions on access to the pier. the council exercised its emergency powers under section 78 of the 1984 act, and in september 2006 obtained a court order under section 77, prohibiting public access to the pier until the necessary remedial works had been carried out. section 106 of the building act 1984 (the 1984 act), requires compensation to be paid for loss to a business resulting from emergency action, but only where the owner or occupier of the premises has not been in default. the council alleged that stylus had breached the occupiers liability act 1957, which imposes a duty of care towards visitors, and the health and safety at work act 1974, which imposes a duty on an employer to ensure the safety of his employees and the safety of the workplace. the council sought to rely on these alleged breaches to establish a default, thereby precluding manolete from making a compensation claim under the 1984 act. this defence was rejected by the technology and construction court and the court of appeal, on the basis that the reference to default was limited default in respect of obligations imposed by the 1984 act itself.
