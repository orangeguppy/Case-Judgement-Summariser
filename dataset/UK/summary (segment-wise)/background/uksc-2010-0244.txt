this appeal concerns the liability of a local authority to pay the costs of a party to care proceedings. the proceedings related to two children, whose parents were separated. the local authority applied for a care order under section 31 (2) children act 1989 in response to the making of allegations by the children that they had suffered sexual abuse by their father and six other men, in which the fathers parents (the grandparents) had colluded. the six men and the grandparents were joined to the care proceedings as interveners. the judge conducted a lengthy fact-finding hearing, as a result of which he exonerated five of the six men and the grandparents of any such abuse. the interveners were entitled to be represented at the hearing. the six men qualified for legal aid but the grandparents did not. they incurred costs of 52,000, which they met by taking out a mortgage on their house. at the end of the hearing they applied for an order that the local authority should pay their costs on the ground that they had succeeded in defending the allegations made against them. it was accepted that the local authority had acted reasonably in bringing the proceedings. the judge refused their application on the basis that it was not usual to order costs in a child case against a party unless that partys conduct had been unreasonable or reprehensible. the court of appeal allowed the grandparents appeal, holding that costs could be awarded in respect of discrete fact-finding hearings. although it rarely hears appeals relating solely to costs, the supreme court granted permission to appeal because of the important point of principle raised by the appeal, on terms that, whatever the result, the grandparents entitlement to recover their costs as a result of the order of the court of appeal would not be disturbed.
