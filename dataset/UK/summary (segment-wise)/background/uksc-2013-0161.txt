these two appeals concern the claims of two eu nationals to claim benefits in the united kingdom. ms mirga was born in poland and, having previously lived in the uk with her parents for four years, moved back here in 2004. the benefit rights of people from poland in the uk were mostly governed by the accession (immigration and worker registration) regulations 2004 (si 2004/1219) (the a8 regulations) which were enacted to give effect to the treaty on accession 2003 (the accession treaty) under which poland (and seven other countries) joined the eu. after finishing her education in april 2005, she carried out registered work within the meaning of the a8 regulations for seven months. she then became pregnant and did around three months of unregistered work. ms mirga claimed income support in august 2006 under the income support (general) regulations (si 1987/1967) (the income support regulations) on the grounds of pregnancy. the secretary of state refused ms mirgas application for income support and his decision was upheld by the first-tier tribunal. the upper tribunal and then the court of appeal affirmed that decision, on the ground that ms mirga did not have a right of residence in the uk under the a8 regulations and therefore was excluded from income support by the income support regulations. mr samin was born in iraq in 1960. in 1992, he and his family were granted asylum in austria in 1992 and he was granted austrian citizenship the following year. he then became estranged from his wife and children and came to the uk in december 2005, since when he has lived here alone. where the a8 regulations do not apply, the benefit rights of eu nationals in the uk are mostly governed by the immigration (european economic area) regulations 2006 (si 2006/1003) (the eea regulations), issued pursuant to eu directive 2004/38/ec (the 2004 directive). mr samin is socially isolated and suffers from poor mental and physical health. mr samin occupied private accommodation until 2010, when he applied to westminster city council (the council) for housing under the homelessness provisions of the housing act 1996 (the housing act). the council decided that he was a person from abroad who is not eligible for housing assistance within the meaning of section 185(1) of the housing act, because he did not have the right of residence in the uk under the eea regulations. that decision was affirmed in the central london county court, whose decision was in turn upheld by the court of appeal.
