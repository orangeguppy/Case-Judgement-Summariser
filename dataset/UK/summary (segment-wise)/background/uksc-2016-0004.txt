the appellant was in the care of the respondent local authority from the ages of seven to eighteen. the local authority placed her into foster care with mr and mrs a between march 1985 and march 1986, and with mr and mrs b between october 1987 and february 1988. she was physically and emotionally abused by mrs a, and sexually abused by mr b. the case proceeded on the basis that the local authority were not negligent in the selection or supervision of the foster parents, but that they were nevertheless liable for the abuse perpetrated by her foster carers. she claimed that the local authority were liable for the abuse, either on the basis that they were in breach of a non-delegable duty, or on the basis that they were vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of the foster parents. her claim was dismissed by the high court and the court of appeal.
