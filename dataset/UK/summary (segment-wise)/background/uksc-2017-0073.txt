nottingham city council, the appellant, is the licensing authority for houses in multiple occupation (hmos) in its area under part 2 of the housing act 2004 (2004 act). this appeal concerns two hmos, 44, rothesay avenue and 50, bute avenue which are owned by the second respondent, trevor parr associates ltd. the first respondent, dominic parr, is the managing director of the second respondent and the manager of the two hmos. the 2004 act requires hmos to be licensed by the local housing authority. the local housing authority can grant the application under section 64 of the 2004 act if it is satisfied that, among other requirements, the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons [specified in the application or decided by the authority] or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of conditions under section 67 [of the 2004 act]. the appellant issued guidance on the operation of the licensing system, which provides that the minimum space provision in the case of bedrooms in single occupation in hmos is eight square metres, although a degree of flexibility is sometimes possible if other features are present. 44, rothesay avenue and 50, bute avenue are both used for letting to students and each has an attic bedroom with an area of useable living space below eight square metres. in each case, the appellant granted an hmo licence which imposed a condition prohibiting the use of the attic bedroom for sleeping. the respondents appealed to the first-tier tribunal against the imposition of the conditions. the first- tier tribunal at separate hearings deleted the conditions imposed by the appellant. in the case of 44, rothesay avenue it substituted a condition that the attic bedroom may only be used for sleeping accommodation by a full-time student who resides in the bedroom for a maximum of ten months in each year. the appellant appealed both decisions to the upper tribunal, which dismissed the appeals and also directed that the substituted condition be included in the hmo licence for 50, bute avenue. the appellant then appealed to the court of appeal, which upheld the decision of the upper tribunal and included further conditions in both hmo licences that the communal space be kept available for communal living only and that no bedrooms be let to persons other than full-time students. the appellant appealed to the supreme court contending that the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 act cannot be used to limit the class of persons for whom the hmo is suitable, and that the conditions imposed by the first-tier tribunal, upper tribunal and the court of appeal are irrational and unenforceable.
