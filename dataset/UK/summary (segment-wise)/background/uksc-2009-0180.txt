this appeal concerns the question of whether article 8 of the european convention on human rights (article 8) requires uk courts to consider the proportionality of evicting an occupier from his home in claims for possession by local authorities and, if so, whether the demoted tenancy regime in the housing acts 1985 and 1996 (the 1985 act and 1996 act respectively) can properly be interpreted so as to comply with the requirements of article 8. most residential occupiers of local authority properties are secure tenants under part iv of the 1985 act who cannot be evicted other than pursuant to the grounds in section 84 of the 1985 act. the anti-social behaviour act 2003 act gave the courts power, however, to remove this security of tenure by making a demotion order. a demoted tenancy will last for a year and then revert to being a secure tenancy, unless within that year the landlord brings possession proceedings under section 143d of the 1996 act effectively requesting a court to end the demoted tenancy. section 143d(2) provides that the court must make an order for possession unless it thinks that the procedure under sections 143e and 143f has not been followed. under sections 143e and 143f of the 1996 act, before issuing possession proceedings against a demoted tenant, the landlord must serve a notice informing the tenant, inter alia, of its decisions (with reasons why) to seek possession and, if so requested by the tenant, must carry out a review of its decision. the appellant, cleveland pinnock, is a demoted tenant. he contests a possession order made against him under section 143d. mr pinnock has lived in a property owned by the respondent local authority, manchester city council (the council), for over 30 years with his partner, ms walker, and, from time to time, with all or some of their five children. the demotion order was made on the basis of a number of incidents of serious anti-social behaviour caused by all members of mr pinnocks family (other than mr pinnock himself) at or near the property. a day before the effective lapse of the demoted tenancy, the council served a notice under section 143e seeking possession of the property and citing further incidents of anti-social behaviour by mr pinnocks sons which had occurred after the demotion order. a review under section 143f effectively upheld the councils possession notice. the council then issued a claim for possession in the manchester county court. following a two-day hearing, the court granted an order for possession of the property. mr pinnock appealed to the court of appeal, who dismissed his appeal. mr pinnock then appealed to the supreme court. mr pinnocks main contention is that the possession order violates his right to respect for his home under article 8 as it is disproportionate. in view of the previous line of the house of lords authorities, both the manchester county court and the court of appeal rejected mr pinnocks article 8 arguments on the basis that it was not open to them to review the councils decision on the ground that it was disproportionate. approaching the matter on a domestic law basis, both courts concluded that the councils decision to seek possession was rational.
