ms janah is a moroccan national who was recruited in libya to work as a domestic worker for the libyan government at its london embassy. ms benkharbouche is a moroccan national who was recruited in iraq to work for sudan at its london embassy. both were dismissed from their employment and then issued claims in the employment tribunal against libya and sudan respectively. some of their claims were based on eu law. others were based on breach of contract or on purely domestic statutes of the united kingdom. in both actions the employment tribunal dismissed the claims on the basis that libya and sudan were entitled to state immunity under the state immunity act 1978 (1978 act). the employment appeal tribunal (eat) heard ms janahs and ms benkharbouches appeals together. the eat allowed the appeals and held that those sections were incompatible with article 47 of the eu charter of fundamental rights and freedoms (eu charter) which reflects the right in eu law to a remedy before a tribunal. the eat consequently disapplied sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) of the 1978 act insofar as those sections barred the claims which were based on eu law. the court of appeal affirmed the judgment of the eat and declared those sections of the 1978 act to be incompatible with the right to access a court, under article 6 of the european convention on human rights (echr). the secretary of state appeals in both cases.
