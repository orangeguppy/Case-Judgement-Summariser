the appellant was arrested in the united kingdom in 2017 and charged with one count of conspiracy to commit torture and seven counts of torture, contrary to section 134 of the criminal justice act 1988 (cja). the charges relate to events in the early stages of the first liberian civil war in 1990 when an armed group, the national patriotic front of liberia (npfl), took control of parts of liberia. its leader, charles taylor, subsequently became president of liberia in 1997. the point of law raised in the appeal, and certified by the court below, relates to the correct interpretation of the term person acting in an official capacity in section 134(1) of the cja. the prosecution maintained that at the time and place of the alleged offences, the npfl was the de facto military government with effective control of the relevant area. charles taylor and those acting for and with him, including the appellant, were therefore acting in an official capacity for, and on behalf of, the npfl. the appellant denied involvement in the offences and asserted that at no time did she act in an official capacity for the npfl, nor was the npfl the de facto government authority in the relevant locations. the appellant made an application to dismiss the charges. the judge concluded that section 134 applies not only to entities tolerated by or acting under the authority of a government but also, in situations of armed conflict, to individuals who act in a non-private capacity as part of an authority-wielding entity. accordingly, the judge ruled that there was a case to answer on all counts. the appellant appealed to the court of appeal, which dismissed the appeal, holding that section 134 cja is not confined to individuals acting on behalf of a state. it held that section 134 covers any person who acts otherwise than in a private and individual capacity for or on behalf of an organisation or body which exercises or purports to exercise the functions of government over the civilian population, whether in peace time or during armed conflict. the appellant appealed the decision to the supreme court.
