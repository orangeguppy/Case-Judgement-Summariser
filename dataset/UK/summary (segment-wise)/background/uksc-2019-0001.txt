this appeal raises two important questions about the interpretation and application of the planning (listed buildings and conservation areas) act 1990 (the listed buildings act). the case concerns the correct treatment of a pair of early 18th century lead urns resting on limestone pedestals (the items). the items were originally commissioned for a historic garden at wrest park in bedfordshire where they remained until 1939 but have been moved a number of times since then. in 1973 they were moved by major dill (mr dills father) to the garden of idlicote house. in june 1986 the items were added to the list of listed buildings under s.54 of the town and country planning act 1971. there is no record of notice of the listing having been served, but in due course it was included in the register of local land charges. in 1993 the mr dill (the appellant) acquired the house and the items. he was not aware of the items presence on the list. in 2009 he sold them at auction. on 29 april 2015 the district council (the second respondents) wrote to the mr dill informing him that listed building consent had been required for the items to be removed. his retrospective application for consent was refused on 11 february 2016, following which on 26 april 2016 the council issued a listed building enforcement notice requiring the reinstatement of the items at idlicote house. he appealed against the refusal of listed building consent and the issuing of the enforcement notice to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government (the first respondent). the grounds of appeal included the argument that the items were not buildings for the purposes of the listed buildings act. the appeals were dismissed by a planning inspector on 19 january 2017. he took the view that the status of the items as buildings was established by the listing; that he could not reconsider the issue. mr dills appeal was rejected by the high court (singh j) and the court of appeal (mccombe and coulson ljj). both courts below held that listing was conclusive of the items being buildings.
