this appeal involves a challenge to the compatibility of the police power contained in s 60 criminal justice and public order act 1994 (s 60), with the right to respect for private life protected by article 8 of the european convention on human rights (echr). s 60 permits a police officer to stop and search any person or vehicle for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments, whether or not he has any grounds for suspecting that the person or vehicle is carrying them, when an authorisation from a senior police officer, which must be limited in time and place, is in force. on 9 september 2010, in response to a period of gang related violence in haringey, superintendent barclay authorised the carrying out of searches under s 60 for 17 hours in parts of the borough, concluding that it was a proportionate response to protect members of the public from serious violence. that day, police constable jacqui reid was called to an incident in tottenham involving a passenger who had not paid her fare on the no. 149 bus. the passenger was the appellant, mrs roberts. she had denied having identification with her and kept a tight hold on her bag. pc reid used the power under s 60 to search her bag, which enabled mrs roberts name to be established from a bank card. mrs roberts brought judicial review proceedings against the police alleging breaches of a number of her rights under the echr. both the high court and court of appeal rejected her claims. the only claim pursued in her appeal to the supreme court was the alleged breach of article 8. she sought a declaration of incompatibility under s 4 human rights act 1998 on the ground that the power is not in accordance with the law. article 8 requires the law to be sufficiently accessible and foreseeable for an individual to regulate his conduct accordingly and to have sufficient safeguards against the risk that it will be used in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner
