as originally enacted, s.33 and part 1 of schedule 2 to the road traffic offenders act 1988 (the rtoa) provided that the maximum sentence that a sheriff sitting summarily could impose in respect of the offence of driving while disqualified (s.103(1)(b) of the road traffic act 1988 (the rta)) was six months imprisonment or the statutory maximum fine or both. if the offence was prosecuted on indictment, the maximum sentence was 12 months imprisonment or a fine or both. following a recommendation by a committee appointed to review the provision of summary justice in scotland that the criminal jurisdiction of judges sitting summarily should be increased to a maximum of 12 months, the criminal proceedings etc (reform)(scotland) act 2007 (the 2007 act) was enacted by the scottish parliament. s.45 of that act increased the maximum sentence that sheriffs sitting summarily could impose for the offence of driving while disqualified to 12 months imprisonment. on 17 december 2007 and 14 may 2008, respectively, in summary proceedings sean martin and ross miller were each sentenced by sheriffs to periods in excess of six months imprisonment for driving while disqualified contrary to s.103(1)(b) of the rta. they both sought to challenge their sentences on the basis that amending the relevant provisions of the 2007 act were outside the legislative competence of the scottish parliament. the high court of justiciary (the hcj) dismissed the appeals, holding that the increase in the sentencing power of sheriffs sitting summarily by s.45 of the 2007 act was within the scottish parliaments legislative competence. the hcj gave the appellants permission to appeal to the supreme court.
