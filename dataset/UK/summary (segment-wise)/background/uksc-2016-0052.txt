the appellant was convicted of drug trafficking offences on 21 may 1999 and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. on 29 march 2000, he was ordered to pay a little over 5.4 million by way of a confiscation order. the order required the appellant to pay the amount within 12 months or serve six years imprisonment in default of payment. on 4 may 2007, a receiver appointed to realise the appellants assets paid 12,500. the magistrates deducted seven days from the six-year term in default, to account for that part payment. at that time interest had increased the net sum outstanding, allowing for the part payment, to 8.1 million. later in 2007 and 2011, the appellants receiver made further payments of 12,500 and 65,370. the prison authorities calculated the reduction in the six-year default term on the basis of the proportion which these payments bore to the 8.1 million at the time of his committal. that produced a total reduction of 24 days. had the arithmetic been applied instead to an outstanding figure confined to the original 5.4m, an extra 11 days reduction would have been made. the issue in the appeal is whether interest is included in the starting point under s.79(2) magistrates courts act 1980 for the giving of proportionate credit for part payment of a confiscation order.
