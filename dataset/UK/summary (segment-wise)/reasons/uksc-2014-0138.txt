the power found in s 60 is one of the few instances where parliament has decided that stop and search powers without reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of an offence are necessary for the protection of the public from terrorism or serious crime. it was common ground in the appeal that the power interferes with the right to respect for private life but that it pursues a legitimate aim which is capable of justification under article 8(2). the issue was whether it also satisfied article 8(2) by being in accordance with the law [3]. s 60 is directed towards the risk of violence involving knives and other offensive weapons in a particular locality. it depends on an authorisation by an officer of the rank of inspector or above, who reasonably believes that incidents involving serious violence may take place in any locality in his police area, and that an authorisation of up to 24 hours (renewable once) is expedient to prevent their occurrence by allowing stops and searches in order to discover offensive weapons. the exercise of the powers is subject to numerous safeguards and restrictions in the police and criminal evidence act 1984, the code of practice and the standard operating procedures of the metropolitan police. failure to comply with these safeguards renders the exercise of compulsory powers which interfere with individual freedom unlawful [7, 28-37]. the authorisation made on 9 september 2010 followed police intelligence reports indicating a risk of further violence in connection with rival gangs. when pc reid attended the incident she considered that the appellant was holding her bag in a suspicious manner, and her experience was that it was not uncommon for women of a similar age to carry weapons for other people. she therefore conducted a search of the appellants bag exercising the s 60 power, and provided the appellant with a form explaining these reasons [10-13]. this is the first challenge to the s 60 power to come before the court. previous case-law concerning similar stop and search powers establishes that some but not every suspicion-less power would fail the requirement of lawfulness under the echr. it is often important to the effectiveness of the powers that they be exercised randomly and unpredictably. the question is whether the legal framework permits the court to examine the propriety of the exercise of the power [15-26]. whatever the scope of the power, it must be operated in a manner which is compatible with the echr rights of any individual and be free of discrimination [42]. these constraints, together with disciplinary sanctions against police officers, guard against the risk that the s 60 power will be exercised when the officer does not in fact have good reasons for the decision [43]. the requirements attaching to the authorisation [44], the operation [45] and the actual encounter on the street [46], in particular the requirement to give reasons, should make it possible to judge whether the action was necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime. the law itself is not incompatible with article 8 [47]. accordingly, a declaration under the human rights act should not be made. nor should there be a declaration that the guidance current at the time was inadequate or that the particular search of the appellant was not in accordance with the law [48].
