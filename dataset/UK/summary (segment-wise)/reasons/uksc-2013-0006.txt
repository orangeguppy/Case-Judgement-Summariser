it is an established principle of the common law of receivership that a court-appointed receiver may draw his remuneration and expenses to the assets placed by the court in his/her control. the receiver has a lien over those assets for that purpose [44]. that common law, together with the provisions of poca and the criminal procedure rules, provide amply clear and foreseeable authority for the making of such order, and laws lj was correct so to hold [83]. the critical question in this case is not foreseeability, but proportionality. would it be disproportionate to order that the receivers expenses be drawn from the companies? [87]. the taking of property without compensation is, in general, a disproportionate interference with a1p1 [88]. in this case the group were neither defendants nor (as the court of appeal found) was there any reasonable cause for regarding the group assets as those of the defendants at the time when it was made [89], [125-130]. divesting the group of its assets in that situation is disproportionate [94]. it is as if the assets of an innocent defendant were sought to be used to cover the costs of detaining and prosecuting him or her [92]. the receivers application to recover his expenses from eastenders group therefore fails [96]. however, that conclusion would leave the court in an invidious position, since to leave the receiver without recompense would violate his a1p1 rights [96]. the receiver had, however, entered on his receivership pursuant to a letter of agreement with the cps [98]. it was the mutual expectation of both the receiver and the cps that the receiver would have a legally enforceable lien over the receivership property [99]. unjust enrichment may cover a variety of situations. failure of services at the request of another is capable of being regarded as enrichment, and it would be unjust if the receiver were not paid for the services which he provided [100-117]. hence the receiver has a claim in unjust enrichment against the cps [117]. the restraint and receivership orders were made in this case on an application at short notice. applications by the cps for such orders should be made as early as possible, with proper time estimates and reading lists, enabling the court to consider the necessary arrangements [118-119]. the fact that such applications are made ex parte places a special burden of candour on the cps and considerable responsibility upon the court [120]. failure to discharge the duty of candour could well be considered serious misconduct [121]. the court should always consider such applications carefully: making such orders should never be a rubber-stamping exercise. in certain cases, it could be appropriate to attach a piggott condition to a receivership order providing that if property was shown not to be realisable property, the receivers costs should fall on the cps [124].
