lord reed sets out the principles governing review of a trial courts findings of fact [58-69]. the extra division was correct to identify that an appellate court can interfere where satisfied that the trial judge has gone plainly wrong, but it erred in concluding that this criterion was met in the present case [62]. plainly does not refer to the degree of confidence felt by the appellate court that it would not have reached the same conclusion as the trial judge. what matters is whether the decision under appeal is one that no reasonable judge could have reached [62]; that the decision cannot reasonably be explained or justified [66-68]. lord glennie did not err in law; he clearly understood the critical issue under section 242(4)(b) to be whether the alienation was made for adequate consideration [22]. he was aware that an obligation on the part of nsl could only constitute part of the consideration for the sale if it was undertaken as the counterpart of the obligations undertaken by lgdc [25]. his opinion had understandably focused on the question on which the parties had joined issue, namely whether not when any obligation was taken to assume the lgdc debts [26]. lord glennie was entitled to accept mr lius evidence on this point [27]. lord reed rejects the criticisms made of lord glennies treatment of the evidence [29-57]. the fact that lord glennie was less impressed by the liquidators case than the extra division reflected a careful and nuanced assessment of the evidence, and an understanding of the commercial realities [29]. he had taken into account the various criticisms of mr lius evidence before concluding that his evidence was credible and reliable. the weight given to the material evidence was pre-eminently a matter for the lord ordinary, subject only to the requirement that his findings be such as might reasonably be made [57]. before the supreme court, the parties accepted that no prejudice would be occasioned by remitting the question of expenses in the outer house to the lord ordinary [72]. they are invited to make submissions as to the appropriate form of order [73].
