the husband was granted permission to appeal to the supreme court only on a single ground - whether, in light of the fact that provision had already been made for the wifes housing needs in the capital settlement, the court of appeal was entitled to interfere with the judges decision not to increase the periodical payments so as to cover all of the wifes current rental costs [32]. the court of appeal had erred in saying that the judge had given no reason for declining to increase the order for periodical payments the judge had given a clear reason, namely that the wifes unwise decisions in relation to her capital had increased her basic needs by requiring her to pay rent, and that it was consequently unfair to expect the husband to meet these increased needs in full [33]. the court of appeal should have considered the impact of the original capital payment on the wifes current need to pay rent, and this involved a consideration of three earlier court of appeal authorities: pearce v pearce [2003] ewca civ 1054, north v north [2007] ewca civ 760, and yates v yates [2012] ewca civ 532 [34-38]. these cases were correctly decided and in light of this the judge was entitled, although not obliged, to decline to require the husband to fund payment of the rent in full. this respects the wide discretion conferred upon the court under s. 31(1) and (7) of the matrimonial causes act 1973 in determining an application for variation of an order for periodical payments. moreover, a court would need to give very good reasons for requiring a spouse to fund payment of the other spouses rent in the circumstances of this case. a spouse may well be obliged to make provision for the other spouse, but an obligation to duplicate that provision in situations such as this is improbable [40].
