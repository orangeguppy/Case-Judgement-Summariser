lord clarke, with whom all other members of the court agree, considered the first two questions together as both involve the construction of the 1940 act. although section 3(2) is specifically intended to deal with the position where there are two actions it is not limited to such a case and the claim for contribution could be made by third party proceedings in the same action (paras [11]-[12]). the words if sued are to be construed as meaning relevantly, competently and timeously sued (para [14]). the question under section 3(2) is whether, if asco had been sued by farstad, it would have been liable. that depends upon whether asco would have had a defence to farstads claim. the outcome of the appeal therefore depends upon the true construction of the charterparty, with the essential question being whether clause 33.5 of the charterparty excludes ascos liability to farstad in respect of damage to the vessel caused by ascos own negligence (paras [15]-[16]). the court found that it does (paras [24], [29]). enviroco is not entitled to contribution from asco under section 3(2) of the 1940 act because it cannot establish that if sued asco might have been liable to farstad in respect of losses caused by the fire (paras [15], [16], [19]-[29]). this conclusion makes the remaining question - whether the position would be different if clause 33.5 were only an indemnity rather than an exclusion clause - irrelevant. the court did not accept the argument that, if clause 33.5 was only an indemnity clause farstad would have been entitled to a joint and several decree against both asco and enviroco and both would be found joint and severally liable in damages within the meaning of section 3(1) of the 1940 act. the charterparty is governed by english law and such a claim by farstad would be met by the defence of circuity of action. in other words, it would be useless in such circumstances to give judgment for farstad against asco as there could be no order of the court that asco pay damages to farstad. although not called circuity of action, scots law applies what is in effect the same principle. therefore, even if it were a matter of scots law, the answer would be the same and any action by farstad against asco would clearly fail (paras [30]-[34], [44], [59]). in his judgment, lord rodger confirmed that the courts construction of section 3(2) is in line with the established case law of the courts of new zealand and canada on similar provisions. the policy which underlies the decisions of those courts is equally applicable to scots law. the appeal is allowed and the decision of the lord ordinary is restored.
