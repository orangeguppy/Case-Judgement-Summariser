the only true question in the case is whether mr stotts claim falls within the scope of the montreal convention. there is no dispute between mr stott and thomas cook as to the interpretation of the ec regulations or uk regulations, or their compatibility with the convention. the eu cases do not assist: that other regulation concerned general standardised measures, and the european court had recognised that any claim for individualised damages would be subject to the convention. the case raised no question of european law [54-59]. on substantive scope: the convention was intended to deal comprehensively with the liability of the air carrier for whatever might physically happen to passengers between embarkation or disembarkation. the fact that mr stotts claim relates to disability discrimination makes no difference. the underlying difficulty is that the montreal convention and its predecessors long pre- dated equality laws. it is unfair that someone suffering as mr stott had could not obtain any compensation, but that is the plain meaning of the convention. it would be desirable for the states parties to the convention to consider its amendment. it is also possible that the civil aviation authority could take other enforcement actions against thomas cook [61-64]. on temporal scope: the operative causes of mr stotts treatment undoubtedly began at check-in, prior to embarkation. however, this is not enough. mr stotts claim is for damages for the humiliation and distress that mr stott had suffered during the course of the flight, which fall squarely within the convention period of exclusivity. to hold otherwise would encourage deft pleading and would circumvent the purpose of the convention [60]. in her concurring judgment, lady hale considers it disturbing that the convention excludes damages claims for breaches of individuals fundamental rights. it is particularly unsettling that this applies not only to private air carriers such as thomas cook, but also to state airlines. a treaty which contravened a fundamental international law norm would be void. torture is a fundamental norm of this kind, and race discrimination might be another. there is a respectable view that mr stotts treatment would, under the european convention on human rights, constitute inhuman and degrading treatment (idt). however, it appears that idt has not yet become a fundamental international law norm. since thomas cook is not a state air carrier, these issues do not arise in this case. at the very least, however, the grave injustice done to those in mr stotts position should be addressed by the parties to the convention [67-70].
