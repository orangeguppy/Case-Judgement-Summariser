(1) all members of the court agree that the common law rule in barker remains unaltered in guernsey where the 2006 act does not apply. [27-31]. only 22.08% of iegs loss is thus attributable to the period of the midland insurance for which zurich must answer [35]. (2) the defence costs are different. they would have been incurred in defending the claim whatever the total period of exposure by gglcl. they were incurred with insurers consent, in defending a claim for damages for injury or disease caused during the midland insurance period within the meaning of the main insuring clause. under the rule in fairchild, as applied in trigger, mesothelioma is caused in any period in which exposure occurs which materially contributed to the risk of contracting mesothelioma [36-39]. (3) had guernsey had an equivalent to the 2006 act, ieg would have been liable to mr carr for his full 100% loss whether it had exposed him to asbestos for actual 27 years or only for the 6 years of the midland insurance cover. but it would be anomalous if zurich had to answer for the full 100% loss without any defence or right of recourse. in this situation, the majority holds that, although zurich must in the first instance answer for the full 100%, zurich has equitable rights to contribution pro rata from any other insurer (such as excess) able to contribute and, in respect of any period where there is no such insurer, from ieg itself. [42-54], [63] and [77-78]. the minority considers that zurich is only liable to ieg in the first instance for 22.08% of the full loss [180-187]. (4) lord mances judgment also discusses the position under the third party (rights against insurers) act 1930 had ieg been insolvent, and concludes that it is probable that mr carr would in such a case have been able to look to zurich for his full 100% loss [97].
