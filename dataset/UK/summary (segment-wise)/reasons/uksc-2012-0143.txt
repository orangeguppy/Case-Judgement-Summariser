first ground: mr obrien argued that if his contempt satisfied the definition of extradition offence in s. 148 of the 2003 act, s. 151a precluded a united kingdom court dealing with him for that contempt [14-16]. mr obriens argument required reading these two sections in isolation. however, it is necessary to see how those sections fit into the structure of the 2003 act [20]. each of parts 1-3 of the 2003 act contain a similar definition of extradition offence, in each case referring to conduct punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment, with a common structure across the definitions [21]. the extradition act 1989 was replaced by the 2003 act in order to implement, in part 1 of the 2003 act, an eu framework decision [22]. under the framework decision, it is a prerequisite of a valid arrest warrant that the conduct of which the person is accused or has been convicted constitutes a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state [25]. in relation to part 1 (dealing with extradition from the uk to other member states), the definition of extradition offence accordingly requires that an offence either be a listed extraditable offence or an offence under the law of the united kingdom [28]. a similar scheme is in place in relation to extradition from the uk to those non-eu countries with which the uk has extradition arrangements, governed by part 2 of the 2003 act. so, sections 137 and 138 of the 2003 act require that an extradition offence concerns conduct which would constitute an offence under uk law [29-30]. that accords with the essential nature of extradition as it has been understood in the uk [31-33]. part 3 of the 2003 act deals with extradition to the uk. s. 148 (within part 3) has no direct application to this case, since the uk judiciary is not involved in the process of obtaining mr obriens extradition [35]. nonetheless s. 151a should be understood in the light of the wider scheme of the 2003 act. it is clear that nothing can constitute an extradition offence unless it is a criminal offence under the relevant state, here the uk [36]. second ground: a restraint order under poca is an interim remedy, aiming to prevent the disposal of realisable assets during a criminal investigation. the crown court has an inherent jurisdiction to treat breach of such orders as contempt of court [37-38]. there is a well-recognised distinction between criminal contempt, covering conduct itself a crime, and civil contempt, covering conduct which is not itself a crime but is punishable by the court in order that the courts orders be observed. a civil contemnor does not receive a criminal record [39-41]. if a victim of mr obriens fraud had obtained a freezing order against him similar to the poca restraint order and mr obrien had disobeyed and absconded, the victim would clearly have been able to bring contempt proceedings following his extradition [43]. there is no relevant difference with a poca order. the key is the nature and purpose of the order, not the court in which the order was made [44]. mr obriens contempt was civil, and his committal is not barred by the specialty principle.
