the secretary of state was under a public law duty to adhere to the terms of the policy relating to reviews unless there were good reasons not to: [36], [39], [66]. the majority of the court holds that the respondents unlawful failure to review the appellants detention, as required by the policy, resulted in his detention being unlawful. the court rejects the argument that because the breach of public law related to a procedural requirement, it did not affect the legality of the detention: [69] [73], [85]. some procedural requirements go to the legality of the detention and some do not: [71]. the policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain to qualify the secretary of states discretion under the 1971 act: [51]. the very point of the review was to ensure that the detention was lawful: [73], [86]. the public law error bore directly on the decision to detain the appellant and therefore satisfied the test adopted by the majority in lumba for determining when a public law error will result in detention being unlawful: [42], [88]. the appellants detention was not unlawful, however, where the only defect in the decision to continue detention was that the review had been carried out by an official of the wrong grade: [60]. as the court also held in lumba, it was no defence to the claim that there were grounds which justified the appellants detention: [54], [73], [88]. false imprisonment is a trespass to the person and actionable in itself, without proof of loss or damage: [74]. the result of the reviews which should have taken place is, however, relevant to assessing damages. a defendant is liable only for the loss which his wrongful act has caused. the full facts of this case are yet to be established, but if it is found that the claimant would not have been released had proper reviews been carried out, he will only be entitled to nominal damages: [55] [56], [74], [89]. lord brown (with whom lord rodger agrees) would have held that the failure to review the appellants detention did not result in the appellants detention being unlawful. they hold that the policy did not confer upon the appellant an entitlement to be released, but only an entitlement to be reviewed for release: [107]. once properly detained, a detainee remains lawfully imprisoned unless and until released on bail or by the secretary of states direction, or he establishes a substantive entitlement to release: [111]. lumba does not compel the majoritys result, because it was concerned with a substantive entitlement under the policy and not a procedural one, and because it also held that not every breach of public law resulted in detention being unlawful: [116] [118].
