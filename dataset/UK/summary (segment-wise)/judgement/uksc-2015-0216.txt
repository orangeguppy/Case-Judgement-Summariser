the supreme court unanimously allows the appeal on the basis of the echr challenge and the eu law challenge (to the extent it mirrors the echr challenge). the court invites written submissions as to the terms of its order under s.102 of the scotland act in order to give the scottish parliament and scottish ministers an opportunity to address the matters raised in the judgment. in the meantime, since the defective provisions of part 4 of the 2014 act are not within the legislative competence of the scottish parliament, they cannot be brought into force. lady hale, lord reed and lord hodge (with whom lord wilson and lord hughes agree) give the joint leading judgment.
