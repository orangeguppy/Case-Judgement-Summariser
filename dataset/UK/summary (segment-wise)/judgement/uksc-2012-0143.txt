the supreme court dismisses the appeal. the judgment of the court is given by lord toulson. on the first issue, the court holds that s. 151a does not directly apply to this case [34-35]. in any event, the sections relied upon by mr obrien cannot be read in isolation, and reading the act as a whole it is clear that conduct constituting an extradition offence must be a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state (here the uk) [36]. on the second issue, the court holds that there is a material distinction between civil and criminal contempt. the latter involves a serious interference with the administration of justice [41]. the former is an inherent power used by a senior court in order to ensure that its orders are observed. its primary purpose is to ensure that the courts orders are observed, and the contemnor does not acquire a criminal record [39-40]. in this case mr obriens disobedience to the common serjeants order constitutes civil contempt, which does not constitute an extradition offence [45].
