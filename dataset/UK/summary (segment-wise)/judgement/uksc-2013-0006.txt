the supreme court unanimously allows the receivers appeal (only) against the court of appeals refusal to have the cps to pay the receivers remuneration and expenses. lord toulson gives the leading judgment, with a short concurrence by lord hughes dealing with the practical application of the courts decision. it is a general principle of the law of receivership that a court-appointed receiver is entitled to remuneration from the assets of the administered company. that law is clear and foreseeable. however, where the administered company is not itself a defendant, nor at the time of the order was there any reasonable cause to regard its assets as the defendants, it would be a disproportionate interference with the companys a1p1 rights for the receivers remuneration to be drawn from the companys assets. however, to leave the receiver without a remedy would be to substitute one injustice for another and violate the receivers a1p1 rights. in this case the receiver and the cps acted on a common assumption, fundamental to the agreement, that the receiver would be able to claim his remuneration and expenses from the eastenders group. that assumption failed: the receiver accordingly has a valid right to restitution from the cps.
