the court unanimously holds that, in relation to the snatch land rover claims, pte hewett and pte ellis were within the uks jurisdiction for the purposes of the convention at the time of their deaths. by a majority (lords mance, wilson and carnwath dissenting), the court holds that: (i) the snatch land rover claims should not be struck out on the ground that the claims are not within the scope of article 2 of the convention; and (ii) the challenger claims and ellis negligence claim should not be struck out on the ground of combat immunity or on the ground that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to extend the mods duty of care to those cases [101]. the effect of the courts decision is that all three sets of claims may proceed to trial.
