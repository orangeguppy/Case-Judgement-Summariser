the supreme court, by a majority, allows the appeal. lord hope gives the leading judgment; lady hale and lord kerr issue separate concurring judgments. the majority holds that the appellants detention was unlawful for the periods in respect of which no review was carried out and that he does have a claim in tort for false imprisonment in respect of those periods. the amount of damages is yet to be ascertained, but will be nominal if it is found that the appellant would have been detained even if his detention had been reviewed as the policy required. lord brown gives a dissenting judgment, with which lord rodger agrees.
