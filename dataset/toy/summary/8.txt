the cardinal maxim to be observed by courts in constru ing a will is to endeavour to ascertain the infentions of the testator.
this intention has to be gathered primarily from the language of the document which is to be read as a whole without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised.
the courts are however entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used.
they must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure the court is entitled to put itself into the testator 's armchair '.
but all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construetion of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of the language when used by that particular testator in that document.
as soon as the construction is settled, the duty of the court is to carry out the intsentions as expressed.
the court is in no case justified in adding to testamentary dispositions.
in all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is 950 universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life.
a presumption against intestacy may be raised if it is justified by the context of the document or the surrounding circumstances; but it can be invoked only when there is undoubted ambignity in ascertainment of the intentions of the testator.
it cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning.
